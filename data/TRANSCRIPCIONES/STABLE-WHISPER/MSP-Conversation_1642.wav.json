{"text": " how are you today i'm all right i'm so grateful for you oh i'm grateful for you in general um i'm grateful to you for speaking to me today and yeah i'm i'm just blown away by what you've done on behalf of our gender you know this conversation has been going on for so many years now and well done you for bringing it to the forefront and making people want to take action about it thanks yeah it's interesting because i'm in this space a lot like i don't like a lot of my activism is around a lot of these issues and it just felt like it got to the point where those two things couldn't be separate anymore and that whole thing of like being quite privileged like i knew that i had the support of my team behind me i knew that i was like working on a project to deal with this so if somebody had questions about it i'd be like i'll actually like i am actually practically also implementing something in my professional capacity um and i just thought well somebody has to do it and i still think there'll be more like a lot of the conversations that have happened since have been about like whether people will name names and stuff and i think there are individuals who are starting to feel uh that they want to do that and obviously if they choose to do that then they can um so i think there's still i think there's going to be more like i think i've opened pandora's box a little bit um but actually there'll be some other people who either anonymously or publicly could have come to the forefront and say some stuff because it just takes one person to like knock the first domino and then there's lots of other amazing people who uh have been talking behind the scenes about this stuff um but now hopefully feel like that it's safer for them to do it more publicly which is kind of why i was hoping yeah my complaint was not because i was submitting it on behalf of someone anonymously and they said unless that person comes forward we can't take it any further um and at the time i think i just accepted that that's the way the system works but i've since heard that story from multiple different organizations from multiple different people you know unless unless the person who's been harassed abused assaulted comes forward we can't do anything about it um and i just felt really that's appalling yeah because i know of at least three times that that person has been reported about to that organization that i complained about and they're not yeah they're not recognizing that their system is allowing individuals to carry on abusing harassing assaulting women and within their workplaces or at their events yeah so they don't recognize that their systems are broken um yeah so and it goes back it goes back to what i was saying about believing women as well because it shouldn't take an individual putting themselves out there and harming themselves to for this to be taken seriously um particularly when there are multiple complaints against somebody uh anonymous testimony should be enough and as long as you have a body bringing that forward i don't understand um and i think it's you're right it's the systems are broken they're not just broken they're patriarchal systems aren't and go back to this again and again the systems are designed to shut us up when this stuff happens and they are designed that way because men have designed them and we can't skirt around that issue um and i don't mean like oh just men drafted x complaints policy i mean even the idea of how a complaints policy should be and the steps that it should take and what criteria we are allowed to report people on or not comes from a man's perspective and it will be very different if they've been designed by women um and i think well it would be very different if they've been designed by women who have you know really painful lived experience of it you know because i think about asking someone who has been raped or someone who has been abused that to share that with strangers is just ridiculous yeah that's the first stage of the of the process and it shouldn't be that way and our institutes and our organizations have a responsibility to do what they can to mitigate that um but it's it's really hard i think a lot of people are very focused on um the legalities and uh watching their own backs and covering their own backs uh which i can understand to a certain extent but i also think there has to be a point where we put our values as you say and people and their awful experiences before anything else like when are we going to start doing that isn't that what we're supposed to do for the charity sector i just yeah i think they have a long way to go and like firstly understanding the issue but then also thinking about what they might need to change to um to actually make a difference but they definitely have a role to play i mean my concern is that because of experiences like the one you've just mentioned because of some of the stories that people have come forward with particularly in the like guru space yeah it's just a huge barrier it's a barrier to be reported in the first place um and then it's obviously a barrier in terms of how seriously women are taken how much they're believed and then like what happens and i have people say to me like you know i tried to complain and then like this person this person who's their buddy this person and it just got shut down and that's so important so i don't know if you know anything about my history i had to resign from my job because i wasn't allowed to talk about diversity in public anymore just disgusting is the only word that i have written obviously i don't know the detail but i don't think you need to know the detail it just so i think part of the reason i had problems was because i'm um a new generation of chief exec so i have a better understanding of the way communication works nowadays and the way the media works and i've also worked i worked at change.org before i worked at the small charities coalition so i was just surrounded by activists who believed in their cause more than they believed in a brand name um you know and if a brand name becomes prohibitive to what they see as their personal mission then fuck the brand you know so i think part of the thing that fascinates me about you is that you do have an employer behind you and you are educating them as you go along about the way that you as an individual feel like you are entitled to speak at the moment um because i think historically charities have signed everything off and that's the only way they felt comfortable you know and there's so many big brands who will sign off a case study and what they mean is they will sign off what their beneficiaries are saying about their work to make sure it's 100 in line with everything they want to say and therefore they cut out the authenticity and the human element of it so i was amnesty international before so hence very similar to you okay i was somewhere obviously surrounded by activism that means doing it in a way which is more disruptive and more kind of self-organized and less let's sit on the task force when you talk about the activism that we're trying to do like i'm desperate to contribute however i can to whatever you're doing um in a helpful and supportive way um yeah i don't know what conversations are happening and how we can join those up and sure all that sort of stuff i mean to be honest like what i've been saying to everyone firstly i wrote the article i had no idea whether or not it would take off in the way that it has so i'm still trying to like reconcile that in my own head and also think about what i know about activism and organizing and campaigning and like trying to take a step back and actually think about it less emotionally and impulsively and think about it in a more strategic way um another thing i'm really interested like every single day a new conversation happens on twitter about this issue or a new email arrives in my inbox from somebody being like what about this what can i do about this so i kind of want to keep the conversation going which is what i'm trying to do but also allow them to play out because i think that's a really important part of this and kind of seeing where it goes uh but in a very conscious way so staying on top of the conversations at least the ones that happen in the public sphere and having my own behind closed doors so the only kind of tangible next step that i can see is there's a group of people who um who want to name somebody and they have approached me and said this is what we want to do and we're trying to set up a call to talk about what who that is because i don't know yet i can do a list of potentials yeah but i don't know who they're talking about um and how we would go about doing that because they want to do it anonymously i'm not sure how we would do that um but it's not something i'm going to shy away from either like people would be like oh it's not helpful to name names they just need to be eradicated from our sector like i don't care if this destroys somebody's career like if they are a predator then they deserve that to happen to them and like that's the end of the conversation stage for me so i'm not concerned about that i'm concerned about the people who are doing the reporting and the people who are doing the naming that's my primary concern and also what will that change um let's say that we do name for example the person that you just mentioned um if like we need to think about okay what are we trying to achieve by doing that yeah um as long as we're having that part of the conversation and if the answer to that is he doesn't speak at conferences anymore he doesn't what like we need to really think about the next step because i don't want to blow something up for blowing something up's case like i really not learned my lesson but i had a really interesting experience i was heavily involved internally with lobbying senior management to do more uh because i was chairing the women's group and um it got to the point where they just weren't listening and weren't listening and weren't listening went on for like nine months or something and i felt like i was at this crossroads looking like okay do i leak this to the press or do i take one more go like try and do this in a constructive way and it was so hard like i remember going home to my boyfriend and being like how can i possibly do that but at the same time like this is getting so beyond a joke that if that's the only way to force change then i'll do it anyway decided to take the second option of like putting it through in a constructive way one more time went to the union did it that way the union put forward a list of demands and it all seemed like it was actually going to be taken seriously and then the following week somebody else leaked it to the press and nothing's happened since because it completely undermined all of the work and the demands of the union and of the work that i'd want to undermine the work that i'd gone on internally so i've seen that not work like that doesn't work in terms of creating change unless you've thought very carefully about what you're hoping to achieve on the other side and so i think we just have to be really aware of that we're having these conversations about naming and we need to approach everything in an ad hoc way as well because a lot of these people are independent consultants and they're not you know we can't go to their line manager or their ceo or whatever we need to look at each case and think okay where are the levers that we can pull to hold this person accountable", "segments": [{"start": 0.06, "end": 3.04, "text": " how are you today i'm

you today i'm all right i'm so grateful for you oh i'm grateful for you in general um i'm grateful to you for speaking to me today and yeah i'm i'm just blown away by what you've done on behalf of our gender you know this conversation has been going on for so many years now and well done you for bringing it to the forefront and making people want to take action about it thanks yeah it's interesting because i'm in this space a lot like i don't like a lot of my activism is around a lot of these issues and it just felt like it got to the point where those two things couldn't be separate anymore and that whole thing of like being quite privileged like i knew that i had the support of my team behind me i knew that i was like working on a project to deal with this so if somebody had questions about it i'd be like i'll actually like i am actually practically also implementing something in my professional capacity um and i just thought well somebody has to do it and i still think there'll be more like a lot of the conversations that have happened since have been about like whether people will name names and stuff and i think there are individuals who are starting to feel uh that they want to do that and obviously if they choose to do that then they can um so i think there's still i think there's going to be more like i think i've opened pandora's box a little bit um but actually there'll be some other people who either anonymously or publicly could have come to the forefront and say some stuff because it just takes one person to like knock the first domino and then there's lots of other amazing people who uh have been talking behind the scenes about this stuff um but now hopefully feel like that it's safer for them to do it more publicly which is kind of why i was hoping yeah my complaint was not because i was submitting it on behalf of someone anonymously and they said unless that person comes forward we can't take it any further um and at the time i think i just accepted that that's the way the system works but i've since heard that story from multiple different organizations from multiple different people you know unless unless the person who's been harassed abused assaulted comes forward we can't do anything about it um and i just felt really that's appalling yeah because i know of at least three times that that person has been reported about to that organization that i complained about and they're not yeah they're not recognizing that their system is allowing individuals to carry on abusing harassing assaulting women and within their workplaces or at their events yeah so they don't recognize that their systems are broken um yeah so and it goes back it goes back to what i was saying about believing women as well because it shouldn't take an individual putting themselves out there and harming themselves to for this to be taken seriously um particularly when there are multiple complaints against somebody uh anonymous testimony should be enough and as long as you have a body bringing that forward i don't understand um and i think it's you're right it's the systems are broken they're not just broken they're patriarchal systems aren't and go back to this again and again the systems are designed to shut us up when this stuff happens and they are designed that way because men have designed them and we can't skirt around that issue um and i don't mean like oh just men drafted x complaints policy i mean even the idea of how a complaints policy should be and the steps that it should take and what criteria we are allowed to report people on or not comes from a man's perspective and it will be very different if they've been designed by women um and i think well it would be very different if they've been designed by women who have you know really painful lived experience of it you know because i think about asking someone who has been raped or someone who has been abused that to share that with strangers is just ridiculous yeah that's the first stage of the of the process and it shouldn't be that way and our institutes and our organizations have a responsibility to do what they can to mitigate that um but it's it's really hard i think a lot of people are very focused on um the legalities and uh watching their own backs and covering their own backs uh which i can understand to a certain extent but i also think there has to be a point where we put our values as you say and people and their awful experiences before anything else like when are we going to start doing that isn't that what we're supposed to do for the charity sector i just yeah i think they have a long way to go and like firstly understanding the issue but then also thinking about what they might need to change to um to actually make a difference but they definitely have a role to play i mean my concern is that because of experiences like the one you've just mentioned because of some of the stories that people have come forward with particularly in the like guru space yeah it's just a huge barrier it's a barrier to be reported in the first place um and then it's obviously a barrier in terms of how seriously women are taken how much they're believed and then like what happens and i have people say to me like you know i tried to complain and then like this person this person who's their buddy this person and it just got shut down and that's so important so i don't know if you know anything about my history i had to resign from my job because i wasn't allowed to talk about diversity in public anymore just disgusting is the only word that i have written obviously i don't know the detail but i don't think you need to know the detail it just so i think part of the reason i had problems was because i'm um a new generation of chief exec so i have a better understanding of the way communication works nowadays and the way the media works and i've also worked i worked at change.org before i worked at the small charities coalition so i was just surrounded by activists who believed in their cause more than they believed in a brand name um you know and if a brand name becomes prohibitive to what they see as their personal mission then fuck the brand you know so i think part of the thing that fascinates me about you is that you do have an employer behind you and you are educating them as you go along about the way that you as an individual feel like you are entitled to speak at the moment um because i think historically charities have signed everything off and that's the only way they felt comfortable you know and there's so many big brands who will sign off a case study and what they mean is they will sign off what their beneficiaries are saying about their work to make sure it's 100 in line with everything they want to say and therefore they cut out the authenticity and the human element of it so i was amnesty international before so hence very similar to you okay i was somewhere obviously surrounded by activism that means doing it in a way which is more disruptive and more kind of self-organized and less let's sit on the task force when you talk about the activism that we're trying to do like i'm desperate to contribute however i can to whatever you're doing um in a helpful and supportive way um yeah i don't know what conversations are happening and how we can join those up and sure all that sort of stuff i mean to be honest like what i've been saying to everyone firstly i wrote the article i had no idea whether or not it would take off in the way that it has so i'm still trying to like reconcile that in my own head and also think about what i know about activism and organizing and campaigning and like trying to take a step back and actually think about it less emotionally and impulsively and think about it in a more strategic way um another thing i'm really interested like every single day a new conversation happens on twitter about this issue or a new email arrives in my inbox from somebody being like what about this what can i do about this so i kind of want to keep the conversation going which is what i'm trying to do but also allow them to play out because i think that's a really important part of this and kind of seeing where it goes uh but in a very conscious way so staying on top of the conversations at least the ones that happen in the public sphere and having my own behind closed doors so the only kind of tangible next step that i can see is there's a group of people who um who want to name somebody and they have approached me and said this is what we want to do and we're trying to set up a call to talk about what who that is because i don't know yet i can do a list of potentials yeah but i don't know who they're talking about um and how we would go about doing that because they want to do it anonymously i'm not sure how we would do that um but it's not something i'm going to shy away from either like people would be like oh it's not helpful to name names they just need to be eradicated from our sector like i don't care if this destroys somebody's career like if they are a predator then they deserve that to happen to them and like that's the end of the conversation stage for me so i'm not concerned about that i'm concerned about the people who are doing the reporting and the people who are doing the naming that's my primary concern and also what will that change um let's say that we do name for example the person that you just mentioned um if like we need to think about okay what are we trying to achieve by doing that yeah um as long as we're having that part of the conversation and if the answer to that is he doesn't speak at conferences anymore he doesn't what like we need to really think about the next step because i don't want to blow something up for blowing something up's case like i really not learned my lesson but i had a really interesting experience i was heavily involved internally with lobbying senior management to do more uh because i was chairing the women's group and um it got to the point where they just weren't listening and weren't listening and weren't listening went on for like nine months or something and i felt like i was at this crossroads looking like okay do i leak this to the press or do i take one more go like try and do this in a constructive way and it was so hard like i remember going home to my boyfriend and being like how can i possibly do that but at the same time like this is getting so beyond a joke that if that's the only way to force change then i'll do it anyway decided to take the second option of like putting it through in a constructive way one more time went to the union did it that way the union put forward a list of demands and it all seemed like it was actually going to be taken seriously and then the following week somebody else leaked it to the press and nothing's happened since because it completely undermined all of the work and the demands of the union and of the work that i'd want to undermine the work that i'd gone on internally so i've seen that not work like that doesn't work in terms of creating change unless you've thought very carefully about what you're hoping to achieve on the other side and so i think we just have to be really aware of that we're having these conversations about naming and we need to approach everything in an ad hoc way as well because a lot of these people are independent consultants and they're not you know we can't go to their line manager or their ceo or whatever we need to look at each case and think okay where are the levers that we can pull to hold this person accountable", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.06, "end": 6.28, "text": " how are you today i'm all right
