{"text": " You know, when I went to South by Southwest, I thought a lot about that. I wondered, you know, where is the strategy and design in ITSM? Is it just about controlling those things, managing? Or can there actually be innovation brought through ITSM? And if so, why aren't there more ITSM people at conferences like South by Southwest? You know, we can't just focus on the management part. And I would like to personally explore that over the next year is to see, you know, what creative value can come out of pure ITSM? Or is it just management, you know? Yeah, I mean, I think we run into this a lot, actually. You know, we get into a client or whatever, you know, and they really don't know what they're doing. Or we see an RFP and they say, hey, we're doing ITIL or we're doing ITSM or hey, we bought this tool. Or the best, my favorite is when they say, we've owned this tool since 1990 and we haven't used it, right? And so we see these RFPs out there and we try to get to that point, right? What you just said there, Mark, strategy. What does the future look like to the services for your company? And, you know, a good CIO, you know, has that, you know, really it's part of the strategy, it's part of their objectives, right? But, you know, if the strategy is to get to this point, he needs to take this step and this step and this step to hit that point. And so, you know, when we do have people that want to speak that, have that discussion, we love it. But, you know, I think it's more rare because it's sort of like you can't lead a horse, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. It's more like, it's more powerful when it's self-realized. My wife studied this thing called cognitive coaching, where you basically are talking with people on a regular basis and, you know, through discussion, you give them points. You don't actually say, hey, this is what you need to do. You talk them through it until they come to the realization that that is what they need to do. It's an incredible way of sort of subconsciously getting people to realize what their true priorities should be. And it's a beautiful thing when it happens. I hope everyone's as lucky to be able to have those conversations. I think they're the most fun. Okay, so KPMG, I looked it up, stands for Keep Pimping My Goods. No? Keep Pimping My Goods. Thank you, Baron. Awesome. So Farah, can you talk a little bit about your experience? Like, how do you, do you find yourself leveraging your experience from Emory on a regular basis? Like, what value does your experience give you on a day-to-day basis? You know, I think when I, you know, I've had many Emory moments on my client site. I love that name, Emory moments. It's awesome. It's great because, you know, quite often, and this is a, it's been a pattern of mine. So I was, I started off as a consultant, then I moved into a practitioner role, then back into consulting, and then I came to Emory. And that was my longest into four years as a practitioner. And so, of course, you always refer to your most recent memories. And it's been, it's been interesting. So I really reach out to my experience at Emory to remind myself what the practitioner is feeling in their shoes. It's, you know, when I was at Emory in my first role before even Mark had come to Emory, we were inundated with a lot of roles. You know, I was the process manager and process owner for incident and for problem and for request and for access and all these things and suffered multiple personality disorder and was frustrated at some times. And then we, you know, got to expand our team and fix it and become a little bit more streamlined. But it's reminding myself, it brings me back to those memories because a lot of these client sites are facing the very same challenge. They have not enough people. They have a lot of things they want to get done. They're trying to move past operational excellence or even attempt at it. I mean, it's amazing how much potential there is to really influence change and bring about some more efficiencies. But I keep relying back to that experience I had at Emory to give them ideas of how to see the light at the end of the tunnel, what they can do on a day-to-day basis, as opposed to just that strategy and fluffy level that sometimes consultants like to draw a picture and tell them to figure out the rest out. But I've really been able to give them practical day-to-day, hey, this is what you could do every day to manage your incident process. Here are some meetings that you could, you know, create or instill. Here's a, you know, all sorts of artifacts, if you will, that now I like to use to leverage my experience at Emory to use to suggest to the clients, which has really helped. What about challenges you've maybe experienced based on, I mean, you're young. You know, you started your ITSM career young as well. You're young. You're a woman. You're fairly outspoken from my experience with you, which can be a good or a bad thing. You're, you know, you're not white. What are the things that have come about for you? That was awesome. You're from Pakistan, right Farah? Is that right? Pakistan? Well, my husband's from Pakistan. Yeah. Your husband's from Pakistan. Yeah. Yeah. So I was born in Canada, born and raised in Canada, but no one ever believed me. No, you said no, no, no, no, no. You said process. Everyone, everyone who listens to this podcast already knows that you're from Canada. That's true. Good catch. But so I grew up in a very small town. And so it's in growing up in that small town, I was literally the minority of the minority. I think I was the only East Indian descent person of East Indian descent in my school for all of elementary. So I was a little rough growing up. But going back to those times where I started off my career, by all means, an incredible challenge because I had multiple things working against me. I was a very, very ambitious young person, if you would put it that way. So I had my ITIL foundations by the time I was 19. I graduated high school with my CCNA because I was a part of a program that was trying to get high school students. You're part of a, you're part of a nerd commune. Okay, fine. I couldn't justify it any other way. But yeah, so I was, it was interesting. So I remember one of my old colleagues or managers even said to me that, you know what, good luck. It's going to be one of your toughest challenges because you're young, you're female, you are of a minority, and I really don't know how you're going to do this, but all the best. That's like, thanks for that vote of confidence. So I think it's better now. But by all means, especially even coming to Emory, it was all about remembering to, and I learned this from my dad, so I'm smiling now because I'm recalling his words. But he always said, remember that whenever you enter a room or wherever you enter an organization, a meeting, no matter whether it's for work, for personal, for volunteering, whether you're teaching dance to a kid, enter the room with a sense of humility. Because no matter what you have done in your life, no matter who you, you know, how many accomplishments you may have, you will always learn something from the others in the room. If you learn to listen and if you learn to observe. So doing and remembering those words, I think that has been really my way of breaking through many of the challenges. And I've had many from people telling me that, well, what do you know? From people who, when I walk into a room as their new ITIL Foundations instructor, within the next half an hour, I've all emailed the course coordinator to say, why is a high schooler teaching us about IT? I've had so many of those experiences. So I think it's about listening. It's about relating. And so I've had to work harder to gain the trust of the room, to gain that trust to say, hey, you know what? I have something to say. And it gave me a great perspective that I think can, and I should write about this more often. And I really haven't had time lately, but is the whole generation X versus generation Y. It is very difficult. And I think I understand that difficulty having worked with my dad very closely for the first part of my career, where it's understanding that the Gen X folks, they are an expert in their own right. They've been doing something for many, many years. They've sparked a whole bunch of stuff. And yeah, they may be old project managers that were part of the mainframe era as operators, but they know something. And they may be old school and they may have different tactics, but they're human. And when we come in and we are working at double or triple the pace that they used to, and we have ideas and our minds run at the speed of light in comparison, that's scary. Did you realize, Farah, this is the first time I've ever heard anyone say Gen X as being the old people? Busted. Wow. No, that's my problem. That's not your problem. No, that's what I'm saying. You got busted, Mark. I know. Wow. I'm sweating now. Oh my gosh. That's great to hear though. I like that approach of listening as opposed to asserting your abilities. I mean, sometimes sitting back is the way you do assert yourself, listening and relating, like you said. But what's interesting is even at the same time, so here, now we're getting enter Generation Z or what do you people, Z, as you would say in the US. Enter Generation Z or Z or what have you. And I've started to interface with associates and they're in their early 20s and they even have a completely different approach, right? Where if they're not challenged, then too bad. They'll walk out the door because they have 50 more opportunities lined up. Or if they don't like what they hear, I mean, and the things that bothered us don't bother them. They're not as worried even on the social space. Security is, what do you mean security? I share anything and everything anyway. So it's interesting because you see three, you know, in the workforce now, three completely different generations all coming together and it's kind of cool. Yeah, there's this guy, there's this guy, Toby something or other in the UK who's kind of burst onto the ITSM scene and he's like 22. He looks like he's 12. So I really want to connect with him and find out what his problem is, why in the world he got into ITSM. So we'll figure that out soon. When I was 19, I got into it because I had a big mouth. I kind of still do. The first guest to actually admit that they've got a big mouth. Awesome. Oh, that's great. Well, we're running out of time. Is there anything you wanted to leave us with, Farah? Any last words of wisdom? Because I know you have these gems that just come out of nowhere. Well, you know, I mean, in reflecting over the last six months, I kind of took the opportunity to do a little bit. And I know you and I had had this conversation before. I think all the people out there, the listeners, I'm sure a majority of you are consultants. I know a majority of you are. I mean, if you look at things like TFT13 and who was tweeting and who was excited, I think we need to, you know, for me personally, I take what I know as a privilege. And not everyone has that privilege. And if I want to be impactful, then I need to be serious about sharing. And it's not just sharing on the same space that we share. What I mean by sharing is sitting with those practitioners. Go to lunch with your customers. They're overwhelmed. They're overworked. They probably haven't had the training. So why not? I mean, I love to go to lunch with my clients and just sit there and listen and then give them these little gems, if you will, and encourage them to get onto social spaces to see the resources that are out there. And out of 20 people I've done that with in the six months, maybe one has probably checked out what I've said, but at least it's one more. And I really feel like as consultants, we are the army. We're the army behind ITSM and trying to help clear the battlefield so that these practitioners can grow. And I think we have a huge, huge responsibility that we don't always take as seriously as we could. That's awesome. I think, yeah, we talked about that and there was the idea that of every client job you have, finding one practitioner that you could activate into becoming social and getting out there and connecting with a larger community and helping bring back some of that into their own organization. I mean, what a great challenge for a consultant to have. You bet. And I think we should all, maybe it's like a little mission statement we all need to make for ourselves. I don't know. Love it. Keep giving. For the greater good. There we go. Hallelujah. All right. Thanks, Farah. Thank you very much, Farah. Thank you guys for having me. We'll talk to you soon. Farah is Satare21 is her handle. Reach out to her and we'll see you guys soon. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Mark. See you next week. All right. Bye, everybody. Bye. This was ITSM Weekly.

I wondered, you know, where is the strategy and design in ITSM? Is it just about controlling those things, managing? Or can there actually be innovation brought through ITSM? And if so, why aren't there more ITSM people at conferences like South by Southwest? You know, we can't just focus on the management part. And I would like to personally explore that over the next year is to see, you know, what creative value can come out of pure ITSM? Or is it just management, you know? Yeah, I mean, I think we run into this a lot, actually. You know, we get into a client or whatever, you know, and they really don't know what they're doing. Or we see an RFP and they say, hey, we're doing ITIL or we're doing ITSM or hey, we bought this tool. Or the best, my favorite is when they say, we've owned this tool since 1990 and we haven't used it, right? And so we see these RFPs out there and we try to get to that point, right? What you just said there, Mark, strategy. What does the future look like to the services for your company? And, you know, a good CIO, you know, has that, you know, really it's part of the strategy, it's part of their objectives, right? But, you know, if the strategy is to get to this point, he needs to take this step and this step and this step to hit that point. And so, you know, when we do have people that want to speak that, have that discussion, we love it. But, you know, I think it's more rare because it's sort of like you can't lead a horse, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. It's more like, it's more powerful when it's self-realized. My wife studied this thing called cognitive coaching, where you basically are talking with people on a regular basis and, you know, through discussion, you give them points. You don't actually say, hey, this is what you need to do. You talk them through it until they come to the realization that that is what they need to do. It's an incredible way of sort of subconsciously getting people to realize what their true priorities should be. And it's a beautiful thing when it happens. I hope everyone's as lucky to be able to have those conversations. I think they're the most fun. Okay, so KPMG, I looked it up, stands for Keep Pimping My Goods. No? Keep Pimping My Goods. Thank you, Baron. Awesome. So Farah, can you talk a little bit about your experience? Like, how do you, do you find yourself leveraging your experience from Emory on a regular basis? Like, what value does your experience give you on a day-to-day basis? You know, I think when I, you know, I've had many Emory moments on my client site. I love that name, Emory moments. It's awesome. It's great because, you know, quite often, and this is a, it's been a pattern of mine. So I was, I started off as a consultant, then I moved into a practitioner role, then back into consulting, and then I came to Emory. And that was my longest into four years as a practitioner. And so, of course, you always refer to your most recent memories. And it's been, it's been interesting. So I really reach out to my experience at Emory to remind myself what the practitioner is feeling in their shoes. It's, you know, when I was at Emory in my first role before even Mark had come to Emory, we were inundated with a lot of roles. You know, I was the process manager and process owner for incident and for problem and for request and for access and all these things and suffered multiple personality disorder and was frustrated at some times. And then we, you know, got to expand our team and fix it and become a little bit more streamlined. But it's reminding myself, it brings me back to those memories because a lot of these client sites are facing the very same challenge. They have not enough people. They have a lot of things they want to get done. They're trying to move past operational excellence or even attempt at it. I mean, it's amazing how much potential there is to really influence change and bring about some more efficiencies. But I keep relying back to that experience I had at Emory to give them ideas of how to see the light at the end of the tunnel, what they can do on a day-to-day basis, as opposed to just that strategy and fluffy level that sometimes consultants like to draw a picture and tell them to figure out the rest out. But I've really been able to give them practical day-to-day, hey, this is what you could do every day to manage your incident process. Here are some meetings that you could, you know, create or instill. Here's a, you know, all sorts of artifacts, if you will, that now I like to use to leverage my experience at Emory to use to suggest to the clients, which has really helped. What about challenges you've maybe experienced based on, I mean, you're young. You know, you started your ITSM career young as well. You're young. You're a woman. You're fairly outspoken from my experience with you, which can be a good or a bad thing. You're, you know, you're not white. What are the things that have come about for you? That was awesome. You're from Pakistan, right Farah? Is that right? Pakistan? Well, my husband's from Pakistan. Yeah. Your husband's from Pakistan. Yeah. Yeah. So I was born in Canada, born and raised in Canada, but no one ever believed me. No, you said no, no, no, no, no. You said process. Everyone, everyone who listens to this podcast already knows that you're from Canada. That's true. Good catch. But so I grew up in a very small town. And so it's in growing up in that small town, I was literally the minority of the minority. I think I was the only East Indian descent person of East Indian descent in my school for all of elementary. So I was a little rough growing up. But going back to those times where I started off my career, by all means, an incredible challenge because I had multiple things working against me. I was a very, very ambitious young person, if you would put it that way. So I had my ITIL foundations by the time I was 19. I graduated high school with my CCNA because I was a part of a program that was trying to get high school students. You're part of a, you're part of a nerd commune. Okay, fine. I couldn't justify it any other way. But yeah, so I was, it was interesting. So I remember one of my old colleagues or managers even said to me that, you know what, good luck. It's going to be one of your toughest challenges because you're young, you're female, you are of a minority, and I really don't know how you're going to do this, but all the best. That's like, thanks for that vote of confidence. So I think it's better now. But by all means, especially even coming to Emory, it was all about remembering to, and I learned this from my dad, so I'm smiling now because I'm recalling his words. But he always said, remember that whenever you enter a room or wherever you enter an organization, a meeting, no matter whether it's for work, for personal, for volunteering, whether you're teaching dance to a kid, enter the room with a sense of humility. Because no matter what you have done in your life, no matter who you, you know, how many accomplishments you may have, you will always learn something from the others in the room. If you learn to listen and if you learn to observe. So doing and remembering those words, I think that has been really my way of breaking through many of the challenges. And I've had many from people telling me that, well, what do you know? From people who, when I walk into a room as their new ITIL Foundations instructor, within the next half an hour, I've all emailed the course coordinator to say, why is a high schooler teaching us about IT? I've had so many of those experiences. So I think it's about listening. It's about relating. And so I've had to work harder to gain the trust of the room, to gain that trust to say, hey, you know what? I have something to say. And it gave me a great perspective that I think can, and I should write about this more often. And I really haven't had time lately, but is the whole generation X versus generation Y. It is very difficult. And I think I understand that difficulty having worked with my dad very closely for the first part of my career, where it's understanding that the Gen X folks, they are an expert in their own right. They've been doing something for many, many years. They've sparked a whole bunch of stuff. And yeah, they may be old project managers that were part of the mainframe era as operators, but they know something. And they may be old school and they may have different tactics, but they're human. And when we come in and we are working at double or triple the pace that they used to, and we have ideas and our minds run at the speed of light in comparison, that's scary. Did you realize, Farah, this is the first time I've ever heard anyone say Gen X as being the old people? Busted. Wow. No, that's my problem. That's not your problem. No, that's what I'm saying. You got busted, Mark. I know. Wow. I'm sweating now. Oh my gosh. That's great to hear though. I like that approach of listening as opposed to asserting your abilities. I mean, sometimes sitting back is the way you do assert yourself, listening and relating, like you said. But what's interesting is even at the same time, so here, now we're getting enter Generation Z or what do you people, Z, as you would say in the US. Enter Generation Z or Z or what have you. And I've started to interface with associates and they're in their early 20s and they even have a completely different approach, right? Where if they're not challenged, then too bad. They'll walk out the door because they have 50 more opportunities lined up. Or if they don't like what they hear, I mean, and the things that bothered us don't bother them. They're not as worried even on the social space. Security is, what do you mean security? I share anything and everything anyway. So it's interesting because you see three, you know, in the workforce now, three completely different generations all coming together and it's kind of cool. Yeah, there's this guy, there's this guy, Toby something or other in the UK who's kind of burst onto the ITSM scene and he's like 22. He looks like he's 12. So I really want to connect with him and find out what his problem is, why in the world he got into ITSM. So we'll figure that out soon. When I was 19, I got into it because I had a big mouth. I kind of still do. The first guest to actually admit that they've got a big mouth. Awesome. Oh, that's great. Well, we're running out of time. Is there anything you wanted to leave us with, Farah? Any last words of wisdom? Because I know you have these gems that just come out of nowhere. Well, you know, I mean, in reflecting over the last six months, I kind of took the opportunity to do a little bit. And I know you and I had had this conversation before. I think all the people out there, the listeners, I'm sure a majority of you are consultants. I know a majority of you are. I mean, if you look at things like TFT13 and who was tweeting and who was excited, I think we need to, you know, for me personally, I take what I know as a privilege. And not everyone has that privilege. And if I want to be impactful, then I need to be serious about sharing. And it's not just sharing on the same space that we share. What I mean by sharing is sitting with those practitioners. Go to lunch with your customers. They're overwhelmed. They're overworked. They probably haven't had the training. So why not? I mean, I love to go to lunch with my clients and just sit there and listen and then give them these little gems, if you will, and encourage them to get onto social spaces to see the resources that are out there. And out of 20 people I've done that with in the six months, maybe one has probably checked out what I've said, but at least it's one more. And I really feel like as consultants, we are the army. We're the army behind ITSM and trying to help clear the battlefield so that these practitioners can grow. And I think we have a huge, huge responsibility that we don't always take as seriously as we could. That's awesome. I think, yeah, we talked about that and there was the idea that of every client job you have, finding one practitioner that you could activate into becoming social and getting out there and connecting with a larger community and helping bring back some of that into their own organization. I mean, what a great challenge for a consultant to have. You bet. And I think we should all, maybe it's like a little mission statement we all need to make for ourselves. I don't know. Love it. Keep giving. For the greater good. There we go. Hallelujah. All right. Thanks, Farah. Thank you very much, Farah. Thank you guys for having me. We'll talk to you soon. Farah is Satare21 is her handle. Reach out to her and we'll see you guys soon. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Mark. See you next week. All right. Bye, everybody. Bye. This was ITSM Weekly.
