{"text": " She just, he keeps calling to apologize and apologize in different ways. And she keeps ignoring him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But what I like about it is he apologizes and ultimately, of course, on New Year's, he sort of has these, like, flashbacks where he's thinking about his friendship with Sally and how it's evolved and he realizes that he loves her. But it's never, like, explained. Like, he never has dialogue where he says, like, the reason I wasn't uncomfortable when we had sex was because so-and-so-and-so and I've changed my mind, blah-blah-blah. Like, it's not how, yeah. It's just left to the reality of, like, yeah, the characters are who they are. You know, follow along. Exactly. They expect the audience to understand who these people are. And left to Sally to understand how Harry is and why him telling her he loves her is such a big deal, even despite the fact that he did that before. Yeah, exactly. Oh, there is one thing that's not related to that. Okay. In the finale during, like, the New Year's party is that, like, you know, Sally's talking to some schmuck at the party. Mm-hmm. And, like, he makes some crappy joke. I mean, let me see the end of it so you don't really know what it is. Yeah, you don't get the joke is, yeah. And so he, like, starts laughing and she gets kind of caught for a second and then has to start, like, really over-the-top, like, forced laughing. Mm-hmm. And then she's leaning against a pillar and then she turns off camera and says, like, you know, I need to get out of here. And then the camera pans over to see Carrie Fisher on the other side of the pillar. It's like, you'll never get a cab in this hour. And then it pans back to her continuing the fake laugh. And then earlier on in the movie you get the scene where she's, like, dancing with a dude and he, like, dips her and she doesn't like it. Yeah. And she tells Marie, like, I can't believe you talked me into this, like, while they're on the dance floor. It's also staged pretty good. Yeah, that whole thing was really nice. I just love, like, that pan over and Carrie Fisher's just, like, very, like, calmly and very chill. Yeah. Like, you'll never get a cab at this hour. Like, I don't care. It's great. Like, I'm fine. Like, it's a really great little visual gag. It's like pan over, pan back. Yeah. Like, um. It's things like that that make the movie feel, like, light and fun. Yes. Yeah, even towards the finale when so many movies, not just romantic comedies, but movies in general, get, like, sort of heavier towards the finale. They fall out and get more, they get maudlin. Yeah. They do a good job of, like, not letting it get. Yeah, I mean, this is a movie that ends with a sweeping declaration of love that still doesn't feel maudlin. Yeah. Isn't that, like, so difficult to pull off? Yeah. Um, and I mean, to get to that part. Mm-hmm. One thing I think is great is that a cheaper movie, because, like, he shows up at the party, like, right before midnight. Yes. And, like, they're talking. I think you're going to talk about my favorite point. Go ahead. Right. So, like, the thing is, like, so there's, like, they show up right before midnight. There's a countdown. They, you know, they make they love each other and they kiss. And the thing is that the kiss is not, does not happen at midnight. Yeah, exactly. How great is it that midnight happens before they reconcile? Right. And it's, like, there's something to. I love that. And for starters, like, the simplest part of it just makes it seem like, yeah, they need to get to the new year, the next part to do that. Also, like, they need to have some dialogue over Auld Lang Syne. Well, that's true. Which would only play after midnight. Well, that's true. But I think the other part of it that I think is interesting is that when he comes in and he's, like, trying to get her to talk to him and she's trying to walk away and he's yelling after her, he kind of just, like, says, what about, you know, what if I love you? And she says, like, oh, come on. And he's, like, you know, what am I supposed to say to that? Maybe that you love me, too. Like, it's, like, this very, like, it's, like, the early stages of it. And that's happening during the countdown. And what happens when the countdown ends is that's when he starts his monologue about how, like, I love that you're cold even when it's 70 degrees. I love that you take 90 minutes to order a sandwich. Yeah. And so I feel like. Crinkle above your eye, yeah. The way that it's structured feels more like the countdown, you know, at the very least it makes it seem like, hey, we're not going to be overly precious about this moment and we're not going to, like, have them kiss right at midnight just for the fuck of it. But do you feel like it's counting down to his declaration? Yes, exactly. That's great. It feels like the countdown is to him finally letting his feelings out in, like, a non-bitter way. Right. Yeah, no, that's a really good point. And in response, her having to sort of, like, let go of her, like. I mean, she has a fantastic line where she says, you see, that's what I hate. You say these things and it makes it difficult for me to hate you. Yeah, it makes it impossible for me to hate you and I hate you, which is such a great. Yeah, the way she says, hey, I hate you, like, three times in a way that, like, slowly becomes, like, more like she's clearly saying I love you. Yeah, it's so fantastic. Which is a really great. Because I never, yeah, and then, you know, it's a really well-structured thing. And we'll say it's like 10 things I hate about you could have been inspired from that. Yeah. But it's not. It's obviously. But the thing is that, like, the way that it's all put together feels very, like, again, like, dozens and dozens of rom-coms have made sense then that have done variations on that same sort of ending. And done it much more trite. Yep. And structured and fake and plastic. And so then they go back to the original. More eye-roll worthy. Yeah. They went to the original and see it handled in that way that feels much more honest, emotionally honest. And it is structured in a much more intelligent way. Yeah. And I think there's reasons that it feels less trite than it would in other movies. And probably the biggest reason is, again, because we've spent so much time with this character that it doesn't feel like a generic declaration that anybody could have. Yes. First of all, the very things that he's saying we've seen throughout the movie. And we also know who Harry is as a character. And he's not somebody who in a million years would do something like this. Right. So that's probably the biggest part. But I also think, and this is something that I wish more rom-coms would, you know, be inspired by, is the casting here. Like we said, like, Billy Crystal is not a conventional romantic comedy lead. And he doesn't overact this scene. Yeah. You know, he has a very understated delivery throughout the entire movie. And you can tell the emotion here. I mean, it's there. But it's not over the top in the same way that another actor would do. Yeah. It's still sort of like dissonance that feels in character while still feeling like you know that it's an emotion for him. Yeah. And it's perfect. It's like, I remember reading an article once about how, like, casting directors took the wrong lesson from Friends. Maybe Tina Fey said this. Where, like, Friends told studio execs, like, hot people, like, always cast hot people. Hot people are great in sitcoms. But in reality, I think it's just Tina Fey. But in reality, like, most great sitcoms are cast by people you feel like you could see on the street. Yeah. Now, I don't think Billy Crystal is ugly. No, he isn't. He's like the movie star version of the common man. Yeah. Which is still, like, probably more attractive than somebody you'd see on the street. And Meg Ryan, of course, is beautiful. What? Thanks. Mm-mm. I'm just, I'm nothing. Are you kidding me? I am. But I'm just saying, like, in the context of this, like, because so many romantic comedies cast, I mean, good actors, don't get me wrong. And I don't mean to, like, you know, sweep everything with a broad brush. But the romantic comedies that we tend to criticize sort of feel like they cast on looks first. Or, like, have a type in mind. Yes. You know what I mean? Where it's, like, if you really, like, want to make a love story feel real, you cast people that feel and look real and have the right chemistry. Like, that's the thing, too, is that, to go back to the Friends example, like, the thing with that is that it's, like, again, it's not even that Friends did it wrong. Because, like, that cast did have great chemistry. It's just that that's not the lesson. Yeah, it's, like, the wrong lesson. The same way people take wrong lessons from this movie all the time. Right. In terms of, like, the structure of it. Like, you know, they take the structure and they don't take, like, the detail work and the actual emotional harnesses. They're not taking the parts that actually take hard work. Yes. But there's just something about it, and I'm trying to figure out the right way to make my point here, where it's sort of, like, even if you cast somebody who's, like, really good, who just feels like more of, like, a generic romantic comedy lead looks-wise. Like, even if, like, Chris Evans, who I think is a pretty good actor, if you cast him in When Harry Met Sally and he had that. Yeah, it would have felt a lot more fake. Exactly. Through no culpidism. Yeah, but because Billy Crystal is just somebody who's not generally, as an actor, a-roaming into comedy lead, it feels more real for that reason. Yeah, which is great. Yeah, for sure. And we're skipping over the best line in it, too, which is, I didn't come here, it's not because it's New Year's Eve and it's not because I'm lonely. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want to spend the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. We both butchered it. But it's just such a beautiful line, and it's such an emotional line, and you need a Billy Crystal to deliver it in a way that's a way that doesn't feel written. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's the thing. It's like, is he... I think there... I read some places that he actually came up with that line. I don't know if that's true or not. Yeah, I don't know. I would believe it, but I would also believe that Nora Ephron did, so who knows? I think that, yeah, you're right. I think he delivers that really well. It's like, again, it's like it's earnest, and it's like that and, like, the scene where he blows up after meeting, seeing his ex-wife. After seeing Helen, yeah. Like, those are the two scenes where he's really, like, out, you know? Most of the time he's, like, very, like, kind of, like, snarky and sardonic and sort of, like, low-key. Like, you know, those are, like, the two big moments where he lets out. That's why I don't see the George Costanza connection. No, no, no. I'm saying he's on the same continuum. He's definitely not. Like, the continuum is him to Larry David to George. Okay. But whatever. Like, the... But the point is that he... He has those two big moments, and you can tell, like, the depths of the emotion in either case. You have those two major moments, and so, like, that's the thing, is that because he hasn't played the role very big and broad and over the top, because he hasn't had very many, wow, aggressive moments in a positive or negative way, that for him to really go out there and just, like, be earnest and be really, like, like, direct about how he feels, you know, it has a clear impact. I agree. Because the whole point is that he's... He's not that guy. As angry as he is, he's not direct about that sort of thing. No, 100%. And I'm glad you brought up the scene where he sees Helen again, too, because it's just, you know... It's a good contrast. Yeah, and Billy Crystal, like, I also want to mention that he's good at this role. Yeah. Pretty... He's great. And, like, the camera sort of stays on him as he notices her before he explains it. Yeah, you see his face fall. Yeah, exactly. And he acts it really, really well. And you really feel that, like... Like, that scene is difficult for me to watch. I see. My favorite part of that scene is that, like, every time he says the guy's name, he says, Ira. Yeah. Like, they get a little bit of anger to it. Yeah. Like, they really, like, under... You know, it's like... Yeah, it's like... The names in this movie are great. Like, can you imagine being left by your wife for someone named Ira? I hope I don't have to... I hope I can only imagine that. Okay. I'll find somebody else, then. So weirdly passive-aggressive. I don't know any Iras. No, I just feel like making... So it's not a problem. I'm pretty sure... I'm making a joke. Unless I have an affair with somebody who's 70, I'm not going to leave you for an Ira. Yeah, it's very uncommon. Yeah. I'm... Yeah, I'm... I know. We're having fun. We're having fun. We kid. We kid, guys. Yeah, and then what's great about the other finale, too, is that the second after they, like, have, like, their, like, emotional, emotional reconciliation, like, you go straight back into, like, you know... I love it so much. It's like, what the hell does old man's sign mean? My whole life, I never know what this song means. Like... That feels like a sign for me. Yeah, that's a very sign for me. But the point is that, like, the song is about old friends. Yeah. Is the line that they go out on, which is so great. Yeah. And it's like... Like, they have that, like... I feel like the movie sort of has its cake and finds a way to have its cake and eat it, too. It's such a dumb expression. I mean, I get it, but it's just dumb. Because, like... It doesn't wallow too much in the emotions. It doesn't stay there too much. Yeah. So it has this really emotional beat, and then it pulls out and just sort of, like, makes, like, a funny, witty observation that is so much of this movie. So you get the emotion, but you also don't feel like a cheese ball. Yeah, but... Which I think is why so many people have an easy time loving this movie and saying they hate all the romantic comedies. Right. But here's the thing. I think there's two reasons for that. I think part of that is because, as you just pointed out, like, the witty observation is still relevant to the themes and the ideas. That's why it's so perfect. So it doesn't feel like a shallow, phony, like, ha-ha-like line. Yeah, exactly. But the other part of it, too, is that their whole relationship with the entire frickin' movie is built on that back-and-forth repartee. And so it just feels like, okay, great, we solved that problem. Now we can go back to the usual back-and-forth. Exactly. Well, like, it's sort of like... There's sort of an added... Forgive me for the indelicate phrasing, but it's like an unclogging, you know what I mean? Yeah. Where, like, after they had... After the question of sex became, like, in the foreground of the relationship, they couldn't talk like that anymore. And after they resolved it, like, no, we're a couple now. Go right back to talking the way they used to, which is awesome. Yeah. And again, it speaks to, like, the relationship that the movie's advocating for that you and I both love, that it's about, like, about having, like... That soulmate means, in a lot of ways, like, you're, you know... The person you talk to all the time. Well, I mean, I'm... Like, your conversational partner. Yes. Yeah, I mean... Spying partner, whatever you want to... Yeah. And again, like we've talked about before, like, a lot of that feels, like, born out of Nora Frenzler for, like, classic romantic movies. Like, it was about the desk set, which everyone should listen to our episode about. Yes. Guys, so very few of you listen to the desk set, and it's a really good movie. Or Sleep with Cincy Adel. Or You've Got Mail. Oh, well, now it just sounds like we... People don't listen to our podcast anymore. No, no, we've got plenty of other people... Quite a lot of you are super into Maine Manhattan. And 13 Going on 30. Yeah, which... Those are my suggestions. I know my audience. No, I know. But no, please listen to all of our episodes. God. But, um... We don't even sell ads. Like, what's... But, uh, yeah. I mean, it's... They do a really good job of establishing that as, like, their, you know, as the defining aspect of who they are. The spine of their relationship is just their ability to just, like, sit down and have a really long conversation. And I feel like everyone has at least one or two people like that in their lives. Like, you and I have a very busy time having a conversation. It's been that way since our first date, which is, like, one of the reasons, like, we knew we liked each other. It's why I think best... The friendships, the best friend characters are done so well here because it's a movie that values friendship more than... Yeah, I mean... Romantic or not. Yeah. Yeah, it's treated as, like, the essential component of all things. Which is... Yeah. You know, yeah. Which is beautiful. Mm-hmm. Um, so what a great vision of love. And I just sort of feel like why... That's why this is the ultimate romantic comedy in a way that sort of... Like, what you always say about Star Wars, Brendan, culturally inspired a lot, but, um, the thing that Star Wars does still kind of is unreplicated. Yes. Um, and that's the thing with When Harry Met Sally, it feels like, to me, like, like we said, like, culturally, people view this. People view 1989 and When Harry Met Sally as, like, the beginning of, like, the modern rom-com as we know it. And unfortunately, the rom-com that people... The rom-com formula that people don't like. People feel like it's born out of When Harry Met Sally. But When Harry Met Sally is a movie that's just, like, so laser-focused on, like, characters that you feel like you could know is not... Even with the romantic comedies that I love, it feels like they don't quite do that in the same way that When Harry Met Sally does. Um, and I guess it's just... It's just, um, this, like, incredible mix of, like, really good things happening at once. You've got a really great director who's friends with a screenwriter and, you know, the best screenwriter of romantic comedies of all time who's, like, she's good because she has this focus on characters and has this, like, really incredible wit. Yeah. Um, and you've got these, um, actors who are, like, really in their prime to be doing this. Yes. You know what I mean? It's all these things put together really sort of make this, um, romantic comedy that, like... I guess what I'm trying to say when I compare it to Star Wars is that, like, yeah, it's... It's influential, but in another way it sort of stands on its own. Yes. Like, in a china cabinet. Yeah. And it doesn't actually interact with any of these other things. Even, like we said, sleeping with other people, which is so heavily influenced by it. And the movie, by the way, that you and I both loved very much. Um, I feel like I liked it a tiny bit less than you, but I still thought it was wonderful. But it's not... It's not what Harry... Like, it doesn't... Like, this is a... It's, like, the word unique. You know what I mean? How you can't be very unique. Yes. Unique is just the idea that something is its own. Yeah. So when Harry Met Sally is the definition of unique for me, we're like, nothing will... Nothing will duplicate it. Yeah. Um, so that's faint phrase. Um... Do you have anything else to say? Uh, no. I think we... Let me just look through my notes just to see. I mean, we talked about the performances. We talked about the music. Yeah. Um, let me look through my straight notes here. I wrote down, nice shot of Billy Crystal ass in the car. Because at a certain point, he, like, bends over to find something in the back of the camera. Just, like, his ass is really just in the center of the screen. Yeah. It's like, I'm okay. Um... And that's the thing I was trying to say about how Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner are such good friends that it influenced the romantic friendship in the movie. Yeah. That's my point, is the movie just sort of values friendship, whether it's romantic and whether it's not. Like, it's almost not inter... Yeah. There's a certain point where it's not... Where, like, you know, whether it's in a romantic context or not, it's the same. Yeah. So it's like you can't draw on one to build the other. Yeah. Like, the movie's really about friendship more than it is about romance, which I guess is why it stands on its own and can't really interact with other romantic comedies in that way. Anyway, let's see. Um, incredible shots of New York. Oh, yeah. Here's a straight note. Um, watching this, it's really clear that men's fashion changes so much less than women's fashion over the years. Yeah. Because anything Billy Crystal is wearing throughout this movie, he could wear now. I probably have it in my closet. Yeah. Like... Like, these weird blown-out pants and, like, the shoulder pads, sweaters. Like, he changes from 77 at the beginning of the movie to, like... Like, they're clever about, like, placing her in clothing that feels, like, old school for the earlier scenes. But even, like, the modern scenes, like, no. It's... Like, it's just very obvious. I mean, she looks great. It's cool fashion, but it's not modern fashion, and it's more... Like, I always sort of have to adjust my eyes whenever she wears a new outfit, and I never have to do that for Harry. Yeah. Like, a voiceover thing. I mean, they actually literally do a voiceover with Harry at the very end. Yeah. He's just like, it's New Year's. It's not so bad. I'm meeting Malamar's. Yeah. Which is the first time they do, like, an internal voiceover. You know what I mean? Like, an internal monologue. Yeah, I guess. Like, they... But they do sort of have their phone conversations or have their conversations be voiceovers as we pull out and go through montages of their friendship. Right. And it includes, like, really great details. So, like, you see Harry a bunch of times opening the back of a book, including Misery at one point. Yes. And Ludlam. Directed by Rob Reiner. Yeah. He opens the back... He starts reading, and then he goes to the back of the book. Yeah. Because it's what he told Sally when they first met that he did. So, that way, if he dies, he knows how it ended. Yeah. That's how he proves that he's a dark person. Which is fucking bullshit, by the way, because, like, reading the final page of a novel means nothing. I know, but it's... No novel ends, like... But it's a distinctive character trait to have. I know, but it's just a shitty way to, like, solve that problem. No novel ends where, like, the first... Like, you read the first page and the last page, and you know... You understand what that ending means. Yeah, and even then, like, most stories have a denouement that, like, doesn't actually describe what the finale is. Exactly. But whatever. But still. It's still, like, the idea of, like, oh, I got to the last word. But anyway, so, you have, like, the shot. So, like, my favorite little bit is when she's opening the... When Sally's mailing letters, and Harry's with her, and she, like, does each letter individually. She closes it and checks it. She checks the envelope. Yeah, she checks the envelope. Yes. Then she puts it in, and she closes the lid, and she opens it again to make sure it went in. Then she closes it to check the next envelope. And she does that, like, three or four times, but she, like... Harry just grabs all the envelopes out of her hand and shoves them in the mailbox. Yeah. And slams it shut. It's fantastic. First of all, my brother does that, so it's always, like, an extra little funny thing to me, because my mom makes fun of him for it. Yeah. But also, like, that's something that's never, like, discussed, that she does. Like, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's not even... Like, the order... Like, they have shots of her, like, taking forever to order food, and the waiter and Harry, like, exchange a look, like, ugh. And they've talked about her taking a while to order and being very particular. Yeah, some things are discussed at length, and then... But that is one of, like, a weird... It's just, like, it just fits into her character. You get it, and you move on. And it's just a great visualization of, like, who these two characters are that I just love. And again, like, as dialogue-heavy as this is, the visuals really elevate it. Yeah, they've had a lot of weight in it. Yeah. Um... I still love that. Get over yourself for the pesto is the quiche of the 80s. Like, what does that mean? It's just...

"ori_dict": {"text": " She just, he keeps calling to apologize and apologize in different ways. And she keeps ignoring him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But what I like about it is he apologizes and ultimately, of course, on New Year's, he sort of has these, like, flashbacks where he's thinking about his friendship with Sally and how it's evolved and he realizes that he loves her. But it's never, like, explained. Like, he never has dialogue where he says, like, the reason I wasn't uncomfortable when we had sex was because so-and-so-and-so and I've changed my mind, blah-blah-blah. Like, it's not how, yeah. It's just left to the reality of, like, yeah, the characters are who they are. You know, follow along. Exactly. They expect the audience to understand who these people are. And left to Sally to understand how Harry is and why him telling her he loves her is such a big deal, even despite the fact that he did that before. Yeah, exactly. Oh, there is one thing that's not related to that. Okay. In the finale during, like, the New Year's party is that, like, you know, Sally's talking to some schmuck at the party. Mm-hmm. And, like, he makes some crappy joke. I mean, let me see the end of it so you don't really know what it is. Yeah, you don't get the joke is, yeah. And so he, like, starts laughing and she gets kind of caught for a second and then has to start, like, really over-the-top, like, forced laughing. Mm-hmm. And then she's leaning against a pillar and then she turns off camera and says, like, you know, I need to get out of here. And then the camera pans over to see Carrie Fisher on the other side of the pillar. It's like, you'll never get a cab in this hour. And then it pans back to her continuing the fake laugh. And then earlier on in the movie you get the scene where she's, like, dancing with a dude and he, like, dips her and she doesn't like it. Yeah. And she tells Marie, like, I can't believe you talked me into this, like, while they're on the dance floor. It's also staged pretty good. Yeah, that whole thing was really nice. I just love, like, that pan over and Carrie Fisher's just, like, very, like, calmly and very chill. Yeah. Like, you'll never get a cab at this hour. Like, I don't care. It's great. Like, I'm fine. Like, it's a really great little visual gag. It's like pan over, pan back. Yeah. Like, um. It's things like that that make the movie feel, like, light and fun. Yes. Yeah, even towards the finale when so many movies, not just romantic comedies, but movies in general, get, like, sort of heavier towards the finale. They fall out and get more, they get maudlin. Yeah. They do a good job of, like, not letting it get. Yeah, I mean, this is a movie that ends with a sweeping declaration of love that still doesn't feel maudlin. Yeah. Isn't that, like, so difficult to pull off? Yeah. Um, and I mean, to get to that part. Mm-hmm. One thing I think is great is that a cheaper movie, because, like, he shows up at the party, like, right before midnight. Yes. And, like, they're talking. I think you're going to talk about my favorite point. Go ahead. Right. So, like, the thing is, like, so there's, like, they show up right before midnight. There's a countdown. They, you know, they make they love each other and they kiss. And the thing is that the kiss is not, does not happen at midnight. Yeah, exactly. How great is it that midnight happens before they reconcile? Right. And it's, like, there's something to. I love that. And for starters, like, the simplest part of it just makes it seem like, yeah, they need to get to the new year, the next part to do that. Also, like, they need to have some dialogue over Auld Lang Syne. Well, that's true. Which would only play after midnight. Well, that's true. But I think the other part of it that I think is interesting is that when he comes in and he's, like, trying to get her to talk to him and she's trying to walk away and he's yelling after her, he kind of just, like, says, what about, you know, what if I love you? And she says, like, oh, come on. And he's, like, you know, what am I supposed to say to that? Maybe that you love me, too. Like, it's, like, this very, like, it's, like, the early stages of it. And that's happening during the countdown. And what happens when the countdown ends is that's when he starts his monologue about how, like, I love that you're cold even when it's 70 degrees. I love that you take 90 minutes to order a sandwich. Yeah. And so I feel like. Crinkle above your eye, yeah. The way that it's structured feels more like the countdown, you know, at the very least it makes it seem like, hey, we're not going to be overly precious about this moment and we're not going to, like, have them kiss right at midnight just for the fuck of it. But do you feel like it's counting down to his declaration? Yes, exactly. That's great. It feels like the countdown is to him finally letting his feelings out in, like, a non-bitter way. Right. Yeah, no, that's a really good point. And in response, her having to sort of, like, let go of her, like. I mean, she has a fantastic line where she says, you see, that's what I hate. You say these things and it makes it difficult for me to hate you. Yeah, it makes it impossible for me to hate you and I hate you, which is such a great. Yeah, the way she says, hey, I hate you, like, three times in a way that, like, slowly becomes, like, more like she's clearly saying I love you. Yeah, it's so fantastic. Which is a really great. Because I never, yeah, and then, you know, it's a really well-structured thing. And we'll say it's like 10 things I hate about you could have been inspired from that. Yeah. But it's not. It's obviously. But the thing is that, like, the way that it's all put together feels very, like, again, like, dozens and dozens of rom-coms have made sense then that have done variations on that same sort of ending. And done it much more trite. Yep. And structured and fake and plastic. And so then they go back to the original. More eye-roll worthy. Yeah. They went to the original and see it handled in that way that feels much more honest, emotionally honest. And it is structured in a much more intelligent way. Yeah. And I think there's reasons that it feels less trite than it would in other movies. And probably the biggest reason is, again, because we've spent so much time with this character that it doesn't feel like a generic declaration that anybody could have. Yes. First of all, the very things that he's saying we've seen throughout the movie. And we also know who Harry is as a character. And he's not somebody who in a million years would do something like this. Right. So that's probably the biggest part. But I also think, and this is something that I wish more rom-coms would, you know, be inspired by, is the casting here. Like we said, like, Billy Crystal is not a conventional romantic comedy lead. And he doesn't overact this scene. Yeah. You know, he has a very understated delivery throughout the entire movie. And you can tell the emotion here. I mean, it's there. But it's not over the top in the same way that another actor would do. Yeah. It's still sort of like dissonance that feels in character while still feeling like you know that it's an emotion for him. Yeah. And it's perfect. It's like, I remember reading an article once about how, like, casting directors took the wrong lesson from Friends. Maybe Tina Fey said this. Where, like, Friends told studio execs, like, hot people, like, always cast hot people. Hot people are great in sitcoms. But in reality, I think it's just Tina Fey. But in reality, like, most great sitcoms are cast by people you feel like you could see on the street. Yeah. Now, I don't think Billy Crystal is ugly. No, he isn't. He's like the movie star version of the common man. Yeah. Which is still, like, probably more attractive than somebody you'd see on the street. And Meg Ryan, of course, is beautiful. What? Thanks. Mm-mm. I'm just, I'm nothing. Are you kidding me? I am. But I'm just saying, like, in the context of this, like, because so many romantic comedies cast, I mean, good actors, don't get me wrong. And I don't mean to, like, you know, sweep everything with a broad brush. But the romantic comedies that we tend to criticize sort of feel like they cast on looks first. Or, like, have a type in mind. Yes. You know what I mean? Where it's, like, if you really, like, want to make a love story feel real, you cast people that feel and look real and have the right chemistry. Like, that's the thing, too, is that, to go back to the Friends example, like, the thing with that is that it's, like, again, it's not even that Friends did it wrong. Because, like, that cast did have great chemistry. It's just that that's not the lesson. Yeah, it's, like, the wrong lesson. The same way people take wrong lessons from this movie all the time. Right. In terms of, like, the structure of it. Like, you know, they take the structure and they don't take, like, the detail work and the actual emotional harnesses. They're not taking the parts that actually take hard work. Yes. But there's just something about it, and I'm trying to figure out the right way to make my point here, where it's sort of, like, even if you cast somebody who's, like, really good, who just feels like more of, like, a generic romantic comedy lead looks-wise. Like, even if, like, Chris Evans, who I think is a pretty good actor, if you cast him in When Harry Met Sally and he had that. Yeah, it would have felt a lot more fake. Exactly. Through no culpidism. Yeah, but because Billy Crystal is just somebody who's not generally, as an actor, a-roaming into comedy lead, it feels more real for that reason. Yeah, which is great. Yeah, for sure. And we're skipping over the best line in it, too, which is, I didn't come here, it's not because it's New Year's Eve and it's not because I'm lonely. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want to spend the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. We both butchered it. But it's just such a beautiful line, and it's such an emotional line, and you need a Billy Crystal to deliver it in a way that's a way that doesn't feel written. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's the thing. It's like, is he... I think there... I read some places that he actually came up with that line. I don't know if that's true or not. Yeah, I don't know. I would believe it, but I would also believe that Nora Ephron did, so who knows? I think that, yeah, you're right. I think he delivers that really well. It's like, again, it's like it's earnest, and it's like that and, like, the scene where he blows up after meeting, seeing his ex-wife. After seeing Helen, yeah. Like, those are the two scenes where he's really, like, out, you know? Most of the time he's, like, very, like, kind of, like, snarky and sardonic and sort of, like, low-key. Like, you know, those are, like, the two big moments where he lets out. That's why I don't see the George Costanza connection. No, no, no. I'm saying he's on the same continuum. He's definitely not. Like, the continuum is him to Larry David to George. Okay. But whatever. Like, the... But the point is that he... He has those two big moments, and you can tell, like, the depths of the emotion in either case. You have those two major moments, and so, like, that's the thing, is that because he hasn't played the role very big and broad and over the top, because he hasn't had very many, wow, aggressive moments in a positive or negative way, that for him to really go out there and just, like, be earnest and be really, like, like, direct about how he feels, you know, it has a clear impact. I agree. Because the whole point is that he's... He's not that guy. As angry as he is, he's not direct about that sort of thing. No, 100%. And I'm glad you brought up the scene where he sees Helen again, too, because it's just, you know... It's a good contrast. Yeah, and Billy Crystal, like, I also want to mention that he's good at this role. Yeah. Pretty... He's great. And, like, the camera sort of stays on him as he notices her before he explains it. Yeah, you see his face fall. Yeah, exactly. And he acts it really, really well. And you really feel that, like... Like, that scene is difficult for me to watch. I see. My favorite part of that scene is that, like, every time he says the guy's name, he says, Ira. Yeah. Like, they get a little bit of anger to it. Yeah. Like, they really, like, under... You know, it's like... Yeah, it's like... The names in this movie are great. Like, can you imagine being left by your wife for someone named Ira? I hope I don't have to... I hope I can only imagine that. Okay. I'll find somebody else, then. So weirdly passive-aggressive. I don't know any Iras. No, I just feel like making... So it's not a problem. I'm pretty sure... I'm making a joke. Unless I have an affair with somebody who's 70, I'm not going to leave you for an Ira. Yeah, it's very uncommon. Yeah. I'm... Yeah, I'm... I know. We're having fun. We're having fun. We kid. We kid, guys. Yeah, and then what's great about the other finale, too, is that the second after they, like, have, like, their, like, emotional, emotional reconciliation, like, you go straight back into, like, you know... I love it so much. It's like, what the hell does old man's sign mean? My whole life, I never know what this song means. Like... That feels like a sign for me. Yeah, that's a very sign for me. But the point is that, like, the song is about old friends. Yeah. Is the line that they go out on, which is so great. Yeah. And it's like... Like, they have that, like... I feel like the movie sort of has its cake and finds a way to have its cake and eat it, too. It's such a dumb expression. I mean, I get it, but it's just dumb. Because, like... It doesn't wallow too much in the emotions. It doesn't stay there too much. Yeah. So it has this really emotional beat, and then it pulls out and just sort of, like, makes, like, a funny, witty observation that is so much of this movie. So you get the emotion, but you also don't feel like a cheese ball. Yeah, but... Which I think is why so many people have an easy time loving this movie and saying they hate all the romantic comedies. Right. But here's the thing. I think there's two reasons for that. I think part of that is because, as you just pointed out, like, the witty observation is still relevant to the themes and the ideas. That's why it's so perfect. So it doesn't feel like a shallow, phony, like, ha-ha-like line. Yeah, exactly. But the other part of it, too, is that their whole relationship with the entire frickin' movie is built on that back-and-forth repartee. And so it just feels like, okay, great, we solved that problem. Now we can go back to the usual back-and-forth. Exactly. Well, like, it's sort of like... There's sort of an added... Forgive me for the indelicate phrasing, but it's like an unclogging, you know what I mean? Yeah. Where, like, after they had... After the question of sex became, like, in the foreground of the relationship, they couldn't talk like that anymore. And after they resolved it, like, no, we're a couple now. Go right back to talking the way they used to, which is awesome. Yeah. And again, it speaks to, like, the relationship that the movie's advocating for that you and I both love, that it's about, like, about having, like... That soulmate means, in a lot of ways, like, you're, you know... The person you talk to all the time. Well, I mean, I'm... Like, your conversational partner. Yes. Yeah, I mean... Spying partner, whatever you want to... Yeah. And again, like we've talked about before, like, a lot of that feels, like, born out of Nora Frenzler for, like, classic romantic movies. Like, it was about the desk set, which everyone should listen to our episode about. Yes. Guys, so very few of you listen to the desk set, and it's a really good movie. Or Sleep with Cincy Adel. Or You've Got Mail. Oh, well, now it just sounds like we... People don't listen to our podcast anymore. No, no, we've got plenty of other people... Quite a lot of you are super into Maine Manhattan. And 13 Going on 30. Yeah, which... Those are my suggestions. I know my audience. No, I know. But no, please listen to all of our episodes. God. But, um... We don't even sell ads. Like, what's... But, uh, yeah. I mean, it's... They do a really good job of establishing that as, like, their, you know, as the defining aspect of who they are. The spine of their relationship is just their ability to just, like, sit down and have a really long conversation. And I feel like everyone has at least one or two people like that in their lives. Like, you and I have a very busy time having a conversation. It's been that way since our first date, which is, like, one of the reasons, like, we knew we liked each other. It's why I think best... The friendships, the best friend characters are done so well here because it's a movie that values friendship more than... Yeah, I mean... Romantic or not. Yeah. Yeah, it's treated as, like, the essential component of all things. Which is... Yeah. You know, yeah. Which is beautiful. Mm-hmm. Um, so what a great vision of love. And I just sort of feel like why... That's why this is the ultimate romantic comedy in a way that sort of... Like, what you always say about Star Wars, Brendan, culturally inspired a lot, but, um, the thing that Star Wars does still kind of is unreplicated. Yes. Um, and that's the thing with When Harry Met Sally, it feels like, to me, like, like we said, like, culturally, people view this. People view 1989 and When Harry Met Sally as, like, the beginning of, like, the modern rom-com as we know it. And unfortunately, the rom-com that people... The rom-com formula that people don't like. People feel like it's born out of When Harry Met Sally. But When Harry Met Sally is a movie that's just, like, so laser-focused on, like, characters that you feel like you could know is not... Even with the romantic comedies that I love, it feels like they don't quite do that in the same way that When Harry Met Sally does. Um, and I guess it's just... It's just, um, this, like, incredible mix of, like, really good things happening at once. You've got a really great director who's friends with a screenwriter and, you know, the best screenwriter of romantic comedies of all time who's, like, she's good because she has this focus on characters and has this, like, really incredible wit. Yeah. Um, and you've got these, um, actors who are, like, really in their prime to be doing this. Yes. You know what I mean? It's all these things put together really sort of make this, um, romantic comedy that, like... I guess what I'm trying to say when I compare it to Star Wars is that, like, yeah, it's... It's influential, but in another way it sort of stands on its own. Yes. Like, in a china cabinet. Yeah. And it doesn't actually interact with any of these other things. Even, like we said, sleeping with other people, which is so heavily influenced by it. And the movie, by the way, that you and I both loved very much. Um, I feel like I liked it a tiny bit less than you, but I still thought it was wonderful. But it's not... It's not what Harry... Like, it doesn't... Like, this is a... It's, like, the word unique. You know what I mean? How you can't be very unique. Yes. Unique is just the idea that something is its own. Yeah. So when Harry Met Sally is the definition of unique for me, we're like, nothing will... Nothing will duplicate it. Yeah. Um, so that's faint phrase. Um... Do you have anything else to say? Uh, no. I think we... Let me just look through my notes just to see. I mean, we talked about the performances. We talked about the music. Yeah. Um, let me look through my straight notes here. I wrote down, nice shot of Billy Crystal ass in the car. Because at a certain point, he, like, bends over to find something in the back of the camera. Just, like, his ass is really just in the center of the screen. Yeah. It's like, I'm okay. Um... And that's the thing I was trying to say about how Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner are such good friends that it influenced the romantic friendship in the movie. Yeah. That's my point, is the movie just sort of values friendship, whether it's romantic and whether it's not. Like, it's almost not inter... Yeah. There's a certain point where it's not... Where, like, you know, whether it's in a romantic context or not, it's the same. Yeah. So it's like you can't draw on one to build the other. Yeah. Like, the movie's really about friendship more than it is about romance, which I guess is why it stands on its own and can't really interact with other romantic comedies in that way. Anyway, let's see. Um, incredible shots of New York. Oh, yeah. Here's a straight note. Um, watching this, it's really clear that men's fashion changes so much less than women's fashion over the years. Yeah. Because anything Billy Crystal is wearing throughout this movie, he could wear now. I probably have it in my closet. Yeah. Like... Like, these weird blown-out pants and, like, the shoulder pads, sweaters. Like, he changes from 77 at the beginning of the movie to, like... Like, they're clever about, like, placing her in clothing that feels, like, old school for the earlier scenes. But even, like, the modern scenes, like, no. It's... Like, it's just very obvious. I mean, she looks great. It's cool fashion, but it's not modern fashion, and it's more... Like, I always sort of have to adjust my eyes whenever she wears a new outfit, and I never have to do that for Harry. Yeah. Like, a voiceover thing. I mean, they actually literally do a voiceover with Harry at the very end. Yeah. He's just like, it's New Year's. It's not so bad. I'm meeting Malamar's. Yeah. Which is the first time they do, like, an internal voiceover. You know what I mean? Like, an internal monologue. Yeah, I guess. Like, they... But they do sort of have their phone conversations or have their conversations be voiceovers as we pull out and go through montages of their friendship. Right. And it includes, like, really great details. So, like, you see Harry a bunch of times opening the back of a book, including Misery at one point. Yes. And Ludlam. Directed by Rob Reiner. Yeah. He opens the back... He starts reading, and then he goes to the back of the book. Yeah. Because it's what he told Sally when they first met that he did. So, that way, if he dies, he knows how it ended. Yeah. That's how he proves that he's a dark person. Which is fucking bullshit, by the way, because, like, reading the final page of a novel means nothing. I know, but it's... No novel ends, like... But it's a distinctive character trait to have. I know, but it's just a shitty way to, like, solve that problem. No novel ends where, like, the first... Like, you read the first page and the last page, and you know... You understand what that ending means. Yeah, and even then, like, most stories have a denouement that, like, doesn't actually describe what the finale is. Exactly. But whatever. But still. It's still, like, the idea of, like, oh, I got to the last word. But anyway, so, you have, like, the shot. So, like, my favorite little bit is when she's opening the... When Sally's mailing letters, and Harry's with her, and she, like, does each letter individually. She closes it and checks it. She checks the envelope. Yeah, she checks the envelope. Yes. Then she puts it in, and she closes the lid, and she opens it again to make sure it went in. Then she closes it to check the next envelope. And she does that, like, three or four times, but she, like... Harry just grabs all the envelopes out of her hand and shoves them in the mailbox. Yeah. And slams it shut. It's fantastic. First of all, my brother does that, so it's always, like, an extra little funny thing to me, because my mom makes fun of him for it. Yeah. But also, like, that's something that's never, like, discussed, that she does. Like, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's not even... Like, the order... Like, they have shots of her, like, taking forever to order food, and the waiter and Harry, like, exchange a look, like, ugh. And they've talked about her taking a while to order and being very particular. Yeah, some things are discussed at length, and then... But that is one of, like, a weird... It's just, like, it just fits into her character. You get it, and you move on. And it's just a great visualization of, like, who these two characters are that I just love. And again, like, as dialogue-heavy as this is, the visuals really elevate it. Yeah, they've had a lot of weight in it. Yeah. Um... I still love that. Get over yourself for the pesto is the quiche of the 80s. Like, what does that mean? It's just...
