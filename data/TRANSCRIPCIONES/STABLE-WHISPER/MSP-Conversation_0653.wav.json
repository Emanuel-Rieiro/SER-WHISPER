{"text": " basic minimal health care that is slowing down the rates of premiums rising, that has people covered, some of them for the very first time in their entire lives, that that program is a disaster. Yeah, it's a disaster, isn't it? It's all a matter of perspective. That's it. Life is just a matter of perspective. It's a disaster if you're a sociopath who likes when Americans are sick and dying. That's a disaster. Oh, my God. Americans are getting health care. They're not afraid to go to a doctor, that they actually have to be treated. They can't get kicked off when they get sick, when they get a terrifying diagnosis. You mean the insurance company can no longer go through their medical records and find some kind of something that doesn't match? Let's say they didn't put down that they had acne on their back when they were 18. They took Accutane and they get kicked off. Oh, that is a disaster. You mean Americans have more power? You mean corporations have to treat them as something other than just a host from which to suck profit and discard? Oh, my God. What a disaster. It is a disaster. If you're a sociopath, if you hate America, if you hate Americans, I don't get it. I don't understand. Like I always say, these people, they're shoving pureed peas up the asses of detained, illegally detained prisoners in Guantanamo. They're all about that. They want to do that because it saves American lives. But if you are sick, but this doesn't though, right? Even though it does, even though we know it does, and we have the statistics to prove it. But there you go. They're not working for us. And how the hell did we get here? How did we get here? How are they in power? I mean, I'm still in power. I'm still in shock and denial. They rigged the game. There's more of us. Do not even question it. First of all, not only did Hillary Clinton win more votes, we know that for a fact, but they, the Republicans, they gerrymandered their districts and they pushed people off the rolls with, there's more of us that actually then got a chance to vote. And there's also a lot of people too. And that's a problem. What we need to do is fight for, we need to fight for automatic voter registration. We should make, actually I heard somebody who's talking about this on Tom Hartman show that we should make in the blue States, we should really start moving forward with, with different things like making voting mandatory and do like, if we do them in the blue States of New York and California does it. And, then the, the, the, the difference between the red States and the blue States will become so, so wide that the, it's either they're going to, they're going to either get left behind completely where to the point where it doesn't even matter or they'll, they'll get on board, but we need to show such a wide contrast. I wish, I don't know if it's possible. I, I truthfully, I wish that I, that, New York, I'm in New York, California, other blue States. I wish that we could form some kind of single payer system, but I guess that would require some kind of federal funding. And who knows? I don't know. I do not know. And anyway, so I, this, this Paul Ryan, who I hate, let's just get that out there. He's a liar. We know that he lied. Not only did he lie to our faces, he lied to the face of this cancer man, the man who, who has had cancer at 49. Now he, he, uh, says he wanted to thank president Obama publicly, uh, because the affordable care act saved his life. And how many more are there out there? And, um, people are complaining about their premiums. I got somebody tweeted me on, you know, on Twitter. I wonder where else they tweet you, but whatever. Uh, they telling me, Oh, my premium was $200 before the ACA. Now it's 500 first. And this is the old guy. You know, I looked at his picture. He ain't no spring chicken. And I'm like, Oh, well you should have no problem. A healthy young lad like you should have no problem getting insurance from the pay or die racket. They'll, they'll be clamoring. They'll be beating themselves a new path to your door. They'll be tripping over each other, trying to insure an old dude like you, you sucker. The fact is it's a people, Oh, their insurance went up. Well, you know what? Maybe back then the, when you were paying 200, you were paying basically for the privilege of having an insurance card in your pocket that didn't pay anything when you actually needed it. And when you needed it, they could kick you off. And when you needed it, they could say, Oh, well sucks to be you. Oh God. I'm so, isn't it exhausting? We could be moving forward. We could be doing things in this country. We could be at like going to the moon, not to the moon. Let's say going to Mars. We went to the moon. Let's go to the moon again. Screw it. Why can't we do something? We could be exploring the, uh, uh, the, the, uh, oceans or cleaning up the oceans. Let's try that. We could be, trying to cure cancer, curing all kinds of diseases. We could be coming up with amazing inventions and innovations, but instead where you have to fight this battle again, let's keep fighting the same battle. Why don't we just keep fighting this battle over and over? I mean, I feel like I'm in frigging groundhog day. It's so irritating. Can I, can I add something, um, to the conversation? If you don't mind, I, I know I'm your executive producer. And, um, uh, and all, but I, I just wanted to throw in, I actually have a preexisting condition since birth. Um, I was born with a congenital heart defect. So, um, the ACA has given me new life and I'm one of those people that you're talking about and that Paul Ryan wants to screw and the rest of the Republicans want to screw. And, um, if they're telling you otherwise that they're not going to, uh, our friend Matthias who hosts, uh, uh, another show on FYI nation, uh, and is a contributor for some say, explain that they cannot get rid of the mandates without, uh, and keep the, um, the, um, the part where you have to, keep everybody enrolled without the mandates. Otherwise the bottom will fall out from the insurance company. Of course. They need the mandates. That's what they hate. But that's the thing. You have to have it. Otherwise what the, it's only sick people will get into the system. It's not, they understand that Sherry, my writing partner and comedy partner on, it sucks to be right. This six minute segment that we do, she lives in Switzerland and she's living there. Teaching theater to, because she has to get health insurance, has to get healthcare. Switzerland has Obamacare. It is functioning the way Obamacare is supposed to function, except it's facilitated by nonprofit companies. So we're the only nation on earth that has for profit healthcare. And these, it's just, I cannot stand Republicans. They talk about, they say we have the best system in the world. We do not have the best system in the world. Fact is we have the best anything in the world. If you are rich, if you are rich, you have the best anything. And that's, that's the truth. So, but, but thank you for that. But you know, you don't have to tell me I'm right. I know I'm right. Break it when I'm wrong. Okay. Gotcha. Boss. But to say that for profit healthcare is the best in the world, when we have the math and the experience to prove otherwise, it says that once again, what they're saying is money is the only worthy American value left fighting for. That's it. That's all we do. That's all it is. Forget it. Forget curing. You know, uh, Joan, Jonas Salk, when he, when he invented the polio vaccine that was given out for free for it to everybody was vaccinated. They eradicated polio. And he was asked by Edward R. Murrow, how come you didn't patent this? And his response was, how can you patent the sun?", "segments": [{"start": 0.18, "end": 6.18, "text": " basic minimal health care that is slowing down the rates of premiums rising,", "seek": 0.0,

premiums rising, that has people covered, some of them for the very first time in their entire lives, that that program is a disaster. Yeah, it's a disaster, isn't it? It's all a matter of perspective. That's it. Life is just a matter of perspective. It's a disaster if you're a sociopath who likes when Americans are sick and dying. That's a disaster. Oh, my God. Americans are getting health care. They're not afraid to go to a doctor, that they actually have to be treated. They can't get kicked off when they get sick, when they get a terrifying diagnosis. You mean the insurance company can no longer go through their medical records and find some kind of something that doesn't match? Let's say they didn't put down that they had acne on their back when they were 18. They took Accutane and they get kicked off. Oh, that is a disaster. You mean Americans have more power? You mean corporations have to treat them as something other than just a host from which to suck profit and discard? Oh, my God. What a disaster. It is a disaster. If you're a sociopath, if you hate America, if you hate Americans, I don't get it. I don't understand. Like I always say, these people, they're shoving pureed peas up the asses of detained, illegally detained prisoners in Guantanamo. They're all about that. They want to do that because it saves American lives. But if you are sick, but this doesn't though, right? Even though it does, even though we know it does, and we have the statistics to prove it. But there you go. They're not working for us. And how the hell did we get here? How did we get here? How are they in power? I mean, I'm still in power. I'm still in shock and denial. They rigged the game. There's more of us. Do not even question it. First of all, not only did Hillary Clinton win more votes, we know that for a fact, but they, the Republicans, they gerrymandered their districts and they pushed people off the rolls with, there's more of us that actually then got a chance to vote. And there's also a lot of people too. And that's a problem. What we need to do is fight for, we need to fight for automatic voter registration. We should make, actually I heard somebody who's talking about this on Tom Hartman show that we should make in the blue States, we should really start moving forward with, with different things like making voting mandatory and do like, if we do them in the blue States of New York and California does it. And, then the, the, the, the difference between the red States and the blue States will become so, so wide that the, it's either they're going to, they're going to either get left behind completely where to the point where it doesn't even matter or they'll, they'll get on board, but we need to show such a wide contrast. I wish, I don't know if it's possible. I, I truthfully, I wish that I, that, New York, I'm in New York, California, other blue States. I wish that we could form some kind of single payer system, but I guess that would require some kind of federal funding. And who knows? I don't know. I do not know. And anyway, so I, this, this Paul Ryan, who I hate, let's just get that out there. He's a liar. We know that he lied. Not only did he lie to our faces, he lied to the face of this cancer man, the man who, who has had cancer at 49. Now he, he, uh, says he wanted to thank president Obama publicly, uh, because the affordable care act saved his life. And how many more are there out there? And, um, people are complaining about their premiums. I got somebody tweeted me on, you know, on Twitter. I wonder where else they tweet you, but whatever. Uh, they telling me, Oh, my premium was $200 before the ACA. Now it's 500 first. And this is the old guy. You know, I looked at his picture. He ain't no spring chicken. And I'm like, Oh, well you should have no problem. A healthy young lad like you should have no problem getting insurance from the pay or die racket. They'll, they'll be clamoring. They'll be beating themselves a new path to your door. They'll be tripping over each other, trying to insure an old dude like you, you sucker. The fact is it's a people, Oh, their insurance went up. Well, you know what? Maybe back then the, when you were paying 200, you were paying basically for the privilege of having an insurance card in your pocket that didn't pay anything when you actually needed it. And when you needed it, they could kick you off. And when you needed it, they could say, Oh, well sucks to be you. Oh God. I'm so, isn't it exhausting? We could be moving forward. We could be doing things in this country. We could be at like going to the moon, not to the moon. Let's say going to Mars. We went to the moon. Let's go to the moon again. Screw it. Why can't we do something? We could be exploring the, uh, uh, the, the, uh, oceans or cleaning up the oceans. Let's try that. We could be, trying to cure cancer, curing all kinds of diseases. We could be coming up with amazing inventions and innovations, but instead where you have to fight this battle again, let's keep fighting the same battle. Why don't we just keep fighting this battle over and over? I mean, I feel like I'm in frigging groundhog day. It's so irritating. Can I, can I add something, um, to the conversation? If you don't mind, I, I know I'm your executive producer. And, um, uh, and all, but I, I just wanted to throw in, I actually have a preexisting condition since birth. Um, I was born with a congenital heart defect. So, um, the ACA has given me new life and I'm one of those people that you're talking about and that Paul Ryan wants to screw and the rest of the Republicans want to screw. And, um, if they're telling you otherwise that they're not going to, uh, our friend Matthias who hosts, uh, uh, another show on FYI nation, uh, and is a contributor for some say, explain that they cannot get rid of the mandates without, uh, and keep the, um, the, um, the part where you have to, keep everybody enrolled without the mandates. Otherwise the bottom will fall out from the insurance company. Of course. They need the mandates. That's what they hate. But that's the thing. You have to have it. Otherwise what the, it's only sick people will get into the system. It's not, they understand that Sherry, my writing partner and comedy partner on, it sucks to be right. This six minute segment that we do, she lives in Switzerland and she's living there. Teaching theater to, because she has to get health insurance, has to get healthcare. Switzerland has Obamacare. It is functioning the way Obamacare is supposed to function, except it's facilitated by nonprofit companies. So we're the only nation on earth that has for profit healthcare. And these, it's just, I cannot stand Republicans. They talk about, they say we have the best system in the world. We do not have the best system in the world. Fact is we have the best anything in the world. If you are rich, if you are rich, you have the best anything. And that's, that's the truth. So, but, but thank you for that. But you know, you don't have to tell me I'm right. I know I'm right. Break it when I'm wrong. Okay. Gotcha. Boss. But to say that for profit healthcare is the best in the world, when we have the math and the experience to prove otherwise, it says that once again, what they're saying is money is the only worthy American value left fighting for. That's it. That's all we do. That's all it is. Forget it. Forget curing. You know, uh, Joan, Jonas Salk, when he, when he invented the polio vaccine that was given out for free for it to everybody was vaccinated. They eradicated polio. And he was asked by Edward R. Murrow, how come you didn't patent this? And his response was, how can you patent the sun?", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.18, "end": 8.56, "text": " basic minimal health care that is slowing down the rates of premiums rising, that has people", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [3875, 13206, 1585, 1127, 300, 307, 26958, 760, 264, 6846, 295, 12049, 82, 11636, 11, 300, 575, 561], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.045442685689011664, "compression_ratio": 1.530054644808743, "no_speech_prob": 0.016653047874569893, "words": [{"word": " basic", "start": 0.18, "end": 0.6, "probability": 0.740966796875, "tokens": [3875]}, {"word": " minimal", "start": 0.6, "end": 1.14, "probability": 0.9713989496231079, "tokens": [13206]}, {"word": " health", "start": 1.14, "end": 1.56, "probability": 0.7306606769561768, "tokens": [1585]}, {"word": " care", "start": 1.56, "end": 1.82, "probability": 0.9998021721839905, "tokens": [1127]}, {"word": " that", "start": 1.82, "end": 2.14, "probability": 0.900714099407196, "tokens": [300]}, {"word": " is", "start": 2.14, "end": 2.46, "probability": 0.9998661279678345, "tokens": [307]}, {"word": " slowing", "start": 2.46, "end": 3.4, "probability": 0.9997052550315857, "tokens": [26958]}, {"word": " down", "start": 3.4, "end": 3.8, "probability": 0.9999567270278931, "tokens": [760]}, {"word": " the", "start": 3.8, "end": 4.24, "probability": 0.9997790455818176, "tokens": [264]}, {"word": " rates", "start": 4.24, "end": 4.72, "probability": 0.9996401071548462, "tokens": [6846]}, {"word": " of", "start": 5.0, "end": 5.1, "probability": 0.9998894929885864, "tokens": [295]}, {"word": " premiums", "start": 5.1, "end": 5.68, "probability": 0.9981600344181061, "tokens": [12049, 82]}, {"word": " rising,", "start": 5.68, "end": 6.18, "probability": 0.9977895021438599, "tokens": [11636, 11]}, {"word": " that", "start": 6.54, "end": 7.1, "probability": 0.9996505975723267, "tokens": [300]}, {"word": " has", "start": 7.98, "end": 8.08, "probability": 0.9998435974121094, "tokens": [575]}, {"word": " people", "start": 8.08, "end": 8.56, "probability": 0.9998579025268555, "tokens": [561]}]}, {"id": 1, "start": 8.56, "end": 16.98, "text": " covered, some of them for the very first time in their entire lives, that that program is a", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [5343, 11, 512, 295, 552, 337, 264, 588, 700, 565, 294, 641, 2302, 2909, 11, 300, 300, 1461, 307, 257], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.045442685689011664, "compression_ratio": 1.530054644808743, "no_speech_prob": 0.016653047874569893, "words": [{"word": " covered,", "start": 8.56, "end": 9.18, "probability": 0.9997435212135315, "tokens": [5343, 11]}, {"word": " some", "start": 9.92, "end": 10.02, "probability": 0.9996974468231201, "tokens": [512]}, {"word": " of", "start": 10.02, "end": 10.22, "probability": 0.99997878074646, "tokens": [295]}, {"word": " them", "start": 10.22, "end": 10.5, "probability": 0.9999551773071289, "tokens": [552]}, {"word": " for", "start": 10.5, "end": 10.9, "probability": 0.9819566011428833, "tokens": [337]}, {"word": " the", "start": 10.9, "end": 11.12, "probability": 0.9999290704727173, "tokens": [264]}, {"word": " very", "start": 11.12, "end": 11.36, "probability": 0.9989767074584961, "tokens": [588]}, {"word": " first", "start": 11.36, "end": 11.7, "probability": 0.9999741315841675, "tokens": [700]}, {"word": " time", "start": 11.7, "end": 12.32, "probability": 0.9999938011169434, "tokens": [565]}, {"word": " in", "start": 12.32, "end": 12.6, "probability": 0.9983489513397217, "tokens": [294]}, {"word": " their", "start": 12.96, "end": 13.12, "probability": 0.9999862909317017, "tokens": [641]}, {"word": " entire", "start": 13.12, "end": 13.38, "probability": 0.9997474551200867, "tokens": [2302]}, {"word": " lives,", "start": 13.38, "end": 14.04, "probability": 0.9999786615371704, "tokens": [2909, 11]}, {"word": " that", "start": 15.12, "end": 15.22, "probability": 0.999896764755249, "tokens": [300]}, {"word": " that", "start": 15.22, "end": 15.62, "probability": 0.9957348704338074, "tokens": [300]}, {"word": " program", "start": 15.62, "end": 16.26, "probability": 0.9994913339614868, "tokens": [1461]}, {"word": " is", "start": 16.26, "end": 16.8, "probability": 0.9999845027923584, "tokens": [307]}, {"word": " a", "start": 16.8, "end": 16.98, "probability": 0.9999740123748779, "tokens": [257]}]}, {"id": 2, "start": 16.98, "end": 23.38, "text": " disaster.
