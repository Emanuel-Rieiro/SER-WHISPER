{"text": " late last year, a student got shot and died. He was a post-grad. So that is the situation of renting off-campus. They're limited shuttle services. So not all of us have these privileges of travelling to places of rest. Right now, what's your situation? Right now, I'm travelling. I'm travelling from home, from Kailisha to Kelp. And how much does that cost you every day? Basically, I buy a weekly or a monthly ticket. So if I'm using a bus, I'm going to buy a weekly ticket of around 300 for a weekly. A Golden Arrow bus, approximately, I'm not sure. But for a train, it's 190 or more. I mean, 190 to 200 trains. So during winter, I use a bus. But when it's back in summer, I return to a train. What's your situation? Sometimes I hear, what do you do at university? Because sometimes you finish late. Of course, of course. And then what happens? When I'm in full-time train services, I end up sleeping over on campus. Where do you sleep? Which is not good. Because security staff on my friend's residence do hassle me on coming in and spending night and crashing at my friend's place. So I end up sleeping in a study hall because the library closes at around 2 o'clock in the morning. So after 2 o'clock, everybody is expected to move. Thanks very much. We have serious issues of rent, not only in Cape Town. We have very serious issues. Johannesburg, in Port Elizabeth, around the mining towns and elsewhere. We would like to hear from you. What are your experiences? Call us on 021-446-0567. 011-0883-0702. 011-0883-0702. Give us your views. I'm going to Marcelo from Troival. Marcelo, welcome. Hello. Marcelo, welcome. Hi. Thank you. Thank you. If you know, I'm going through such a painful experience in Johannesburg. Tell us about it. Yeah. I've been renting an apartment in Troival for a few months. And then the agent of the place is now refusing to give me my deposit, which I think is very unfair. First of all, they charged me a thousand rand extra for an agent fee. I've never heard of that. This, have you heard of that agent fee? It doesn't exist and it's unlawful not to give you your deposit back. Yeah. No, they charge, there's a new thing in Joburg now, especially these new developments, this gentrified nonsense here. These Maboneng people, they charge you a thousand rand extra for something called an agent fee. So I paid it because, you know, I was desperate for a place. Then I spoke to a friend of mine who's a lawyer and said, you know, I don't think this thing is fair. And then he said to me, but you signed the contract. I'm paying my normal rent on top of the so-called agent fee. Then they cut my year's lease short themselves. They cut the lease. They give me 30 days notice. I asked them when I'm going to get the deposit. They said 18 to 20 days. Then they don't say anything. 25 days later, they are quiet. I called them. Oh, we had some queries. And then I said to them, how could you have queries when you didn't query them with me? What do you mean? That place was dead when I moved in. You never painted it. Now they've painted that flat with my money. They don't want to give me the deposit. So my question to you is, have you had legal assistance from anyone? It's taking a bit of a time because it's a recent situation. And normally I prefer handling things myself because people say they'll help you. Then they say, actually, no, it's not pro bono. So now I'm jumping from person to person and depending on their time as well, which is why I prefer handling things myself actually. Okay, it's good. I hope that people empower themselves to do so. But you can go to Siri, stay on the line or not stay on the line. Listen in, continue listening in. You'd hear from someone from the Social Economic Rights Institute in Johannesburg and they will be able to help more. Let me say it's 11 o'clock. We have to go to news. This is Eyewitness News. Good morning. I'm Aurelie Kalinga, a South African woman currently in Nice where at least 84 people were killed in an attack during Bastille Day celebrations says there was complete mayhem shortly after the incident. Kata Dutoit is a cabin crew member and arrived in France on layover yesterday. More than hundreds were injured when a 31-year-old Tunisian-born man fired a shot before mowing people down watching a fireworks display. Authorities later shot and killed the man and found explosive grenades and firearms in his vehicle. Dutoit says she was dining at a local restaurant when she heard a shot fired. And then screaming. Just after we finished our food, suddenly a whole group of people started rushing through and more and more people started coming and then people started running and people were crying, people were screaming, someone on their phones. She says she didn't understand what was happening but she knew something was wrong. And he asked them what's going on and all we heard was something's going on down on the promenade because they've heard gunshots and it's just craziness. Meanwhile, no organisation has claimed responsibility for the attack. Police say the Franco-Tunisian driver was only known to them in connection with common law crimes such as theft and violence but not to intelligence services. Jean-Jacques Cornish reports. The truck driver swerved along his deadly two-kilometre killing route to hit a maximum number of people. He's known as a petty criminal but was not on any terror watch list. Two years ago, IS spokesman Abu Mohamed Al-Adnani urged militants to use anything they could, including knives and vehicles, to kill civilians in the United States, Canada and France. He said at the time that terrorists didn't need to get an IS stamp of approval for operations. Jean-Jacques Cornish, Eyewitness News. France is still reeling from a November 2015 attack in which more than 130 people were killed in a series of attacks in Paris. Home forensic investigator Paulo Sullivan has arrived back in the country after a trip to London. His lawyers applied for an interdict in an urgent application in the Johannesburg High Court yesterday to stop police from arresting him again. The application was dismissed and O'Sullivan landed at Orotumbo International Airport a short while ago with no police officers in sight. Gia Nicolaides was there. It's understood police were expected to arrest Paulo Sullivan again today when he landed in South Africa despite an undertaking not to do so. It's also understood that O'Sullivan has landed in New York City on his daughter's birthday. O'Sullivan has landed and told Eyewitness News that he has nothing to be afraid of. Well, my next step is to go home, have a shower, go to court. I'm not afraid of any of these charges. They're all trumped up charges. When you've got hawks that have formed alliances with criminals to take down somebody that's exposing corruption, this is what you see. A summons has been issued for O'Sullivan to appear in court today on a new charge of fraud. He already faces charges of extortion, intimidation and fraud. Gia Nicolaides, Eyewitness News, Orotumbo International Airport. The situation is untenable. At some point, enough is enough. How much more can SAA actually endure? How much more can we as South Africans be expected to endure? There is clearly a complete and utter chaotic state of leadership. You can't even call it leadership at SAA. A mother and daughter are in a critical condition in hospital this morning after suffering smoke inhalation in Boxburg on the East Rand. Two children died yesterday after a coal stove was left burning overnight, filling the family's RDP home with carbon monoxide. It's understood the two sisters were keeping warm around the stove, along with four adults. Ekoruleni Emergency Services, William Ntladi. The mother and the elder daughter were still unconscious and both of them were transported by ambulance to hospital, which is Telamuhera, a regional hospital in Postloras. Meanwhile, authorities in KwaZulu-Natal are investigating yesterday's fire at a Durban orphanage, which left eight orphans dead. And the United Nations has withdrawn its non-critical staff out of South Sudan following fighting in the war-torn country, accusing President Salva Kiir's troops of targeting its foreign workers. At least 200 people have been killed and thousands more displaced following clashes between Kiir and his deputy, Riek Machar. The two leaders have appealed for calm and a fragile ceasefire seems to be holding. However, the UN believes fighting could resume again. Here at home, Durkos Klesen Monella says there are measures in place for those who want to return. Gold's trading at $1,332.71 an ounce.

Welcome back to Friday Standing. My name is Zaki Ahmed. We're talking about rents. We would love to have your calls. I'll give you the numbers later in a second. But first, we're going to Princess in Freedom Park. Princess, tell us a little bit about your problem. My problem, as I said, you know, I've been renting. I don't, you know, even my children, when they have some assignment that says, tell us maybe a story about where you're staying or about your area. They don't know what to say because we've been in so many areas because of not affording rent, because of the increase of the renter. And now, as I'm saying, last year I stayed in an RTP house. I was renting. Then the owner evicted me without a notice. Then I rented another one. Same story. And now I'm staying in a shack in somebody else's backyard. So there are so many rules, which it makes hard even for my children to just stay outside. Like now my daughter, she's always inside the shack because she's scared to just walk around in the yard because of the rules. If you maybe go and fetch water, the owner will count how many times are you fetching the water? How many times do you go to the toilet? How many times are you opening my gate? You know, things like that. So I tried to apply for an RTP house. Until I lose my C-form. Then when I go and reported that now I lost my C-form, they said you have to reapply again and now you'll be back in the list. Then I asked which list because they said before I wasn't in the system. Then the lady started shouting at me. So what I'm asking, why is the government can't help us to make maybe something for us to qualify to buy houses? Because if we try to buy a house, they say your salary is too low. Yes. Thank you very much, Promise. I'm sure we're going to chat later about the problems you face, but your evictions are unlawful. Portia from Tembisa or Hyde Park, rather. Portia? Yes, I'm working as a domestic worker in Hyde Park, but I'm staying in Tembisa. Right. It's a long distance. I'm paying R1,000 and then I'm paying R250 for electricity. And then I'm staying in a 4x4 room doing everything there, cooking and everything. So I've got two children. My son is dead. I'm talking to the villagers because now we can't live together. We can't do anything in one room. So now I'm staying with a two and a half daughter. You know what? Last week his dad was bathing and he started to ask, Mommy, I see something in front of my baby. What is this, Mommy? I don't know what to say, really. I started to be shocked. After that, in like a weekend, I started to take him out if his baby wanted to bath because I can't answer those questions. So it's cold sometimes. It's difficult to go outside if your baby's bathing. It's very difficult. It's very difficult to stay in one place doing everything. Portia, thank you very much for your call. And the difficulty of rent increases of the oppression of domestic workers and so on. If you continue here listening, we'll be hearing from rent tribunal people. We'll be hearing from people in Johannesburg, experts from Johannesburg. So right now, we're moving. Right now, we're just moving for a break. Thanks very much. News and Talk Station.

Let me say, we're having a fantastic discussion about renting your apartment. I have a very good landlord. I've just moved, but I had a very good landlord who maintained a low rent for the apartment I was living in and so on. But most people don't have that experience. And today we're joined by a number of people in Johannesburg and in Cape Town who can answer many of your questions. And I'm going to speak to them one by one.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.16, "text": " late last year,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [3469, 1036, 1064, 11], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob":

He was a post-grad. So that is the situation of renting off-campus. They're limited shuttle services. So not all of us have these privileges of travelling to places of rest. Right now, what's your situation? Right now, I'm travelling. I'm travelling from home, from Kailisha to Kelp. And how much does that cost you every day? Basically, I buy a weekly or a monthly ticket. So if I'm using a bus, I'm going to buy a weekly ticket of around 300 for a weekly. A Golden Arrow bus, approximately, I'm not sure. But for a train, it's 190 or more. I mean, 190 to 200 trains. So during winter, I use a bus. But when it's back in summer, I return to a train. What's your situation? Sometimes I hear, what do you do at university? Because sometimes you finish late. Of course, of course. And then what happens? When I'm in full-time train services, I end up sleeping over on campus. Where do you sleep? Which is not good. Because security staff on my friend's residence do hassle me on coming in and spending night and crashing at my friend's place. So I end up sleeping in a study hall because the library closes at around 2 o'clock in the morning. So after 2 o'clock, everybody is expected to move. Thanks very much. We have serious issues of rent, not only in Cape Town. We have very serious issues. Johannesburg, in Port Elizabeth, around the mining towns and elsewhere. We would like to hear from you. What are your experiences? Call us on 021-446-0567. 011-0883-0702. 011-0883-0702. Give us your views. I'm going to Marcelo from Troival. Marcelo, welcome. Hello. Marcelo, welcome. Hi. Thank you. Thank you. If you know, I'm going through such a painful experience in Johannesburg. Tell us about it. Yeah. I've been renting an apartment in Troival for a few months. And then the agent of the place is now refusing to give me my deposit, which I think is very unfair. First of all, they charged me a thousand rand extra for an agent fee. I've never heard of that. This, have you heard of that agent fee? It doesn't exist and it's unlawful not to give you your deposit back. Yeah. No, they charge, there's a new thing in Joburg now, especially these new developments, this gentrified nonsense here. These Maboneng people, they charge you a thousand rand extra for something called an agent fee. So I paid it because, you know, I was desperate for a place. Then I spoke to a friend of mine who's a lawyer and said, you know, I don't think this thing is fair. And then he said to me, but you signed the contract. I'm paying my normal rent on top of the so-called agent fee. Then they cut my year's lease short themselves. They cut the lease. They give me 30 days notice. I asked them when I'm going to get the deposit. They said 18 to 20 days. Then they don't say anything. 25 days later, they are quiet. I called them. Oh, we had some queries. And then I said to them, how could you have queries when you didn't query them with me? What do you mean? That place was dead when I moved in. You never painted it. Now they've painted that flat with my money. They don't want to give me the deposit. So my question to you is, have you had legal assistance from anyone? It's taking a bit of a time because it's a recent situation. And normally I prefer handling things myself because people say they'll help you. Then they say, actually, no, it's not pro bono. So now I'm jumping from person to person and depending on their time as well, which is why I prefer handling things myself actually. Okay, it's good. I hope that people empower themselves to do so. But you can go to Siri, stay on the line or not stay on the line. Listen in, continue listening in. You'd hear from someone from the Social Economic Rights Institute in Johannesburg and they will be able to help more. Let me say it's 11 o'clock. We have to go to news. This is Eyewitness News. Good morning. I'm Aurelie Kalinga, a South African woman currently in Nice where at least 84 people were killed in an attack during Bastille Day celebrations says there was complete mayhem shortly after the incident. Kata Dutoit is a cabin crew member and arrived in France on layover yesterday. More than hundreds were injured when a 31-year-old Tunisian-born man fired a shot before mowing people down watching a fireworks display. Authorities later shot and killed the man and found explosive grenades and firearms in his vehicle. Dutoit says she was dining at a local restaurant when she heard a shot fired. And then screaming. Just after we finished our food, suddenly a whole group of people started rushing through and more and more people started coming and then people started running and people were crying, people were screaming, someone on their phones. She says she didn't understand what was happening but she knew something was wrong. And he asked them what's going on and all we heard was something's going on down on the promenade because they've heard gunshots and it's just craziness. Meanwhile, no organisation has claimed responsibility for the attack. Police say the Franco-Tunisian driver was only known to them in connection with common law crimes such as theft and violence but not to intelligence services. Jean-Jacques Cornish reports. The truck driver swerved along his deadly two-kilometre killing route to hit a maximum number of people. He's known as a petty criminal but was not on any terror watch list. Two years ago, IS spokesman Abu Mohamed Al-Adnani urged militants to use anything they could, including knives and vehicles, to kill civilians in the United States, Canada and France. He said at the time that terrorists didn't need to get an IS stamp of approval for operations. Jean-Jacques Cornish, Eyewitness News. France is still reeling from a November 2015 attack in which more than 130 people were killed in a series of attacks in Paris. Home forensic investigator Paulo Sullivan has arrived back in the country after a trip to London. His lawyers applied for an interdict in an urgent application in the Johannesburg High Court yesterday to stop police from arresting him again. The application was dismissed and O'Sullivan landed at Orotumbo International Airport a short while ago with no police officers in sight. Gia Nicolaides was there. It's understood police were expected to arrest Paulo Sullivan again today when he landed in South Africa despite an undertaking not to do so. It's also understood that O'Sullivan has landed in New York City on his daughter's birthday. O'Sullivan has landed and told Eyewitness News that he has nothing to be afraid of. Well, my next step is to go home, have a shower, go to court. I'm not afraid of any of these charges. They're all trumped up charges. When you've got hawks that have formed alliances with criminals to take down somebody that's exposing corruption, this is what you see. A summons has been issued for O'Sullivan to appear in court today on a new charge of fraud. He already faces charges of extortion, intimidation and fraud. Gia Nicolaides, Eyewitness News, Orotumbo International Airport. The situation is untenable. At some point, enough is enough. How much more can SAA actually endure? How much more can we as South Africans be expected to endure? There is clearly a complete and utter chaotic state of leadership. You can't even call it leadership at SAA. A mother and daughter are in a critical condition in hospital this morning after suffering smoke inhalation in Boxburg on the East Rand. Two children died yesterday after a coal stove was left burning overnight, filling the family's RDP home with carbon monoxide. It's understood the two sisters were keeping warm around the stove, along with four adults. Ekoruleni Emergency Services, William Ntladi. The mother and the elder daughter were still unconscious and both of them were transported by ambulance to hospital, which is Telamuhera, a regional hospital in Postloras. Meanwhile, authorities in KwaZulu-Natal are investigating yesterday's fire at a Durban orphanage, which left eight orphans dead. And the United Nations has withdrawn its non-critical staff out of South Sudan following fighting in the war-torn country, accusing President Salva Kiir's troops of targeting its foreign workers. At least 200 people have been killed and thousands more displaced following clashes between Kiir and his deputy, Riek Machar. The two leaders have appealed for calm and a fragile ceasefire seems to be holding. However, the UN believes fighting could resume again. Here at home, Durkos Klesen Monella says there are measures in place for those who want to return. Gold's trading at $1,332.71 an ounce.

Welcome back to Friday Standing. My name is Zaki Ahmed. We're talking about rents. We would love to have your calls. I'll give you the numbers later in a second. But first, we're going to Princess in Freedom Park. Princess, tell us a little bit about your problem. My problem, as I said, you know, I've been renting. I don't, you know, even my children, when they have some assignment that says, tell us maybe a story about where you're staying or about your area. They don't know what to say because we've been in so many areas because of not affording rent, because of the increase of the renter. And now, as I'm saying, last year I stayed in an RTP house. I was renting. Then the owner evicted me without a notice. Then I rented another one. Same story. And now I'm staying in a shack in somebody else's backyard. So there are so many rules, which it makes hard even for my children to just stay outside. Like now my daughter, she's always inside the shack because she's scared to just walk around in the yard because of the rules. If you maybe go and fetch water, the owner will count how many times are you fetching the water? How many times do you go to the toilet? How many times are you opening my gate? You know, things like that. So I tried to apply for an RTP house. Until I lose my C-form. Then when I go and reported that now I lost my C-form, they said you have to reapply again and now you'll be back in the list. Then I asked which list because they said before I wasn't in the system. Then the lady started shouting at me. So what I'm asking, why is the government can't help us to make maybe something for us to qualify to buy houses? Because if we try to buy a house, they say your salary is too low. Yes. Thank you very much, Promise. I'm sure we're going to chat later about the problems you face, but your evictions are unlawful. Portia from Tembisa or Hyde Park, rather. Portia? Yes, I'm working as a domestic worker in Hyde Park, but I'm staying in Tembisa. Right. It's a long distance. I'm paying R1,000 and then I'm paying R250 for electricity. And then I'm staying in a 4x4 room doing everything there, cooking and everything. So I've got two children. My son is dead. I'm talking to the villagers because now we can't live together. We can't do anything in one room. So now I'm staying with a two and a half daughter. You know what? Last week his dad was bathing and he started to ask, Mommy, I see something in front of my baby. What is this, Mommy? I don't know what to say, really. I started to be shocked. After that, in like a weekend, I started to take him out if his baby wanted to bath because I can't answer those questions. So it's cold sometimes. It's difficult to go outside if your baby's bathing. It's very difficult. It's very difficult to stay in one place doing everything. Portia, thank you very much for your call. And the difficulty of rent increases of the oppression of domestic workers and so on. If you continue here listening, we'll be hearing from rent tribunal people. We'll be hearing from people in Johannesburg, experts from Johannesburg. So right now, we're moving. Right now, we're just moving for a break. Thanks very much. News and Talk Station.

Let me say, we're having a fantastic discussion about renting your apartment. I have a very good landlord. I've just moved, but I had a very good landlord who maintained a low rent for the apartment I was living in and so on. But most people don't have that experience.
