{"text": " And I thought we could start our kind of open up our talk, ladies, by just beginning with sort of some of the myths that are out there about domestic violence. I mean, it's been now a good long time that the phrase domestic violence has been in use. It's been a while of consciousness raising and so on happening. But I feel probably pretty secure in saying that there's still a lot of misconceptions around what the issues are. What causes domestic violence? Who suffers? You know, whose fault is it? And all of those things. I just wondered if you could kind of tell us a little bit in your travels and the work that you do, if you could give us some examples. What's some of the stuff that unfortunately still persists as things people believe to be true about domestic violence? Wow, that's a loaded question. We're all about the loaded question here on Scurio. Some of the myths would be that domestic violence is just a man-woman thing, you know, and it's not just a man-woman thing and that it doesn't just happen in heterosexual relationships. It's a people thing and that domestic violence, people want to say it is only targeted to people that are maybe in low income or in urban cities. But, you know, domestic violence does not discriminate. It doesn't care who you are, what you do. But domestic violence affects everyone. And it doesn't just affect the couple that's in the relationship. It affects if there's children there. It affects the support network. It affects everyone. It affects your health. It affects everything. I don't know if you want to say anything. I would say I agree a great deal with what Melissa was just saying. It is definitely true working at a gay, lesbian, bi, trans organization that we hear all the time that why would we need to have this system of support for GLBT people? And actually domestic violence happens in the GLBT communities the same rate as in heterosexual domestic violence, which would be about 25 to 33 percent. And I think that a myth that's out there also within the communities is that it doesn't happen in our community. No one wants to think about it happening in our community. Right. It's everybody says, yeah, yeah, somebody else's problem. Right. Uh-huh. And that's definitely not the case. I mean, you, I mean, for me, being an advocate, you can get a call on anything, you know, and there's like, there's trends that somewhat happen, you know, during the holidays and things like that. Oh, when it gets really nice outside, then it seems like there's like an influx of incidents that happen and then it dies down. And it's sort of like this wave that that happens. And so you like, you got to definitely be on your on your toes, you know, because you just never know what's going to happen. Because every day it's different. Every day you may be faced with something that you're like, I don't even know, you know, but it's good that there's there's advocates in this networks like La Red, which we can bridge those gaps, bridge those bridges together so we can work in collaboration with each other. Because I may have someone that walked through the door that's transgender. And I may not necessarily know how to best advocate for this person. But I know that I could turn to Sabrina and let me call Sabrina. Like, Sabrina, do you know what I can do in this instance? So it's about really building collaboratives with each other. Because it's not, you know, domestic violence, like I said before, it affects everything and affects everyone. And so it's not just, you know, a man is an island. It's about everything. I think one of the things that I've found happening over time, that has been really positive is that I think, as we, you know, as communities, we get more aware of the fact that we're not alone. We're aware of how much culture plays a role in what happens in a particular neighborhood and a particular family. We've been able to tailor the organizations that are out there a little more specifically. So I'm thinking, for example, I know that there are organizations that are specifically for Latinas who are dealing with issues of domestic violence. I know that there is an Asian Pacific organization. I can't Asian Task Force. We hope, I would like to hope anyway, that we've come a little bit farther from that. I'm glad you said that when you talked about culture, because I think that plays a huge part in when you talk about domestic violence. Because you want to be culturally competent and culturally sensitive to anybody that walks through your door. And so it's about understanding where everybody's coming from. Because, you know, everybody isn't the same. But once you have an understanding of what this culture does, because in some cultures, there's something I may not think is right, maybe right in another culture. So it's being able to, you have to be able to understand, have some type of understanding of the different cultures that there are. Can you give us an example of something? Oh, Lord. Well, I can actually jump in on that. Thank you. A form of abuse that we talk about a great deal in the GLBT communities that's true to any specific culture is something we call cultural identity abuse. Any abuse that's usually focused against a marginalized group of some sort. And it's usually around identity. And it can be things, tactics like preventing the survivor from having connections to their own community, being able to speak their own language at home around the batterer, being able to, threatening around identity. So threatening to out someone who may not be able to be out in their job, with their family, in their community. So all these pieces, I think, are types of control that batterers use to control survivors. Right. Definitely. Thank you, Sabrina. Yeah, because there's that whole power control type thing that happens in relationships. Can you talk a little bit more about that? No, because really, power and control, I think that's the key here. And a lot of people just don't see that, you know, oh, domestic violence. Isn't that just like, you know, like I beat up on my significant other because, you know, he or she bothers me? Can I jump in? Yes. So the network, we define domestic violence as a pattern of control where one person is trying to control the thoughts, beliefs, and or the actions of someone close to them. And by that definition, only one person has that control. So in that case, we also don't say have what you can. Some people will actually say, which is a common myth, is that mutual abuse happens, that both parties are at fault. And by that definition of one person being in control, you can't really have something that's mutual, which is different from saying if you have a survivor that defends themselves with a physical action, that's not mutual abuse. That's a defensive action. And I think that a lot of what folks think around domestic violence is only the physical aspects. I was just going to say that. So if you talk about one person holding all of the power and controlling the other one, then that clearly can include things that are not physical. Definitely. It's a little bit more inclusive. Yeah, the main categories that we talk about are emotional, physical, sexual, financial abuse, and cultural identity abuse. And I think that's also what makes it hard for people to understand why someone doesn't just leave. And I say that in quotes, just leave. Because the layers of control and manipulation are just so intense and controlling that I think a lot of survivors spend so much time just trying to survive in that relationship, that being able to think about how to get out of that relationship, and then who wants to believe this person that you love and care about would be doing this by choice. And I think that's a hard thing for people to come to terms with. And if you're able to come to terms with that, there may just be so many practical hurdles to get over at that point. I was just thinking when you were saying financial abuse, that's not a category that naturally springs to mind to someone like me that isn't working in the field. But I imagine that being the person who controls all of the couple's money, if I need to get some cash for some sort of thing. You got to go through somebody else. Like Sabrina was saying, it's so much, it's deeper than that. It's so much more than that. The wounds that last the most are the emotional, are the verbal abuse. It's not just the physical. I think that's just something that people just really need to understand and realize that domestic violence is not just a physical thing. And we also know that when a survivor tries to leave the relationship, that can be actually the most dangerous time. Yes. So beyond the being in love with the partner and the layers of control and then the ability to leave, if they have money, do they have a place to go to? Will they have a support system? There's also the risk that the violence could get much worse. And we do find that abusers will take steps that they may not have taken during the relationship when they see the risk of losing the partner. Exactly. And it takes the individual in the relationship, it takes them more than seven times to leave completely, to leave fully, because there's a lot of back and forth that goes, because you go through all these different emotions, like should I, should I? If you have children in the mix, well, I want my child to have another parent there. You have money. How am I going to get by? How am I going to get groceries? Where am I going to stay? And it's like all these different things. So seven times, that's like the average for? No, it takes some, I can't, I don't even want to say like put numbers on it, but it takes, it takes an individual more than, am I correct, the seven? I don't know the seven reference that you're making. But definitely we've experienced people going back many times. Right. And I think it also speaks to the amount of support and resources that are out there. You know, when you're faced with, do I go into a shelter? Or do I go stay at a friend's house on their couch? And then what do I do if I have children? How do I keep them in school and give them stability? All these things together, I think, make it more difficult. And let's face it, people who have children and whose batter is the partner or the parent, a co-parent, they're never really going to be completely able to separate from their partner because there is a legal custody of children they'll have to deal with on an ongoing basis. Wow. And so do you run into situations where in your, well, your position as the director of organizing and education, Sabrina, so maybe this doesn't affect you so much in your own direct work, but do you end up perhaps providing references for getting the legal aspects taken care of? I would imagine that, you know, in terms of like custody battles and so on, that could get pretty ugly. Definitely. And I actually have worked as an advocate also. So I do have, I've had experience with that. And to be, to be honest, the network is a small organization. So we all do, we all chip in and we all do the advocacy also. Everybody does a little bit of everything.

some of the myths that are out there about domestic violence. I mean, it's been now a good long time that the phrase domestic violence has been in use. It's been a while of consciousness raising and so on happening. But I feel probably pretty secure in saying that there's still a lot of misconceptions around what the issues are. What causes domestic violence? Who suffers? You know, whose fault is it? And all of those things. I just wondered if you could kind of tell us a little bit in your travels and the work that you do, if you could give us some examples. What's some of the stuff that unfortunately still persists as things people believe to be true about domestic violence? Wow, that's a loaded question. We're all about the loaded question here on Scurio. Some of the myths would be that domestic violence is just a man-woman thing, you know, and it's not just a man-woman thing and that it doesn't just happen in heterosexual relationships. It's a people thing and that domestic violence, people want to say it is only targeted to people that are maybe in low income or in urban cities. But, you know, domestic violence does not discriminate. It doesn't care who you are, what you do. But domestic violence affects everyone. And it doesn't just affect the couple that's in the relationship. It affects if there's children there. It affects the support network. It affects everyone. It affects your health. It affects everything. I don't know if you want to say anything. I would say I agree a great deal with what Melissa was just saying. It is definitely true working at a gay, lesbian, bi, trans organization that we hear all the time that why would we need to have this system of support for GLBT people? And actually domestic violence happens in the GLBT communities the same rate as in heterosexual domestic violence, which would be about 25 to 33 percent. And I think that a myth that's out there also within the communities is that it doesn't happen in our community. No one wants to think about it happening in our community. Right. It's everybody says, yeah, yeah, somebody else's problem. Right. Uh-huh. And that's definitely not the case. I mean, you, I mean, for me, being an advocate, you can get a call on anything, you know, and there's like, there's trends that somewhat happen, you know, during the holidays and things like that. Oh, when it gets really nice outside, then it seems like there's like an influx of incidents that happen and then it dies down. And it's sort of like this wave that that happens. And so you like, you got to definitely be on your on your toes, you know, because you just never know what's going to happen. Because every day it's different. Every day you may be faced with something that you're like, I don't even know, you know, but it's good that there's there's advocates in this networks like La Red, which we can bridge those gaps, bridge those bridges together so we can work in collaboration with each other. Because I may have someone that walked through the door that's transgender. And I may not necessarily know how to best advocate for this person. But I know that I could turn to Sabrina and let me call Sabrina. Like, Sabrina, do you know what I can do in this instance? So it's about really building collaboratives with each other. Because it's not, you know, domestic violence, like I said before, it affects everything and affects everyone. And so it's not just, you know, a man is an island. It's about everything. I think one of the things that I've found happening over time, that has been really positive is that I think, as we, you know, as communities, we get more aware of the fact that we're not alone. We're aware of how much culture plays a role in what happens in a particular neighborhood and a particular family. We've been able to tailor the organizations that are out there a little more specifically. So I'm thinking, for example, I know that there are organizations that are specifically for Latinas who are dealing with issues of domestic violence. I know that there is an Asian Pacific organization. I can't Asian Task Force. We hope, I would like to hope anyway, that we've come a little bit farther from that. I'm glad you said that when you talked about culture, because I think that plays a huge part in when you talk about domestic violence. Because you want to be culturally competent and culturally sensitive to anybody that walks through your door. And so it's about understanding where everybody's coming from. Because, you know, everybody isn't the same. But once you have an understanding of what this culture does, because in some cultures, there's something I may not think is right, maybe right in another culture. So it's being able to, you have to be able to understand, have some type of understanding of the different cultures that there are. Can you give us an example of something? Oh, Lord. Well, I can actually jump in on that. Thank you. A form of abuse that we talk about a great deal in the GLBT communities that's true to any specific culture is something we call cultural identity abuse. Any abuse that's usually focused against a marginalized group of some sort. And it's usually around identity. And it can be things, tactics like preventing the survivor from having connections to their own community, being able to speak their own language at home around the batterer, being able to, threatening around identity. So threatening to out someone who may not be able to be out in their job, with their family, in their community. So all these pieces, I think, are types of control that batterers use to control survivors. Right. Definitely. Thank you, Sabrina. Yeah, because there's that whole power control type thing that happens in relationships. Can you talk a little bit more about that? No, because really, power and control, I think that's the key here. And a lot of people just don't see that, you know, oh, domestic violence. Isn't that just like, you know, like I beat up on my significant other because, you know, he or she bothers me? Can I jump in? Yes. So the network, we define domestic violence as a pattern of control where one person is trying to control the thoughts, beliefs, and or the actions of someone close to them. And by that definition, only one person has that control. So in that case, we also don't say have what you can. Some people will actually say, which is a common myth, is that mutual abuse happens, that both parties are at fault. And by that definition of one person being in control, you can't really have something that's mutual, which is different from saying if you have a survivor that defends themselves with a physical action, that's not mutual abuse. That's a defensive action. And I think that a lot of what folks think around domestic violence is only the physical aspects. I was just going to say that. So if you talk about one person holding all of the power and controlling the other one, then that clearly can include things that are not physical. Definitely. It's a little bit more inclusive. Yeah, the main categories that we talk about are emotional, physical, sexual, financial abuse, and cultural identity abuse. And I think that's also what makes it hard for people to understand why someone doesn't just leave. And I say that in quotes, just leave. Because the layers of control and manipulation are just so intense and controlling that I think a lot of survivors spend so much time just trying to survive in that relationship, that being able to think about how to get out of that relationship, and then who wants to believe this person that you love and care about would be doing this by choice. And I think that's a hard thing for people to come to terms with. And if you're able to come to terms with that, there may just be so many practical hurdles to get over at that point. I was just thinking when you were saying financial abuse, that's not a category that naturally springs to mind to someone like me that isn't working in the field. But I imagine that being the person who controls all of the couple's money, if I need to get some cash for some sort of thing. You got to go through somebody else. Like Sabrina was saying, it's so much, it's deeper than that. It's so much more than that. The wounds that last the most are the emotional, are the verbal abuse. It's not just the physical. I think that's just something that people just really need to understand and realize that domestic violence is not just a physical thing. And we also know that when a survivor tries to leave the relationship, that can be actually the most dangerous time. Yes. So beyond the being in love with the partner and the layers of control and then the ability to leave, if they have money, do they have a place to go to? Will they have a support system? There's also the risk that the violence could get much worse. And we do find that abusers will take steps that they may not have taken during the relationship when they see the risk of losing the partner. Exactly. And it takes the individual in the relationship, it takes them more than seven times to leave completely, to leave fully, because there's a lot of back and forth that goes, because you go through all these different emotions, like should I, should I? If you have children in the mix, well, I want my child to have another parent there. You have money. How am I going to get by? How am I going to get groceries? Where am I going to stay? And it's like all these different things. So seven times, that's like the average for? No, it takes some, I can't, I don't even want to say like put numbers on it, but it takes, it takes an individual more than, am I correct, the seven? I don't know the seven reference that you're making. But definitely we've experienced people going back many times. Right. And I think it also speaks to the amount of support and resources that are out there. You know, when you're faced with, do I go into a shelter? Or do I go stay at a friend's house on their couch? And then what do I do if I have children? How do I keep them in school and give them stability? All these things together, I think, make it more difficult. And let's face it, people who have children and whose batter is the partner or the parent, a co-parent, they're never really going to be completely able to separate from their partner because there is a legal custody of children they'll have to deal with on an ongoing basis. Wow. And so do you run into situations where in your, well, your position as the director of organizing and education, Sabrina, so maybe this doesn't affect you so much in your own direct work, but do you end up perhaps providing references for getting the legal aspects taken care of? I would imagine that, you know, in terms of like custody battles and so on, that could get pretty ugly. Definitely. And I actually have worked as an advocate also. So I do have, I've had experience with that. And to be, to be honest, the network is a small organization. So we all do, we all chip in and we all do the advocacy also. Everybody does a little bit of everything.
