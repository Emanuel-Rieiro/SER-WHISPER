{"text": " In many ways, Robin already was an ability. But anyway. No, I think the fact is that robbing from the oppressing rich to give to the oppressed is something that works in virtually any... I mean, you can do Shadowrun as a Robin Hood game. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And we have done Robin Hood-like missions for Shadowrun where we have done something for the poor to protect them from the rich. Not necessarily robbed and given money. But that easily could come up. But it's a very similar thing. And you're right. It does lend itself in the fact that there is a core party of Robin Hood. It's not just his merry men. It's Robin Hood, Little John, Will Scarlet. Friar Tuck. Friar Tuck, Alan and Dale, Maid Marian. There is an adventure party right there. There's a wide cast of supporting characters. And then you've got interesting compelling villains as well. I mean, with the Sheriff and Prince John. You've got some compelling villains and compelling NPCs because King Richard is a key figure in the whole thing. And he barely shows up in the story. So you've got that kind of overarching NPC that kind of is running things or is looming over the entire proceedings as well. So you can have that divine intervention if the game gets stale or the game is starting to get your butts kicked. You can have the King show up and rescue everybody. But yeah, I mean, you're right. It lends itself to other things besides just medieval low fantasy. You can do high fantasy where you just throw all sorts of magic and stuff in it. I wrote down a few suggestions for just possible variations on the theme before we did the episode. My favorite one I think I've written down if you're just doing the straight Robin Hood and Little John stuff versus the Sheriff. Robin Hood and the Merry Men are all werewolves. Yeah. Prince John is an evil warlock that's taken over the kingdom. His evil warlock apprentice or sorcerer apprentice, the Sheriff. Yeah. And so the good has cursed everyone in England and Sherwood Forest and stuff. Robin and the Merry Men are able to resist and become werewolves instead of just like mindless drones. Yeah. There you go. And they're the ones that have to. Yeah. And then you have to obviously fix the fix the problem by going through and fighting the fighting the oppressors. No, that is that's it. An interesting take on it. And you can do all sorts of things. It's not it's not too far of a leap to just include magic, just straight up magic. OK, you know, you've got druids and they're from the forest. So they're all druids or they're all, you know, there's friar talk. Yeah. Yeah. You've got a you've got a cleric. I mean, you could very easily work higher levels of magic into this. You know, the prince is is using is a is a sorcerer who's casting spells to oppress people. I mean, Little John, he's a dragon. Yeah. Little John is a dragon. Interesting. Idea like I mean, but it works. I mean, because you can take that same framework of this group of people working to working to free the oppressed people or, you know, save the oppressed people. And I mean, and it doesn't necessarily like we mentioned other settings. You could do it. Shadowrun. You could do it with like a superhero game. You know, you could easily have the Avengers be, you know, having to go having to go rob Dr. Doom to spread the wealth to Latvia or whatever. I mean, right. And that's this could be anything from like the overarching campaign of you taking down this evil aristocracy to just a one off. You know, you have your hero game and you just have to go. You have to go save these people for this for this adventure. You know, it can be as big or small a thing as you want to use it. And so, I mean, it definitely lends itself to a lot of really kind of just straight up possibilities if you're just going and taking it just kind of from that straight ahead angle of we're the good guys. You know, save the help the people. Right. There's also some interesting things where you've got like the opposite angles and twisted a little bit. OK. What if what if it turns out that Robin is just a con man? It's just a criminal. Yeah. So they almost did this as a movie with Russell Crowe. The Russell Crowe Robin Robin Hood movie that came out in 2010, I think. It's not a it's not a great Robin Hood movie. It's not a terrible Robin Hood movie. It's just, you know, kind of there. Right. Yeah. That originally started off with a script called Sherwood, which was about Nottingham. I think it's what it's called. It's called Nottingham. And it was about it was the movie is from the sheriff Nottingham's perspective where he is the protector of Nottingham and trying to save the city from this band of thieves. Right. And that's actually a really compelling idea because, you know, because from a point of view. Yeah. Rob, like, Robin is a terrorist fighting the legitimate in-place government trying to bring it down. Right. And villainizing and demonizing the the legitimate in-place law enforcement. The other. Now, regardless of the fact that the law enforcement in that in that area probably probably kind of sucked. Well, it was medieval era. So, yeah, they probably weren't good. But I mean, you could easily do that again. Do that in a Shadowrun campaign. You got your group is hired on his course, you know, corporate security. To save from this group of outlaws that thinks that they're doing is, you know. Right. I mean, because we're Americans. OK. I'm, you know, so the idea of the idea of like spreading the wealth and like taking from the rich and like distributing it out to the poor is a not very is a not very well. Like, I mean, we've we've fought a Cold War. We had a cold like 50 year period where that idea was the enemy. So that's not something that we necessarily like as a as a country or as a culture. So you could easily work that into a campaign where you guys are trying, you know, where you said it during the Cold War era and you're the CIA trying to stop, you know, the Robin Hood esque Viet Cong or whatever, or, you know, the Soviets in this case. There's all sorts of great things. Castro is the perfect Robin Hood. I mean, there's yeah, there's a lot of interesting ways that you could apply that to period gaming or far future gaming. If you wanted to set it on a different planet in the sci fi setting, but have the same political situation play out because there's a lot of really interesting things going on there. If you're the type of person that has that type of group that can do like PvP gaming, that could actually be a really compelling PvP thing where you've got two different groups that are working on different things and then they come into conflict. There's a lot of interesting ways that you can do this. The other thing that kind of popped in my mind that I would think about this was in Shrek where, you know, in the movie Shrek where they run across Robin Hood and his married man and they're a bunch of thieving a-holes. Right. You know, like you can make them the villains very, very easily. Well, it doesn't matter how good your intentions are when you hold people up at sword point. You're still kind of the bad guy in someone's story. Exactly. So, you know, depending on the perspective, you've got a lot of play there where they can be the good guys or the bad guys. You could set it in the Old West. The sheriff is the sheriff. Like, the sheriff is the hero in every movie. Yeah. Or in every Old West movie. Yeah. Tell us the 15 examples that were wrong, Brady. Nope. Nope. Nope. It's not always true, but it is mostly true. It is mostly true. It is mostly true. But no, you're right. I mean, apply that to the Old West. Make Robin a hucksterish con man backed up by a gang of outlaws. I mean, you could easily do like a... Who robs trains. Stagecoach type thing. Stagecoaches. Where it's like, you know, you're the... You're hired on to protect a stagecoach that's being... Stagecoaches are being robbed on this area by this group of... By this gang of outlaws. Right. So you're hired to protect it. That's a fun game right there. That's a fun, you know, Deadlands game. I'm going to use a perfect example that is pre-Old West but post-Civil War. This is real world example, mind you. The James gang as well as the... Wow, my brain just locked up. To my knowledge, the James gang was post-Civil War. They were post-Civil War. Post-Civil War, but it was kind of... Yeah. Post-Civil War, but really not out in the Old West because this was in Missouri and Minnesota and stuff. Yeah, right. Remember, in a lot of places, especially where they were from, these guys were stealing from the corrupt union that had taken their land and theoretically redistributed it. They weren't. They were redistributing to themselves. Right. But still, you could easily take it... There is a very Robin Hood take on... You could take it that next step and have them actually do it. The Youngers and the James gangs where they were actually stealing from the crooked Yankees who were taking advantage of the... John Dillinger is another example, like the 30s. He was stealing from unions and granted, keeping a lot of it for himself, but that was part of the reason why he was so publicly loved is that he was giving away a lot of that. Yeah, he was robbing and murdering people, but he was redistributing some of that wealth. So as long as you've got... You could easily take that in a game and set it in... The early 20s or 30s during the Depression and being like, yeah, you guys are robbing from the government and redistributing... Or robbing from the Rockefeller fat cat to... Exactly, yeah. Everyone else is standing in food... Or like soup lines and they're driving around and being all great Gatsby. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's all sorts of really cool things that you can do with that. But I think that's the thing. You have to make sure that you keep those themes alive. And as long as you have the theme of the rich people that are oppressing other people, you've got conflict either way. Whether you want to have it... Whether you want to go the route of it's the righteous underdog that's trying to help people or if it's a con man trying to harm people. Right. You've got that conflict there. And I think that conflict can apply to any sort of time period or setting. Yeah, well, no doubt. I mean, it is one of the most classic stories. And that's why it works for everything. I've got a couple of variations on the theme here that I've written down. I'm going to mention them. Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Prince John and the Sheriff are pod people. And no one believes Robin except the Merry Men. Right. That's fair. I mean, yeah, you've got all sorts of... When you have that... When you have like everybody else in on it and a small group that's kind of outside the conspiracy, you can go as sci-fi heavy or as fantasy heavy or as conspiracy heavy as you want with that. Making Robin Hood a conspiracy game where they're not necessarily rich. They're just trying to uncover it. They're trying to uncover it. They're trying to save the people of this land of Sherwood Forest or America or Earth from this overreaching conspiracy being perpetrated by the people in power. Yeah. No, that's a really neat idea. Which, you know, pod people is just the easy one to do. Right. That's classic science fiction. You just insert conspiracy in replacement of money and it... Right. Essentially, you've done it. Mm-hmm. The other one that you had listed down was the post-apocalyptic one. Oh, yeah. But see, the post-apocalyptic's nice because then you don't have to worry about money or conspiracy. Then it can just be somebody has the water. Right. Well, I'm going to say this. Or somebody has the fuel. You saw Furry Road the other day. I've been watching a ton of Mad Max recently. Oh, my God. That is exactly what this is. You know, all of them, all three of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max because the first one doesn't quite fit in as well.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.52, "text": " In many ways, Robin already

{"text": " In many ways, Robin already was an ability. But anyway. No, I think the fact is that robbing from the oppressing rich to give to the oppressed is something that works in virtually any... I mean, you can do Shadowrun as a Robin Hood game. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And we have done Robin Hood-like missions for Shadowrun where we have done something for the poor to protect them from the rich. Not necessarily robbed and given money. But that easily could come up. But it's a very similar thing. And you're right. It does lend itself in the fact that there is a core party of Robin Hood. It's not just his merry men. It's Robin Hood, Little John, Will Scarlet. Friar Tuck. Friar Tuck, Alan and Dale, Maid Marian. There is an adventure party right there. There's a wide cast of supporting characters. And then you've got interesting compelling villains as well. I mean, with the Sheriff and Prince John. You've got some compelling villains and compelling NPCs because King Richard is a key figure in the whole thing. And he barely shows up in the story. So you've got that kind of overarching NPC that kind of is running things or is looming over the entire proceedings as well. So you can have that divine intervention if the game gets stale or the game is starting to get your butts kicked. You can have the King show up and rescue everybody. But yeah, I mean, you're right. It lends itself to other things besides just medieval low fantasy. You can do high fantasy where you just throw all sorts of magic and stuff in it. I wrote down a few suggestions for just possible variations on the theme before we did the episode. My favorite one I think I've written down if you're just doing the straight Robin Hood and Little John stuff versus the Sheriff. Robin Hood and the Merry Men are all werewolves. Yeah. Prince John is an evil warlock that's taken over the kingdom. His evil warlock apprentice or sorcerer apprentice, the Sheriff. Yeah. And so the good has cursed everyone in England and Sherwood Forest and stuff. Robin and the Merry Men are able to resist and become werewolves instead of just like mindless drones. Yeah. There you go. And they're the ones that have to. Yeah. And then you have to obviously fix the fix the problem by going through and fighting the fighting the oppressors. No, that is that's it. An interesting take on it. And you can do all sorts of things. It's not it's not too far of a leap to just include magic, just straight up magic. OK, you know, you've got druids and they're from the forest. So they're all druids or they're all, you know, there's friar talk. Yeah. Yeah. You've got a you've got a cleric. I mean, you could very easily work higher levels of magic into this. You know, the prince is is using is a is a sorcerer who's casting spells to oppress people. I mean, Little John, he's a dragon. Yeah. Little John is a dragon. Interesting. Idea like I mean, but it works. I mean, because you can take that same framework of this group of people working to working to free the oppressed people or, you know, save the oppressed people. And I mean, and it doesn't necessarily like we mentioned other settings. You could do it. Shadowrun. You could do it with like a superhero game. You know, you could easily have the Avengers be, you know, having to go having to go rob Dr. Doom to spread the wealth to Latvia or whatever. I mean, right. And that's this could be anything from like the overarching campaign of you taking down this evil aristocracy to just a one off. You know, you have your hero game and you just have to go. You have to go save these people for this for this adventure. You know, it can be as big or small a thing as you want to use it. And so, I mean, it definitely lends itself to a lot of really kind of just straight up possibilities if you're just going and taking it just kind of from that straight ahead angle of we're the good guys. You know, save the help the people. Right. There's also some interesting things where you've got like the opposite angles and twisted a little bit. OK. What if what if it turns out that Robin is just a con man? It's just a criminal. Yeah. So they almost did this as a movie with Russell Crowe. The Russell Crowe Robin Robin Hood movie that came out in 2010, I think. It's not a it's not a great Robin Hood movie. It's not a terrible Robin Hood movie. It's just, you know, kind of there. Right. Yeah. That originally started off with a script called Sherwood, which was about Nottingham. I think it's what it's called. It's called Nottingham. And it was about it was the movie is from the sheriff Nottingham's perspective where he is the protector of Nottingham and trying to save the city from this band of thieves. Right. And that's actually a really compelling idea because, you know, because from a point of view. Yeah. Rob, like, Robin is a terrorist fighting the legitimate in-place government trying to bring it down. Right. And villainizing and demonizing the the legitimate in-place law enforcement. The other. Now, regardless of the fact that the law enforcement in that in that area probably probably kind of sucked. Well, it was medieval era. So, yeah, they probably weren't good. But I mean, you could easily do that again. Do that in a Shadowrun campaign. You got your group is hired on his course, you know, corporate security. To save from this group of outlaws that thinks that they're doing is, you know. Right. I mean, because we're Americans. OK. I'm, you know, so the idea of the idea of like spreading the wealth and like taking from the rich and like distributing it out to the poor is a not very is a not very well. Like, I mean, we've we've fought a Cold War. We had a cold like 50 year period where that idea was the enemy. So that's not something that we necessarily like as a as a country or as a culture. So you could easily work that into a campaign where you guys are trying, you know, where you said it during the Cold War era and you're the CIA trying to stop, you know, the Robin Hood esque Viet Cong or whatever, or, you know, the Soviets in this case. There's all sorts of great things. Castro is the perfect Robin Hood. I mean, there's yeah, there's a lot of interesting ways that you could apply that to period gaming or far future gaming. If you wanted to set it on a different planet in the sci fi setting, but have the same political situation play out because there's a lot of really interesting things going on there. If you're the type of person that has that type of group that can do like PvP gaming, that could actually be a really compelling PvP thing where you've got two different groups that are working on different things and then they come into conflict. There's a lot of interesting ways that you can do this. The other thing that kind of popped in my mind that I would think about this was in Shrek where, you know, in the movie Shrek where they run across Robin Hood and his married man and they're a bunch of thieving a-holes. Right. You know, like you can make them the villains very, very easily. Well, it doesn't matter how good your intentions are when you hold people up at sword point. You're still kind of the bad guy in someone's story. Exactly. So, you know, depending on the perspective, you've got a lot of play there where they can be the good guys or the bad guys. You could set it in the Old West. The sheriff is the sheriff. Like, the sheriff is the hero in every movie. Yeah. Or in every Old West movie. Yeah. Tell us the 15 examples that were wrong, Brady. Nope. Nope. Nope. It's not always true, but it is mostly true. It is mostly true. It is mostly true. But no, you're right. I mean, apply that to the Old West. Make Robin a hucksterish con man backed up by a gang of outlaws. I mean, you could easily do like a... Who robs trains. Stagecoach type thing. Stagecoaches. Where it's like, you know, you're the... You're hired on to protect a stagecoach that's being... Stagecoaches are being robbed on this area by this group of... By this gang of outlaws. Right. So you're hired to protect it. That's a fun game right there. That's a fun, you know, Deadlands game. I'm going to use a perfect example that is pre-Old West but post-Civil War. This is real world example, mind you. The James gang as well as the... Wow, my brain just locked up. To my knowledge, the James gang was post-Civil War. They were post-Civil War. Post-Civil War, but it was kind of... Yeah. Post-Civil War, but really not out in the Old West because this was in Missouri and Minnesota and stuff. Yeah, right. Remember, in a lot of places, especially where they were from, these guys were stealing from the corrupt union that had taken their land and theoretically redistributed it. They weren't. They were redistributing to themselves. Right. But still, you could easily take it... There is a very Robin Hood take on... You could take it that next step and have them actually do it. The Youngers and the James gangs where they were actually stealing from the crooked Yankees who were taking advantage of the... John Dillinger is another example, like the 30s. He was stealing from unions and granted, keeping a lot of it for himself, but that was part of the reason why he was so publicly loved is that he was giving away a lot of that. Yeah, he was robbing and murdering people, but he was redistributing some of that wealth. So as long as you've got... You could easily take that in a game and set it in... The early 20s or 30s during the Depression and being like, yeah, you guys are robbing from the government and redistributing... Or robbing from the Rockefeller fat cat to... Exactly, yeah. Everyone else is standing in food... Or like soup lines and they're driving around and being all great Gatsby. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's all sorts of really cool things that you can do with that. But I think that's the thing. You have to make sure that you keep those themes alive. And as long as you have the theme of the rich people that are oppressing other people, you've got conflict either way. Whether you want to have it... Whether you want to go the route of it's the righteous underdog that's trying to help people or if it's a con man trying to harm people. Right. You've got that conflict there. And I think that conflict can apply to any sort of time period or setting. Yeah, well, no doubt. I mean, it is one of the most classic stories. And that's why it works for everything. I've got a couple of variations on the theme here that I've written down. I'm going to mention them. Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Prince John and the Sheriff are pod people. And no one believes Robin except the Merry Men. Right. That's fair. I mean, yeah, you've got all sorts of... When you have that... When you have like everybody else in on it and a small group that's kind of outside the conspiracy, you can go as sci-fi heavy or as fantasy heavy or as conspiracy heavy as you want with that. Making Robin Hood a conspiracy game where they're not necessarily rich. They're just trying to uncover it. They're trying to uncover it. They're trying to save the people of this land of Sherwood Forest or America or Earth from this overreaching conspiracy being perpetrated by the people in power. Yeah. No, that's a really neat idea. Which, you know, pod people is just the easy one to do. Right. That's classic science fiction. You just insert conspiracy in replacement of money and it... Right. Essentially, you've done it. Mm-hmm. The other one that you had listed down was the post-apocalyptic one. Oh, yeah. But see, the post-apocalyptic's nice because then you don't have to worry about money or conspiracy. Then it can just be somebody has the water. Right. Well, I'm going to say this. Or somebody has the fuel. You saw Furry Road the other day. I've been watching a ton of Mad Max recently. Oh, my God. That is exactly what this is.
