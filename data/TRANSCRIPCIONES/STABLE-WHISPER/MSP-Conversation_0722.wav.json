{"text": " and I'm standing up there. We're in a beautiful like brownstone old building in Westchester, Pennsylvania, which is a small suburban town of Philadelphia. It's not close to the city. So I was a little bit confused why she was there. So I'm grabbing, like I'm stretching my legs, grabbing a drink and it was, the snacks were set up along the window. So I look out and I see a blonde woman with two cameras interviewing people. And I turned to the rest of the room and most of the people in the room were from conservative and libertarian think tanks and organizations. And I said, is that Martha Raddatz? And they all kind of looked at me like, who is that? And I was like, really? Am I the only person in this room that watched the presidential debate? And they said, I don't know. I can't tell. And I said, screw it. I'm going downstairs. I'm going to see. So I walked out the front door and she had been across the street. She was still over there and I got a fix on her. And I was like, yeah, that's her. So I just hit record on my iPhone. I did edit out the beginning of it because it's me just chatting with this other woman who came down to see what the heck I was going to do. We decided that, yes, it was her. And then she crossed the street and she asked me if I wanted to be interviewed by her. And then we had the little confrontation, which was pleasant. I was completely polite as I want to do. And yeah, if you want to check it out, it's still up on my Twitter at Tracy L. Connors. I asked her about her bias and she seemed to disagree with me that she was biased at all. And then she walked away. And part of me wishes I would have let her interview me because that probably would have been a hoot. You wouldn't have made the final cut. You would have had your film crew film her film crew filming you. Yeah. And you could have shown that out. Of course, you can also catch that tape on the Enough Already podcast page on Facebook. Yes, true. But I did share it up there. But on Twitter, I got a lot of love. I think last I checked, it had one hundred and fifty thousand impressions on that little. Unbelievable. It's just like I wish more people would do this kind of stuff. I can't be the only person that randomly sees people that have been dishonest on television consistently. And why not just walk up to them and ask them a question? Well, they're running around microphones in people's faces. But that's the way America really has shifted in the last, oh, I don't know, 25 years. We are for collectively. I'm not saying we all are, but the country has turned into a bunch of pussies who do not want to have any part of any confrontation whatsoever. They're turning off debates because people are too angry, too angry, Tracy. And the last question of a debate has to be, can you say something nice about each other? Can you please say something nice about each other? Can you tell Hillary she looks pretty in that outfit, please? It would do a good long thing for healing America. So apparently it's not in our DNA anymore to walk up and confront these people. I don't know if it's just a matter of that. I do agree that's a certain part of it. But I do think that there is kind of this mentality set in, especially with people that are on television. And I've seen this from my days of working in production and being around, you know, superstar celebrities. People feel like there is a difference between them and the people they see on television. Yeah. From a different class. They're from a different planet. Who knows? But they're just people. She's clearly smarter than everyone, Tracy. She's on TV. Of course. You don't want to confront someone who's smarter than you, who's on TV, who moderates a debate. I mean, she must be brilliant. Oh, yeah, you're right. Silly me. I should have just left her be. She could not have gotten away from you fast enough. No. No, I think she was totally thrown because according to one of my exes, I dress like a liberal. So I'm quite disconcerting to her. And I did have a nicer top on. I wasn't wearing, I usually wear like a logo T-shirt. And that was a ploy that I used to never be thrown into a scene as an extra because you can't get clearance for logos. So they would routinely do that on set. They're like, oh, we need an extra. Like, who's around that we're already paying that we can just stick in the background over there and be like, nope, sorry. See, I'm wearing this dress. Giant Dr. Pepper T-shirt. Can't use me. But I had on a regular, you know, nice blouse. But I was wearing a leather jacket and boots and sunglasses and I was vaping and all that stuff. So I don't understand, you know, not to get sidetracked here, but I've never thought looking at you that you dress like a liberal. Well, I don't know. I think they expect the conservatives to follow the CPAC dress code guidelines at all times. Oh. Or look like I stepped off of a set of little hats. I don't know. And she said it was a hoot. And there was a whole contingent of Chinese ladies that were there wearing Chinese Americans for Trump. On the front, it was in English. And then on the back, it was written in Chinese. I assume Mandarin. Well, I hope that they weren't punking the crowd. But, you know, because I'm assuming they were thrilled. I mean, most people can't read Chinese in America. So. Oh, yeah. Nobody knows what was written on the back of those shirts. That's true. Well, it's like the dum-dums that get tattoos. I'm sure half of people that have gotten Chinese symbols have gotten something like, hi, I'm a dumbass. This is my tattoo. It's the Japanese symbol for wisdom. Courage. Oh, really? Because I can read Chinese and your arm says whore on it. It just says tramp stamp. I wonder if the Chinese have a word for tramp stamp. Oh, good God. So, yeah, you go check that out on Tracy's Twitter feed. Tracy L. Connors. And if you happen to see one of these people wandering around, be it a politician or a newscaster or whatever, just walk up to them. It can be done politely. Yeah, you didn't do anything. You didn't invade her space in any way. No, she came to me. Right. She came over to me and. And we're in a public place, so that's fine. She's got cameras. I can film her. So I didn't break any laws. And. Really good job, you know, being able to have your phone down at your side and get her face in on the shot. Yeah, I apologize for getting her face in on the shot. That's hurtful. Well, it was kind of frightening up close. It's like. But see, I was polite to her face. I didn't say, oh, Martha, did you leave your makeup people back in New York? Sweetheart, you're running around with college kids. You look ruddy. She looks like a Muppet. She does make a melted Muppet. Yes. But she looks like some some kind of puppet that that what's that comedian that that ventriloquist guy. Oh, I. Yes. Yes. Just like Jeff Dunham could have his arm up her ass while she's walking across the street. No, Hillary would do that for her. Her arm's already there. She cannot fit a second arm up her ass. But it was just stunning. To see that to say, you know, oh, no, I gave Hillary a hard time, too. Oh, please. Nobody thinks that, you know, and I could have been rude and been like everybody with eyeballs that saw that debate. Martha disagrees with you and people without eyeballs that could hear it would still disagree with you. But that's, you know, you don't understand Tracy Connors. If she's tough on Hillary, then she'll be Matt Lauer. And then at that point, she's not allowed to go to the cocktail parties and she'll be ostracized. By the rest of her journalism community. So she has to do what she did. But, you know, Chris Wallace, on the other hand, really doesn't seem to give a shit about that sort of thing, because everything that I've read, he's been getting rave reviews about, you know, over his performance last night. He did an OK job. But here's the difference is that he's already got to put up with being at Fox News. So I'm sure he takes a certain level of grief. But he's also legacy because of his dad. Yeah. So it's, you know, Luke Russert has given an awful lot of slack and he's nowhere as good and as even even handed as his father was. But there's no way Mike Wallace or Chris Wallace. Sorry, Mike was his dad. He's not getting disinvited to any of these things. That's true. And I think he is a liberal. I believe you're right, too. But at least he last night. Semi-fair. Yes, semi-fair. And, you know, lucky for him, the bar has been set so low. Yes. Yes. That just asking Hillary a few tough questions, people are going to walk away saying, oh, wow, he did a pretty good job. Sure. Sure. I he did let her skate on one issue that I was really annoyed about when he started a segment asking Trump about the women that have come out and accused him and then said, you know, and the follow up goes to you, Hillary. And I want you to address the accusations against your husband. And I think he said in the role that you played in all of that. And then she, of course, got to just walk away. Lambast Trump instead of answering the question. And Wallace didn't do any follow up on that whatsoever, which is a little bit disappointing. But it was interesting to finally have a discussion about actual issues. Yes. And stuff. It was bizarre. And there's so many things that still haven't been talked about, like criminal justice reform, the war on drugs, all these kind of things didn't come up at all in any of the damn debates. Now, was immigration touched on last night? I didn't see the whole. Yes. Yes. And that's the first time we're getting into debate three before they really come up. They really talked about immigration. And it just gets into a hideous back and forth, of course. And he nailed her. I mean, Trump brought up the WikiLeaks a couple of times. Wallace brought up the WikiLeaks. And in one of the WikiLeaks dumps, there were partial transcripts from some of her speeches to Wall Street. And in one of them, she talked about she envisions a world like a borderless world or something to that effect. And so Trump's like she's open border. She said it in front of Goldman Sachs or whoever was Citibank. I don't remember to whom she was speaking. But and she says and I went back and looked at the leak today because WikiLeaks did tweet out. This was the exact email referenced. If anybody wants to go look at it, they have it in their timeline. And in the next sentence, she's talking about, oh, I envision a world, too, with a green grid and renewable energy. So her answer to this is I was talking about power and, you know, sharing electricity across. Get out of here.

standing up there. We're in a beautiful like brownstone old building in Westchester, Pennsylvania, which is a small suburban town of Philadelphia. It's not close to the city. So I was a little bit confused why she was there. So I'm grabbing, like I'm stretching my legs, grabbing a drink and it was, the snacks were set up along the window. So I look out and I see a blonde woman with two cameras interviewing people. And I turned to the rest of the room and most of the people in the room were from conservative and libertarian think tanks and organizations. And I said, is that Martha Raddatz? And they all kind of looked at me like, who is that? And I was like, really? Am I the only person in this room that watched the presidential debate? And they said, I don't know. I can't tell. And I said, screw it. I'm going downstairs. I'm going to see. So I walked out the front door and she had been across the street. She was still over there and I got a fix on her. And I was like, yeah, that's her. So I just hit record on my iPhone. I did edit out the beginning of it because it's me just chatting with this other woman who came down to see what the heck I was going to do. We decided that, yes, it was her. And then she crossed the street and she asked me if I wanted to be interviewed by her. And then we had the little confrontation, which was pleasant. I was completely polite as I want to do. And yeah, if you want to check it out, it's still up on my Twitter at Tracy L. Connors. I asked her about her bias and she seemed to disagree with me that she was biased at all. And then she walked away. And part of me wishes I would have let her interview me because that probably would have been a hoot. You wouldn't have made the final cut. You would have had your film crew film her film crew filming you. Yeah. And you could have shown that out. Of course, you can also catch that tape on the Enough Already podcast page on Facebook. Yes, true. But I did share it up there. But on Twitter, I got a lot of love. I think last I checked, it had one hundred and fifty thousand impressions on that little. Unbelievable. It's just like I wish more people would do this kind of stuff. I can't be the only person that randomly sees people that have been dishonest on television consistently. And why not just walk up to them and ask them a question? Well, they're running around microphones in people's faces. But that's the way America really has shifted in the last, oh, I don't know, 25 years. We are for collectively. I'm not saying we all are, but the country has turned into a bunch of pussies who do not want to have any part of any confrontation whatsoever. They're turning off debates because people are too angry, too angry, Tracy. And the last question of a debate has to be, can you say something nice about each other? Can you please say something nice about each other? Can you tell Hillary she looks pretty in that outfit, please? It would do a good long thing for healing America. So apparently it's not in our DNA anymore to walk up and confront these people. I don't know if it's just a matter of that. I do agree that's a certain part of it. But I do think that there is kind of this mentality set in, especially with people that are on television. And I've seen this from my days of working in production and being around, you know, superstar celebrities. People feel like there is a difference between them and the people they see on television. Yeah. From a different class. They're from a different planet. Who knows? But they're just people. She's clearly smarter than everyone, Tracy. She's on TV. Of course. You don't want to confront someone who's smarter than you, who's on TV, who moderates a debate. I mean, she must be brilliant. Oh, yeah, you're right. Silly me. I should have just left her be. She could not have gotten away from you fast enough. No. No, I think she was totally thrown because according to one of my exes, I dress like a liberal. So I'm quite disconcerting to her. And I did have a nicer top on. I wasn't wearing, I usually wear like a logo T-shirt. And that was a ploy that I used to never be thrown into a scene as an extra because you can't get clearance for logos. So they would routinely do that on set. They're like, oh, we need an extra. Like, who's around that we're already paying that we can just stick in the background over there and be like, nope, sorry. See, I'm wearing this dress. Giant Dr. Pepper T-shirt. Can't use me. But I had on a regular, you know, nice blouse. But I was wearing a leather jacket and boots and sunglasses and I was vaping and all that stuff. So I don't understand, you know, not to get sidetracked here, but I've never thought looking at you that you dress like a liberal. Well, I don't know. I think they expect the conservatives to follow the CPAC dress code guidelines at all times. Oh. Or look like I stepped off of a set of little hats. I don't know. And she said it was a hoot. And there was a whole contingent of Chinese ladies that were there wearing Chinese Americans for Trump. On the front, it was in English. And then on the back, it was written in Chinese. I assume Mandarin. Well, I hope that they weren't punking the crowd. But, you know, because I'm assuming they were thrilled. I mean, most people can't read Chinese in America. So. Oh, yeah. Nobody knows what was written on the back of those shirts. That's true. Well, it's like the dum-dums that get tattoos. I'm sure half of people that have gotten Chinese symbols have gotten something like, hi, I'm a dumbass. This is my tattoo. It's the Japanese symbol for wisdom. Courage. Oh, really? Because I can read Chinese and your arm says whore on it. It just says tramp stamp. I wonder if the Chinese have a word for tramp stamp. Oh, good God. So, yeah, you go check that out on Tracy's Twitter feed. Tracy L. Connors. And if you happen to see one of these people wandering around, be it a politician or a newscaster or whatever, just walk up to them. It can be done politely. Yeah, you didn't do anything. You didn't invade her space in any way. No, she came to me. Right. She came over to me and. And we're in a public place, so that's fine. She's got cameras. I can film her. So I didn't break any laws. And. Really good job, you know, being able to have your phone down at your side and get her face in on the shot. Yeah, I apologize for getting her face in on the shot. That's hurtful. Well, it was kind of frightening up close. It's like. But see, I was polite to her face. I didn't say, oh, Martha, did you leave your makeup people back in New York? Sweetheart, you're running around with college kids. You look ruddy. She looks like a Muppet. She does make a melted Muppet. Yes. But she looks like some some kind of puppet that that what's that comedian that that ventriloquist guy. Oh, I. Yes. Yes. Just like Jeff Dunham could have his arm up her ass while she's walking across the street. No, Hillary would do that for her. Her arm's already there. She cannot fit a second arm up her ass. But it was just stunning. To see that to say, you know, oh, no, I gave Hillary a hard time, too. Oh, please. Nobody thinks that, you know, and I could have been rude and been like everybody with eyeballs that saw that debate. Martha disagrees with you and people without eyeballs that could hear it would still disagree with you. But that's, you know, you don't understand Tracy Connors. If she's tough on Hillary, then she'll be Matt Lauer. And then at that point, she's not allowed to go to the cocktail parties and she'll be ostracized. By the rest of her journalism community. So she has to do what she did. But, you know, Chris Wallace, on the other hand, really doesn't seem to give a shit about that sort of thing, because everything that I've read, he's been getting rave reviews about, you know, over his performance last night. He did an OK job. But here's the difference is that he's already got to put up with being at Fox News. So I'm sure he takes a certain level of grief. But he's also legacy because of his dad. Yeah. So it's, you know, Luke Russert has given an awful lot of slack and he's nowhere as good and as even even handed as his father was. But there's no way Mike Wallace or Chris Wallace. Sorry, Mike was his dad. He's not getting disinvited to any of these things. That's true. And I think he is a liberal. I believe you're right, too. But at least he last night. Semi-fair. Yes, semi-fair. And, you know, lucky for him, the bar has been set so low. Yes. Yes. That just asking Hillary a few tough questions, people are going to walk away saying, oh, wow, he did a pretty good job. Sure. Sure. I he did let her skate on one issue that I was really annoyed about when he started a segment asking Trump about the women that have come out and accused him and then said, you know, and the follow up goes to you, Hillary. And I want you to address the accusations against your husband. And I think he said in the role that you played in all of that. And then she, of course, got to just walk away. Lambast Trump instead of answering the question. And Wallace didn't do any follow up on that whatsoever, which is a little bit disappointing. But it was interesting to finally have a discussion about actual issues. Yes. And stuff. It was bizarre. And there's so many things that still haven't been talked about, like criminal justice reform, the war on drugs, all these kind of things didn't come up at all in any of the damn debates. Now, was immigration touched on last night? I didn't see the whole. Yes. Yes. And that's the first time we're getting into debate three before they really come up. They really talked about immigration. And it just gets into a hideous back and forth, of course. And he nailed her. I mean, Trump brought up the WikiLeaks a couple of times. Wallace brought up the WikiLeaks. And in one of the WikiLeaks dumps, there were partial transcripts from some of her speeches to Wall Street. And in one of them, she talked about she envisions a world like a borderless world or something to that effect. And so Trump's like she's open border. She said it in front of Goldman Sachs or whoever was Citibank. I don't remember to whom she was speaking. But and she says and I went back and looked at the leak today because WikiLeaks did tweet out. This was the exact email referenced. If anybody wants to go look at it, they have it in their timeline.
