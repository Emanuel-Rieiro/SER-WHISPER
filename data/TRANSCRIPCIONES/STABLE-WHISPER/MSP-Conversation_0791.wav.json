{"text": " I want to say about a year. It's been a long time since we had you. And, I mean, you're doing all kinds of stuff. You've never had me, Daniel. Come on now. You don't go starting rumors. Just because we were talking about coffee before anyone got on the radio doesn't mean you need to insinuate that none of you boys have had me. Almost got away with that, yeah. Yes. So, hey, what have you been up to for the past year or so? I mean, like I said, you do all kinds of stuff all the time. You're a Bitcoin activist and a Liberty activist and a radio host and now an author and everything. What have you been up to lately? Well, most recently I started a really exciting adventure that I have been kind of building, layering. I say that as opposed to planning because I didn't have a goal in mind that I wanted to work toward, but rather things that were happening in my life that just layered and met each other. I've traveled all over the country with my kids while I was homeschooling them. And so I've lived in like eight states or something between New Hampshire to California. So I wanted to go back and see those places and visit them now that my kids have grown and kind of just revisit that. Because some places we weren't for more than a year. But we met people and we became part of the community. So that was something that I wanted to do. I really liked the gals that I was involved with, with Bitcoin GNO, which was something that Pua Pailand and I started a couple of years ago while she was still active on Twitter as the Bitcoin wife. And that was an online chat that we had with women from four continents. There were 130 women that got into it a couple of years ago, but there were really only about 30 who were active. Who were involved. And I'd say out of that 30, there were 20 who were consistently involved. And then there were about 12 who every week we were talking to each other and we'd have cocktails and visit for a couple hours. And it was really fun. And although nothing really came of it in the US, Rheanne Lewis and Anna Kurth and Magdalena, who's known as Bitcoin Mama, she's there in England and Berlin. And they started this London women in Bitcoin that was an offshoot of the Bitcoin GNO. And those women still meet and have been at least every month. And every single month, there are more women that come and they've taught them how to make paper wallets, how to use a tracer, how to, they're talking, they're learning how to code. They're just, they've been, they've pulled the women in and really have done something with that. And so that's exciting. So anyway, I wanted to go kind of visit the gals. And then I also, I think I told you all how I don't, I don't have any income and how and why that is and, and why I choose to live below the poverty line. You know, I've never paid for a bullet or a bomb or a drone or a tank ever. That is definitely good stuff. Yeah. I not, not one. And so, but in order to do that now at this point, I, in order to avoid a tax, you know, implication and, and legally avoid paying into that system, I have to live. So right now I've chosen to take some, I sold something and I'm planning for the next two years at the most, but at least eight months to be traveling. And I'm living in a seven by 14 trailer being hauled by a truck that I'm calling my cozy castle. And I'm living on $500 a month. And which, I mean, to give context, like 15 years ago, I lived on 50,000 a month. $500 didn't even pay for us going out for me. So since you're not doing that anymore, can I take your spot there in that place? Oh yeah, no, I gave up. I gave up that life a long time ago. But the thing is like, you know, some people go, Oh, well, you know, that'd be hard to do. And it's like, well, yeah, I guess it depends on what you're used to. But, um, but I've been really disciplined the last 15 years on, uh, running my household budget and my life and stuff. So yeah. What's that like? I mean, what do you have to do? Well, I just started, you know, I mean, up in, for the last, I weaned myself for one thing in a big way. So for the last few years, I've been living on like, um, $3,500 a month. And that was, that was fine. You know, that rent and insurance and people go, well, that's okay. Sure. It's okay. Um, it's great when you're in your twenties, but you know, I've owned homes in several places in the world. I'm, I'm used to getting, you know, ski passes and having horses to ride and, you know, a life. That I'd worked really hard to have. And, um, so in any case, I spent a couple of years doing that, knowing that at some point I was probably going to have to make this choice to live below the poverty line. And fortunately, you know, with Bitcoin, I can supplement with that, but really what I'm focusing on is what I call beyond Bitcoin. And that is, um, kind of the theme of this trip I'm doing, which is, um, my, the theme's rather long, but it's kindness to kindness, uh, bar trading and bartering value for value. So, um, like right now I'm staying in a family's house and, um, I'm helping build a raised by vegetable garden and a chicken coop and helping with twin girls. And I cook dinner every night and, um, help with like, uh, it's a single dad and he's like kind of a man's man. And I'm just like, so things like, you know, setting up a sewing room for the girls. He just wasn't, he just wasn't sure how to do that and stuff. So in any case, I've been, you know, filling in, doing those kinds of things. And in exchange, he's doing, helping teach me how to weld carpentry, electrical work, um, to, you know, convert this seven by 14 trail. Yeah, it's really awesome. And then I have some, um, I'm going out to a shooting range. I don't know if you guys have seen my photos on Twitter, but, um, I've been, I've been doing a lot of shooting and, um, the owner of, uh, a gun range is going to, um, help me with some things and, and exchange. I'm going to be doing some, uh, some work for him, but, um, you know, and there are things that I wouldn't be able to do. Like he's got a three 38 Lapua. I don't know if you know what kind of gun that is, but it's like firing a rocket. And when am I ever going to have a chance? And, you know, I've never been a hunter or anything, so it's, it's an experience and I'm excited. Um, so as I'm traveling around, you know, people are so gung ho about, uh, making money and getting stuff. And, um, I have had a lot of money and I've had a lot of stuff and there's a real trap there. And I think that especially at this point when you're looking, at the milieu worldwide, even that, um, and, and the millennial age kids too, I have caught onto this is that, uh, there's more to life than stuff. Oh man. Oh yeah. You know, and we're seeing how you sure about that? Well, we're seeing how the, um, how the pursuit of the dollar has really infected the coin, uh, realm with, uh, a lot of toxicity. So, so that's what I'm doing now. And, and like, we can get onto that more, but I do want to make mention since we did talk a year ago and, and discussed, uh, at length, the Silk Road trial, um, and the abuse of power by Catherine, Judge Catherine Forrest against, um, Ross Ulbricht. And, uh, it's been a year. And since we talked, he was sentenced and he got what? Two consecutive life sentences. And, you know, I mean like all charges, including the Kingpin charges. And subsequently we found out that a couple of FBI agents were, I'm sure you guys have already talked about all this and your listeners know what it is, but, um, now there's a, uh, an art piece that's circulating around Twitter anyway, where you can buy, uh, tiles to reveal the photo that are the, um, what is behind the tile and it's an art piece that Ross did. And so that's a neat, so he's fundraising, like he's offering something of value besides just being a sacrificial lamb to everyone is forgotten, you know? Yeah. He's selling it for what? Um, you, you can go on and you can go to, um, freeross.org and you can see how, maybe, maybe you could put the, the link in the show notes. Oh yeah. Yeah. I absolutely will. I, I did see that a couple of times on Twitter and, and it, if we weren't, if we weren't doing the interview, that, that could have easily been a topic of, of a whole segment or something because it's so awesome. It's, I mean, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's, it's a piece of art that he did and you, you can pay, I'm assuming Bitcoin to, to reveal, you know, uh, there's, it's like divided into a grid and you can pay Bitcoin to reveal bits of this grid. And, and I guess the idea is hopefully it'll all be revealed. Not only that, but you can include a message. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's great. You can attach a message. Yeah, it's really, I love it. I'm so, so, so happy for Ross for coming up with this because, you know, he wants to be engaged and he's creative and he's smart and he's entrepreneurial and he's a libertarian, you know, anarcho-capitalist. And, and so he's like, even from a jail cell where he has nothing, he has nothing to look forward to. Nothing. There's no, when you're in jail, you have, there is no looking forward because the only thing that you ever look forward to if you're imprisoned is getting out, but he'll, he's never going to get out. Right. Right. Yeah. It's, it's gotta be tough. And I, I mean, I guess I know they're working on an appeal and I obviously hope it comes through and they figure some stuff out, but yeah, I completely agree. It's gotta be tough. The money that's going through, is that going to the free Ross organization? Oh, I'm, he's putting everything that he makes. Definitely. It's not going to be going to his commissary even. I mean, yeah, it's all going to his, his, uh, the appeal for his defense. No, Tim, Tim, he's going to use it to buy a yacht when he gets out of prison. Well, I mean, I was thinking that, or just a lot of hookers and blow, but, uh, anyway, uh, I just, so they are, they're going forward with the appeal now. Um, do you have anything new about that? Like any, you know, uh, Lynn Ulbricht, um, tweets about it and, and she's really good at keeping people in the, in the loop about what's going on. And it really, uh, changes every day. So I haven't really looked into what's going on for, um, I think two weeks now. And the last was, you know, we keep hearing stuff about the FBI more. Actually, I think it was yesterday. I saw, uh, I read something where there's more revealed about the corruption of the FBI involved in the Silk Road. Now you can, I think, I can say that to some people and they'd say, Oh yeah, big surprise. Ha ha. Well, that's supposed to be a big fucking surprise. It's supposed to be a surprise that the federal agents who are employed with the, you know, forced, uh, uh, donations by cause IRS income tax is voluntary. So your forced donations go to support, uh, uh, crooked, regime that is paid to, to hurt you and to take your property. And, and they're the punishment that the two men received who have already been tried and convicted. I think one got two years and the other got three years or something. Nothing, nothing compared to us. And they're in protective, like a protective prison because, you know, they're FBI agents and they get killed. The government's special boys. Yeah. Uh, but I mean, that's, I, I don't think you could really say you can't expect that, but I mean, we wish, yeah, we wish we could. I think some people are still surprised by that. At least that's the way the media put it out as is. It was a surprise thing. Um, yeah, I mean, that's like, what was the surprise that the, the, um, the DEA, uh, Mark. Yeah. What was his name? Mark Forrest, Carl Mark Forrest. Mark Forrest. The fourth. Uh, and then the FBI guy had, uh, had used it. What they were doing had used their position and their connections to steal money instead of just arresting people and kidnapping them. You know, about, um, I guess it was about eight months ago. This, um, man moved in. I was, I kept a room at my daughter's apartment in, uh, New Jersey. And so I was there, you know, um, off and on, but I had never seen this stuff. And, um, we, he, he looked at me like he knew me and I'm friendly and pretty approachable. And I said, hi. And he said, Hey, I think I know you. And I said, Oh, and he's probably in his early fifties, um, dark chocolate dude. And, uh, and I said, Oh, and he said, yeah, he goes, you're the lady that knows about Bitcoin. And that was not so surprising because everywhere I go, people, I talked to people about Bitcoin. So, you know, I mean, I walk into restaurants and they go, Oh, here's Bitcoin, you know? So, I mean, that wasn't such a surprise except for, I said, Oh, how did you hear? And he goes, Oh, I've just heard it around somewhere. So that was odd because that, you know, I'd never met him before. And, uh, it turns out he is a police detective and he asked if he could talk to me some time about Bitcoin. And I said, sure. And he wanted to come to my apartment. And I said, no, because you don't want to buy me in for a drink. I said, no. And he goes, why not? I'm like, well, because you're a cop, dude. So we talked out in the hall and, um, and I went ahead and indulged him, but it was really obvious within about 10 seconds that what he was wanting to know is how to commit crimes and get paid in Bitcoin. Dang. That's pretty crazy. Um, either that, or he works for internal affairs and was trying to figure out someone there or possibly to see, because the way the questions were worded, it wasn't as though he thought that I knew how to do it, but he was really, um, whether he was acting as though he was, uh, ignorant or he was in fact ignorant. He, um, he thought that you could, or he claimed, he said that you could, you know, use Bitcoin really easily to, you know, sell stolen computers that had fallen off trucks. And, uh, and I'm like, no, not really. If I was going to sell cash, right. I was going to sell a small merchandise. I use some of those bills that print up in New Jersey, you know? And, but, um, I said, they're not, that's not traceable. Um, whereas Bitcoin is, he's like, wait, what? And he was really upset. And he goes, what do you mean it's traceable? I said, well, it's, you know, you're, you're, it's pseudo anonymous. Right. Right. And so that was a really, that was a strange thing. And, and, um, I also, I was on match.com cause I can't get a date to stay in my life. Um, and yeah, and I got asked out and I kind of, and I matched with these three different men over the course of about six months. And I was like, wow. And I was really excited and everything. And all three of them, two of them work for the FBI and one of them, worked for, um, department of Homeland security. What are the odds? You got eyes on you. I fucked one of them. I was so horny. I just couldn't take it anymore. Like that's fine. I just have to. You fucked one of them. I did. Yeah. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, but the funny thing is, um, two, so two of them, uh, said to me, not that, um, the, um, department of Homeland security dude, but the other FBI just both said to me something really interesting, kind of off, like it was time strangely in the conversation, but they essentially both said that, um, or each said that I was harmless. Like, well, that's good that you think that, but no, it was just a really weird thing. So, so I don't know. I was, my, my daughter was actually the one that said, mom, are you seeing a pattern here? Yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy. I mean, it's, we hear about this, this rogue stuff, these rogue cops and everything all the time. Um, and, and I mean, I, I've never experienced it that close, but yeah, I mean, I guess they must be everywhere. And when, when you're somewhat well known like yourself, I mean, I guess that's who they, who they kind of try to glean some information from. And, you know, the Ashley Madison, is that how you Ashley Madison? Oh yeah. Yeah. That hack occurred, you know, shortly after my attempt at dating and, um, you know, so, and, and just before that happened, I was saying, oh, come on, no one hacked my match.com who cares, you know, da da da da. And, um, and then, you know, Ashley Madison occurred and, you know, stranger things have certainly happened, but it's, um, and then, you know, you know, now we've got the iPhone, you know, situation. And, uh, yeah, I think that, I think that people really need to take a look at where our world is going and rise up a bit.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.52, "text": " I want to say about a

It's been a long time since we had you. And, I mean, you're doing all kinds of stuff. You've never had me, Daniel. Come on now. You don't go starting rumors. Just because we were talking about coffee before anyone got on the radio doesn't mean you need to insinuate that none of you boys have had me. Almost got away with that, yeah. Yes. So, hey, what have you been up to for the past year or so? I mean, like I said, you do all kinds of stuff all the time. You're a Bitcoin activist and a Liberty activist and a radio host and now an author and everything. What have you been up to lately? Well, most recently I started a really exciting adventure that I have been kind of building, layering. I say that as opposed to planning because I didn't have a goal in mind that I wanted to work toward, but rather things that were happening in my life that just layered and met each other. I've traveled all over the country with my kids while I was homeschooling them. And so I've lived in like eight states or something between New Hampshire to California. So I wanted to go back and see those places and visit them now that my kids have grown and kind of just revisit that. Because some places we weren't for more than a year. But we met people and we became part of the community. So that was something that I wanted to do. I really liked the gals that I was involved with, with Bitcoin GNO, which was something that Pua Pailand and I started a couple of years ago while she was still active on Twitter as the Bitcoin wife. And that was an online chat that we had with women from four continents. There were 130 women that got into it a couple of years ago, but there were really only about 30 who were active. Who were involved. And I'd say out of that 30, there were 20 who were consistently involved. And then there were about 12 who every week we were talking to each other and we'd have cocktails and visit for a couple hours. And it was really fun. And although nothing really came of it in the US, Rheanne Lewis and Anna Kurth and Magdalena, who's known as Bitcoin Mama, she's there in England and Berlin. And they started this London women in Bitcoin that was an offshoot of the Bitcoin GNO. And those women still meet and have been at least every month. And every single month, there are more women that come and they've taught them how to make paper wallets, how to use a tracer, how to, they're talking, they're learning how to code. They're just, they've been, they've pulled the women in and really have done something with that. And so that's exciting. So anyway, I wanted to go kind of visit the gals. And then I also, I think I told you all how I don't, I don't have any income and how and why that is and, and why I choose to live below the poverty line. You know, I've never paid for a bullet or a bomb or a drone or a tank ever. That is definitely good stuff. Yeah. I not, not one. And so, but in order to do that now at this point, I, in order to avoid a tax, you know, implication and, and legally avoid paying into that system, I have to live. So right now I've chosen to take some, I sold something and I'm planning for the next two years at the most, but at least eight months to be traveling. And I'm living in a seven by 14 trailer being hauled by a truck that I'm calling my cozy castle. And I'm living on $500 a month. And which, I mean, to give context, like 15 years ago, I lived on 50,000 a month. $500 didn't even pay for us going out for me. So since you're not doing that anymore, can I take your spot there in that place? Oh yeah, no, I gave up. I gave up that life a long time ago. But the thing is like, you know, some people go, Oh, well, you know, that'd be hard to do. And it's like, well, yeah, I guess it depends on what you're used to. But, um, but I've been really disciplined the last 15 years on, uh, running my household budget and my life and stuff. So yeah. What's that like? I mean, what do you have to do? Well, I just started, you know, I mean, up in, for the last, I weaned myself for one thing in a big way. So for the last few years, I've been living on like, um, $3,500 a month. And that was, that was fine. You know, that rent and insurance and people go, well, that's okay. Sure. It's okay. Um, it's great when you're in your twenties, but you know, I've owned homes in several places in the world. I'm, I'm used to getting, you know, ski passes and having horses to ride and, you know, a life. That I'd worked really hard to have. And, um, so in any case, I spent a couple of years doing that, knowing that at some point I was probably going to have to make this choice to live below the poverty line. And fortunately, you know, with Bitcoin, I can supplement with that, but really what I'm focusing on is what I call beyond Bitcoin. And that is, um, kind of the theme of this trip I'm doing, which is, um, my, the theme's rather long, but it's kindness to kindness, uh, bar trading and bartering value for value. So, um, like right now I'm staying in a family's house and, um, I'm helping build a raised by vegetable garden and a chicken coop and helping with twin girls. And I cook dinner every night and, um, help with like, uh, it's a single dad and he's like kind of a man's man. And I'm just like, so things like, you know, setting up a sewing room for the girls. He just wasn't, he just wasn't sure how to do that and stuff. So in any case, I've been, you know, filling in, doing those kinds of things. And in exchange, he's doing, helping teach me how to weld carpentry, electrical work, um, to, you know, convert this seven by 14 trail. Yeah, it's really awesome. And then I have some, um, I'm going out to a shooting range. I don't know if you guys have seen my photos on Twitter, but, um, I've been, I've been doing a lot of shooting and, um, the owner of, uh, a gun range is going to, um, help me with some things and, and exchange. I'm going to be doing some, uh, some work for him, but, um, you know, and there are things that I wouldn't be able to do. Like he's got a three 38 Lapua. I don't know if you know what kind of gun that is, but it's like firing a rocket. And when am I ever going to have a chance? And, you know, I've never been a hunter or anything, so it's, it's an experience and I'm excited. Um, so as I'm traveling around, you know, people are so gung ho about, uh, making money and getting stuff. And, um, I have had a lot of money and I've had a lot of stuff and there's a real trap there. And I think that especially at this point when you're looking, at the milieu worldwide, even that, um, and, and the millennial age kids too, I have caught onto this is that, uh, there's more to life than stuff. Oh man. Oh yeah. You know, and we're seeing how you sure about that? Well, we're seeing how the, um, how the pursuit of the dollar has really infected the coin, uh, realm with, uh, a lot of toxicity. So, so that's what I'm doing now. And, and like, we can get onto that more, but I do want to make mention since we did talk a year ago and, and discussed, uh, at length, the Silk Road trial, um, and the abuse of power by Catherine, Judge Catherine Forrest against, um, Ross Ulbricht. And, uh, it's been a year. And since we talked, he was sentenced and he got what? Two consecutive life sentences. And, you know, I mean like all charges, including the Kingpin charges. And subsequently we found out that a couple of FBI agents were, I'm sure you guys have already talked about all this and your listeners know what it is, but, um, now there's a, uh, an art piece that's circulating around Twitter anyway, where you can buy, uh, tiles to reveal the photo that are the, um, what is behind the tile and it's an art piece that Ross did. And so that's a neat, so he's fundraising, like he's offering something of value besides just being a sacrificial lamb to everyone is forgotten, you know? Yeah. He's selling it for what? Um, you, you can go on and you can go to, um, freeross.org and you can see how, maybe, maybe you could put the, the link in the show notes. Oh yeah. Yeah. I absolutely will. I, I did see that a couple of times on Twitter and, and it, if we weren't, if we weren't doing the interview, that, that could have easily been a topic of, of a whole segment or something because it's so awesome. It's, I mean, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's, it's a piece of art that he did and you, you can pay, I'm assuming Bitcoin to, to reveal, you know, uh, there's, it's like divided into a grid and you can pay Bitcoin to reveal bits of this grid. And, and I guess the idea is hopefully it'll all be revealed. Not only that, but you can include a message. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's great. You can attach a message. Yeah, it's really, I love it. I'm so, so, so happy for Ross for coming up with this because, you know, he wants to be engaged and he's creative and he's smart and he's entrepreneurial and he's a libertarian, you know, anarcho-capitalist. And, and so he's like, even from a jail cell where he has nothing, he has nothing to look forward to. Nothing. There's no, when you're in jail, you have, there is no looking forward because the only thing that you ever look forward to if you're imprisoned is getting out, but he'll, he's never going to get out. Right. Right. Yeah. It's, it's gotta be tough. And I, I mean, I guess I know they're working on an appeal and I obviously hope it comes through and they figure some stuff out, but yeah, I completely agree. It's gotta be tough. The money that's going through, is that going to the free Ross organization? Oh, I'm, he's putting everything that he makes. Definitely. It's not going to be going to his commissary even. I mean, yeah, it's all going to his, his, uh, the appeal for his defense. No, Tim, Tim, he's going to use it to buy a yacht when he gets out of prison. Well, I mean, I was thinking that, or just a lot of hookers and blow, but, uh, anyway, uh, I just, so they are, they're going forward with the appeal now. Um, do you have anything new about that? Like any, you know, uh, Lynn Ulbricht, um, tweets about it and, and she's really good at keeping people in the, in the loop about what's going on. And it really, uh, changes every day. So I haven't really looked into what's going on for, um, I think two weeks now. And the last was, you know, we keep hearing stuff about the FBI more. Actually, I think it was yesterday. I saw, uh, I read something where there's more revealed about the corruption of the FBI involved in the Silk Road. Now you can, I think, I can say that to some people and they'd say, Oh yeah, big surprise. Ha ha. Well, that's supposed to be a big fucking surprise. It's supposed to be a surprise that the federal agents who are employed with the, you know, forced, uh, uh, donations by cause IRS income tax is voluntary. So your forced donations go to support, uh, uh, crooked, regime that is paid to, to hurt you and to take your property. And, and they're the punishment that the two men received who have already been tried and convicted. I think one got two years and the other got three years or something. Nothing, nothing compared to us. And they're in protective, like a protective prison because, you know, they're FBI agents and they get killed. The government's special boys. Yeah. Uh, but I mean, that's, I, I don't think you could really say you can't expect that, but I mean, we wish, yeah, we wish we could. I think some people are still surprised by that. At least that's the way the media put it out as is. It was a surprise thing. Um, yeah, I mean, that's like, what was the surprise that the, the, um, the DEA, uh, Mark. Yeah. What was his name? Mark Forrest, Carl Mark Forrest. Mark Forrest. The fourth. Uh, and then the FBI guy had, uh, had used it. What they were doing had used their position and their connections to steal money instead of just arresting people and kidnapping them. You know, about, um, I guess it was about eight months ago. This, um, man moved in. I was, I kept a room at my daughter's apartment in, uh, New Jersey. And so I was there, you know, um, off and on, but I had never seen this stuff. And, um, we, he, he looked at me like he knew me and I'm friendly and pretty approachable. And I said, hi. And he said, Hey, I think I know you. And I said, Oh, and he's probably in his early fifties, um, dark chocolate dude. And, uh, and I said, Oh, and he said, yeah, he goes, you're the lady that knows about Bitcoin. And that was not so surprising because everywhere I go, people, I talked to people about Bitcoin. So, you know, I mean, I walk into restaurants and they go, Oh, here's Bitcoin, you know? So, I mean, that wasn't such a surprise except for, I said, Oh, how did you hear? And he goes, Oh, I've just heard it around somewhere. So that was odd because that, you know, I'd never met him before. And, uh, it turns out he is a police detective and he asked if he could talk to me some time about Bitcoin. And I said, sure. And he wanted to come to my apartment. And I said, no, because you don't want to buy me in for a drink. I said, no. And he goes, why not? I'm like, well, because you're a cop, dude. So we talked out in the hall and, um, and I went ahead and indulged him, but it was really obvious within about 10 seconds that what he was wanting to know is how to commit crimes and get paid in Bitcoin. Dang. That's pretty crazy. Um, either that, or he works for internal affairs and was trying to figure out someone there or possibly to see, because the way the questions were worded, it wasn't as though he thought that I knew how to do it, but he was really, um, whether he was acting as though he was, uh, ignorant or he was in fact ignorant. He, um, he thought that you could, or he claimed, he said that you could, you know, use Bitcoin really easily to, you know, sell stolen computers that had fallen off trucks. And, uh, and I'm like, no, not really. If I was going to sell cash, right. I was going to sell a small merchandise. I use some of those bills that print up in New Jersey, you know? And, but, um, I said, they're not, that's not traceable. Um, whereas Bitcoin is, he's like, wait, what? And he was really upset. And he goes, what do you mean it's traceable? I said, well, it's, you know, you're, you're, it's pseudo anonymous. Right. Right. And so that was a really, that was a strange thing. And, and, um, I also, I was on match.com cause I can't get a date to stay in my life. Um, and yeah, and I got asked out and I kind of, and I matched with these three different men over the course of about six months. And I was like, wow. And I was really excited and everything. And all three of them, two of them work for the FBI and one of them, worked for, um, department of Homeland security. What are the odds? You got eyes on you. I fucked one of them. I was so horny. I just couldn't take it anymore. Like that's fine. I just have to. You fucked one of them. I did. Yeah. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, but the funny thing is, um, two, so two of them, uh, said to me, not that, um, the, um, department of Homeland security dude, but the other FBI just both said to me something really interesting, kind of off, like it was time strangely in the conversation, but they essentially both said that, um, or each said that I was harmless. Like, well, that's good that you think that, but no, it was just a really weird thing. So, so I don't know. I was, my, my daughter was actually the one that said, mom, are you seeing a pattern here? Yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy. I mean, it's, we hear about this, this rogue stuff, these rogue cops and everything all the time. Um, and, and I mean, I, I've never experienced it that close, but yeah, I mean, I guess they must be everywhere. And when, when you're somewhat well known like yourself, I mean, I guess that's who they, who they kind of try to glean some information from. And, you know, the Ashley Madison, is that how you Ashley Madison? Oh yeah. Yeah. That hack occurred, you know, shortly after my attempt at dating and, um, you know, so, and, and just before that happened, I was saying, oh, come on, no one hacked my match.com who cares, you know, da da da da. And, um, and then, you know, Ashley Madison occurred and, you know, stranger things have certainly happened, but it's, um, and then, you know, you know, now we've got the iPhone, you know, situation. And, uh, yeah, I think that, I think that people really need to take a look at where our world is going and rise up a bit.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 1.52, "text": " I want to say
