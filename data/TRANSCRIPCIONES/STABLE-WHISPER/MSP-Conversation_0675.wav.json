{"text": " Welcome to Caps Lock and Cray, a podcast for serious criticism and serious feels. My name is Vera, aka Caps Lock, and with me as always is Katie, aka Craze. Hi, how's it going? Hello. I'm freezing. How about you? Freezing. It is in the Arctic blast. What is going on with NYC right now? I don't know. It's cold. The Night's King is here and it's freaking cold. Yeah. It feels like negative five or something right now. But we're drinking some hearty Russian stout. Yeah. Russian Imperial stout. Yeah. Stone brewing. Yeah. It tastes like czars. It tastes like they taste. Yeah. I don't know. Well, okay. It's good. It looks like tar. It just, yeah, it looks like it can get you by when they wear their snow and you have to wear furs. Yeah. Like it's hearty. Yeah. It's good. It's good. I have gloves and a scarf on. I know. I wish I had furs. You're from Russia. I know. Why are you such a wuss? I know. I guess I'm the wuss one from Russia, so I don't live there anymore. It's too cold. It was too cold. Too cold. Well, there's been a lot going on this past week, right? Of trailers? Like trailers? Like, yeah. News trailers wise. Like, I feel like there were like 48 hours where it was just like nonstop, like something. Yeah. It was like, here, have a trailer here. I mean, I guess Super Bowl. Like the Super Bowl started it. Yeah. Really? Yes. Yes. You know, they have all their crazy trailers. And then I guess it's becoming that time where things are being advertised for the spring. Right. Which is like. Spring television. Spring TV. And then the movies coming out in the spring. Yeah. Everything's like ramping up and getting good again. Peak TV is happening soon again. Peak TV never ends. That's why it's Peak TV. I guess so. But I feel like. But the spring is. Particularly dense. Particularly dense for us. Like it's just rough for us because there's. All of our favorite shows are on in the spring. Like we have other shows that we love that are on all year round. But if you name all of our favorite ones, they're all on from March, April, May, June. The big ones. Yeah. It's insane that they are all. Like they. Spread it out. Spread it out. No. Make life easier for me, please. It's crazy. I have to say I do love. I love this insanity. That's good. Well, it'll be better this year for me maybe because I don't have any classes anymore. That's true. Yeah. Like that was rough. It was. Being like to school and working full time. There's not enough time in the day. But this week. For all the TV. This week, Thursday is becoming like crazy. Already three shows packed on a starting February 19th. Or 18th. With Vikings. Right. Starting the spring. Yeah. Season. That's first. Joining our Thursday night lineup of The Hundred and Colony. Yeah. Well, and Grey's Anatomy. Well, I guess. Don't be mean. I'm not mean. Oh, that episode. I guess we're not really going to talk about Meredith's stunt episode. We can't. It was so good. Well, we highly recommend everybody go on Hulu and whatnot or ABC.com and check out this Denzel Washington directed masterpiece. It was so good. Yeah. The Sound of Silence it was called. Yes. That's right. Because they did arty stuff. They did. With silence for a really long time. Yeah. For that show. Yep. Yeah. I like when they. I like when Grey's Anatomy goes arts. Well, trailers is what we sort of were talking about a little bit. Right. I mentioned the Super Bowl. Were there any trailers that stood out for you there? My favorite trailer from the Super Bowl. Sports Bowl. Sports Bowl. Was probably the Civil War trailer. Captain America. I would have to agree. Yeah. I was really looking forward to the X-Men trailer. And we decided to watch. We were like, let's watch the one that we were like least looking forward to first. That's not like. Let's watch the Civil War one. Yeah. Because every single time we saw Star Wars, we were bombarded with that first main official trailer. Right. Which was like, you know, you see it and then you see it again and again. Sure. Yeah. We'd seen it a lot. Yeah. At that point. And like, I love Captain America, but that first trailer was not playing to our particular interest. Yeah. In Captain America. So it was pretty rough. And I was like, okay, let's watch that one first. Let's get it over with. And I have to say that like comparatively, like the X-Men trailer for the Super Bowl was just real bad. It was. It wasn't. Yeah. It was not interesting. It looked like your generic run of the mill like superhero action thing where stuff was just exploding a lot. Yeah. And that's all it was. Yeah. I mean, it was almost like a TV spot where, you know. It was a TV spot. That's true. All right. So it was a TV spot and they treated it like one where. It's at that point when once you can have your movies enter the realm of TV spots, it's like, you know, throw everything at you without kind of any kind of artistic cohesion or anything like that. It was just like stuff. They didn't even try to explain the plot. It was just like things, mutants. Yeah. Meanwhile, the Civil War one, I thought was like way better even than the real trailer. Like it was kind of arty in the way like the way it was constructed. Yes. Which is always the best thing when a trailer is actually doing something with editing and with like the choices that it's making. And it made it such a clear understanding of what the plot was. Yeah. You know exactly what the like central dynamics and like antagonisms are. And then what I thought was, I thought it was pretty funny how they have the like hashtag like team cap. Oh, the hashtag war. Yeah. Yeah. Hashtag war thing. It's just like, I'm not, I'm not okay. It's called Captain America Civil War. And I mean, I know that I am not one to speak of what is actually going on because I don't, I don't really know because I haven't read it. Yeah. But it's called Captain America. So I'm going to be on team cap, I believe. It's weird. I kind of want to see how they present it. I mean, a lot of people seem to be on like people who you think would be on one side are like on the other side. And you're like, what's going on? Like, why is Black Widow with Tony? Like she's bips with Steve. Like what's going on? What's happening? Yeah. And like our new. That's why it's so interesting. It's like all these things you don't, you're very like, it puts things in front of your face that you're like, why? What's this? Like, that's why it's such a good trailer. You're just like, you need to know what is happening. And that's the point to get you like hooked in. It's true. Yeah. Our new OTP vision and what's her name? Scarlet Witch. Scarlet Witch. Are on opposite sides too. Oh man. I love Scarlet Witch. Yeah. And Hawkeye and Black Widow. All the couples. Even though they're not really a couple. They're not a couple. But you know, fandom thinks, yeah. Well. I think she's with Steve. They're also on opposite sides. I feel like Steve is my, well, yeah. Steve is the best. Everyone's with Steve. Well, you know, I once really, really complained about how everybody hijacked his movie. And then I got schooled about how it's like one of the biggest, you know, comic stories like ever. Well, I think that that's true. And it did like, at first when you just saw all the announcements, it just seemed like it was an Avengers movie because they're all in it. But again, as the topic at hand is trailers, each trailer for this movie makes it very clear in a non-worrisome way that it is Captain America's movie. Yeah. And I have to say like the sort of like, I don't even know if it's called political, but like whatever the central story that's making everybody kind of split into teams, I find really interesting. Yeah. And so I'm, that one made me excited for the movie. Another amazing trailer that, it didn't premiere during the Super Bowl, but it just came out recently, is the second trailer for The Huntsman. Yeah. The prequel sequel to Sawath. Yeah. Snow White and The Huntsman. Right. That looks amazing. This movie is, would you say everything? I would say, yeah. I think that movie is everything. This movie is everything. Do we need to explain it? It also has everything. It has, it has way too much. Yeah, go for it. Explain it a little. Well, so, I mean, it's confusing again because it is a prequel to Snow White and The Huntsman, which was the tale of Snow White, technically. Charlize is the evil queen. Okay. She is obsessed with the gold. Gold mirror. She has gold imagery and crows and tentacles of some sort. Sure. Magic. So her sister is now introduced as Emily Blunt, aka the Snow Queen. Ice Queen? Ice Queen, yeah. She's not Snow Queen. She's made out of ice. Yeah. And she's, I guess, what Elsa is based on. Seems likely. From the tales. From the tales. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And. High imagery. So, yeah. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the most useless character here, which is The Huntsman. And now joining him is The Warrior. Yes. Air quotes. Jessica Chastain. Jessica Chastain decided she wanted to do something where she fights. So she. The world's greatest lady. Yeah. She's the world's greatest lady. Does what she wants. And now is here. Yeah. So the second trailer, really kind of changed what the first trailer made the story out to be. Yes. This is, again, the power of editing. Because at this point, I don't know what the movie is about. Because the first. I mean, the second one seemed like what the movie is. As opposed to the original trailer. Yeah. This one just completely has a lot of explaining in a kind of fairytale story-esque way about what is going on with these two sisters. Yeah. And it was, yeah, it was totally different. Yeah. The first one. The first trailer, if you look it up, trailer one, made it look like the two sisters are joining forces to fight against, like, Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain and whatever their army is of dwarves, I guess. And the second one kind of explained that, well, there was this backstory where these two sisters, Emily Blunt had a baby and the mirror was like, that baby's going to be way prettier than you, Charlize, because she's just obsessed with who's going to be more beautiful than her. Still. And so she kills the baby. But killing the baby made her sister become the ice queen. Like, it unleashed her crazy powers. And then they, like, fought. Like, they seem like they're not together. Both movies seem great. Yeah. But I was like, whoa, this is different. And yeah. Cool. I'm excited for it. Yeah. Oh, my God. So when is this one? March. That sounds legitimate. I think. I could be wrong. Okay. But. It's just, it's so great to have this movie exist because it looks crazy. It has Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt, and Jessica Chastain. Yeah. This is the movie that Charlize got paid as much as Chris Hemsworth. Oh, good. Because he looks like an afterthought, even though it's called The Huntsman. He's so irrelevant in this. He is. Because Jessica Chastain is in it and Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron. Yeah. And that's like, that's crazy. It's crazy to think about that cast. It's like. And she rides a polar bear. Oh, my God. Emily Blunt is like, she's frozen on the inside and out. Her feels are totally iced over. And she rides a polar bear around like nobody's business. I love polar bears. And. And Emily Blunt. Yeah. Two favorite things. And we're very excited for this movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So moving on to TV, there's a lot of TV trailers that also premiered with the last. Holy shit. Last week. And honestly, we're recording this podcast a little bit before there's supposed to be a Game of Thrones teaser. So we don't know. But it's probably just gonna be like Jon Snow. When we have talked about the ones that have already. Yeah. Yeah. But since since vinyl is starting, they're gonna start hitting us. Tonight. Yeah. Today's Sunday. Hello. Hi, spoilers. We're recording this on a Sunday. But. So the first trailer that I have written down here is House of Cards season four. Oh, my God. House of Cards weekend. Upcoming. I have it blocked off in my calendar. All day. It's a little bit later. Two days. Yeah. It's a little bit later this year than last year. Everything is. Yeah. Honestly, everything is. Why? I don't know. What are they doing? Don't know. Well, I don't think we watched. I think we got into House of Cards when season two was like, you know, on Netflix. So it's not like we sort of missed out on kind of like the promos or whatever for season two. But I certainly recall. Season three. Yeah. And that trailer, which was to counting bodies like sheep in the night by a perfect circle is perfect circle. And I would say that this trailer. What? To the rhythm. To the war. Wow. I. What are you talking about? I was like, I count sheep in the night. So everybody does. Nice song about. Yeah. Like a little baby song, you know, sheeps. No, sorry. It's the other one. The war drum one. I was like, I know that title is a lot longer than what I just said, but it is a perfect circle. And that trailer, season three trailer is incredible. I would say it is kind of like a vid trailer. Yeah. Where something evocative maybe is said and then the whole thing is the structure of the whole thing is based around crazy, awesome imagery from the season to a crazy beat. Yeah. And it's like 40 seconds long. It's a minute long. It's definitely not like the first season trailer was two minutes long. But anyway, season four trailer would be the same where something evocative is said and then a crazy just beats. Crazy beats. Crazy beats happen and things are crazy imagery is edited to it in a very artistic way. They had some amazing the part where he does his like Frank knock on the table cut and then cuts right to Claire like picking up the phone. Right. It was. Very. They got some artistic edits in there. Yeah. Even though it's like all the flash transitions. Yeah.

a podcast for serious criticism and serious feels. My name is Vera, aka Caps Lock, and with me as always is Katie, aka Craze. Hi, how's it going? Hello. I'm freezing. How about you? Freezing. It is in the Arctic blast. What is going on with NYC right now? I don't know. It's cold. The Night's King is here and it's freaking cold. Yeah. It feels like negative five or something right now. But we're drinking some hearty Russian stout. Yeah. Russian Imperial stout. Yeah. Stone brewing. Yeah. It tastes like czars. It tastes like they taste. Yeah. I don't know. Well, okay. It's good. It looks like tar. It just, yeah, it looks like it can get you by when they wear their snow and you have to wear furs. Yeah. Like it's hearty. Yeah. It's good. It's good. I have gloves and a scarf on. I know. I wish I had furs. You're from Russia. I know. Why are you such a wuss? I know. I guess I'm the wuss one from Russia, so I don't live there anymore. It's too cold. It was too cold. Too cold. Well, there's been a lot going on this past week, right? Of trailers? Like trailers? Like, yeah. News trailers wise. Like, I feel like there were like 48 hours where it was just like nonstop, like something. Yeah. It was like, here, have a trailer here. I mean, I guess Super Bowl. Like the Super Bowl started it. Yeah. Really? Yes. Yes. You know, they have all their crazy trailers. And then I guess it's becoming that time where things are being advertised for the spring. Right. Which is like. Spring television. Spring TV. And then the movies coming out in the spring. Yeah. Everything's like ramping up and getting good again. Peak TV is happening soon again. Peak TV never ends. That's why it's Peak TV. I guess so. But I feel like. But the spring is. Particularly dense. Particularly dense for us. Like it's just rough for us because there's. All of our favorite shows are on in the spring. Like we have other shows that we love that are on all year round. But if you name all of our favorite ones, they're all on from March, April, May, June. The big ones. Yeah. It's insane that they are all. Like they. Spread it out. Spread it out. No. Make life easier for me, please. It's crazy. I have to say I do love. I love this insanity. That's good. Well, it'll be better this year for me maybe because I don't have any classes anymore. That's true. Yeah. Like that was rough. It was. Being like to school and working full time. There's not enough time in the day. But this week. For all the TV. This week, Thursday is becoming like crazy. Already three shows packed on a starting February 19th. Or 18th. With Vikings. Right. Starting the spring. Yeah. Season. That's first. Joining our Thursday night lineup of The Hundred and Colony. Yeah. Well, and Grey's Anatomy. Well, I guess. Don't be mean. I'm not mean. Oh, that episode. I guess we're not really going to talk about Meredith's stunt episode. We can't. It was so good. Well, we highly recommend everybody go on Hulu and whatnot or ABC.com and check out this Denzel Washington directed masterpiece. It was so good. Yeah. The Sound of Silence it was called. Yes. That's right. Because they did arty stuff. They did. With silence for a really long time. Yeah. For that show. Yep. Yeah. I like when they. I like when Grey's Anatomy goes arts. Well, trailers is what we sort of were talking about a little bit. Right. I mentioned the Super Bowl. Were there any trailers that stood out for you there? My favorite trailer from the Super Bowl. Sports Bowl. Sports Bowl. Was probably the Civil War trailer. Captain America. I would have to agree. Yeah. I was really looking forward to the X-Men trailer. And we decided to watch. We were like, let's watch the one that we were like least looking forward to first. That's not like. Let's watch the Civil War one. Yeah. Because every single time we saw Star Wars, we were bombarded with that first main official trailer. Right. Which was like, you know, you see it and then you see it again and again. Sure. Yeah. We'd seen it a lot. Yeah. At that point. And like, I love Captain America, but that first trailer was not playing to our particular interest. Yeah. In Captain America. So it was pretty rough. And I was like, okay, let's watch that one first. Let's get it over with. And I have to say that like comparatively, like the X-Men trailer for the Super Bowl was just real bad. It was. It wasn't. Yeah. It was not interesting. It looked like your generic run of the mill like superhero action thing where stuff was just exploding a lot. Yeah. And that's all it was. Yeah. I mean, it was almost like a TV spot where, you know. It was a TV spot. That's true. All right. So it was a TV spot and they treated it like one where. It's at that point when once you can have your movies enter the realm of TV spots, it's like, you know, throw everything at you without kind of any kind of artistic cohesion or anything like that. It was just like stuff. They didn't even try to explain the plot. It was just like things, mutants. Yeah. Meanwhile, the Civil War one, I thought was like way better even than the real trailer. Like it was kind of arty in the way like the way it was constructed. Yes. Which is always the best thing when a trailer is actually doing something with editing and with like the choices that it's making. And it made it such a clear understanding of what the plot was. Yeah. You know exactly what the like central dynamics and like antagonisms are. And then what I thought was, I thought it was pretty funny how they have the like hashtag like team cap. Oh, the hashtag war. Yeah. Yeah. Hashtag war thing. It's just like, I'm not, I'm not okay. It's called Captain America Civil War. And I mean, I know that I am not one to speak of what is actually going on because I don't, I don't really know because I haven't read it. Yeah. But it's called Captain America. So I'm going to be on team cap, I believe. It's weird. I kind of want to see how they present it. I mean, a lot of people seem to be on like people who you think would be on one side are like on the other side. And you're like, what's going on? Like, why is Black Widow with Tony? Like she's bips with Steve. Like what's going on? What's happening? Yeah. And like our new. That's why it's so interesting. It's like all these things you don't, you're very like, it puts things in front of your face that you're like, why? What's this? Like, that's why it's such a good trailer. You're just like, you need to know what is happening. And that's the point to get you like hooked in. It's true. Yeah. Our new OTP vision and what's her name? Scarlet Witch. Scarlet Witch. Are on opposite sides too. Oh man. I love Scarlet Witch. Yeah. And Hawkeye and Black Widow. All the couples. Even though they're not really a couple. They're not a couple. But you know, fandom thinks, yeah. Well. I think she's with Steve. They're also on opposite sides. I feel like Steve is my, well, yeah. Steve is the best. Everyone's with Steve. Well, you know, I once really, really complained about how everybody hijacked his movie. And then I got schooled about how it's like one of the biggest, you know, comic stories like ever. Well, I think that that's true. And it did like, at first when you just saw all the announcements, it just seemed like it was an Avengers movie because they're all in it. But again, as the topic at hand is trailers, each trailer for this movie makes it very clear in a non-worrisome way that it is Captain America's movie. Yeah. And I have to say like the sort of like, I don't even know if it's called political, but like whatever the central story that's making everybody kind of split into teams, I find really interesting. Yeah. And so I'm, that one made me excited for the movie. Another amazing trailer that, it didn't premiere during the Super Bowl, but it just came out recently, is the second trailer for The Huntsman. Yeah. The prequel sequel to Sawath. Yeah. Snow White and The Huntsman. Right. That looks amazing. This movie is, would you say everything? I would say, yeah. I think that movie is everything. This movie is everything. Do we need to explain it? It also has everything. It has, it has way too much. Yeah, go for it. Explain it a little. Well, so, I mean, it's confusing again because it is a prequel to Snow White and The Huntsman, which was the tale of Snow White, technically. Charlize is the evil queen. Okay. She is obsessed with the gold. Gold mirror. She has gold imagery and crows and tentacles of some sort. Sure. Magic. So her sister is now introduced as Emily Blunt, aka the Snow Queen. Ice Queen? Ice Queen, yeah. She's not Snow Queen. She's made out of ice. Yeah. And she's, I guess, what Elsa is based on. Seems likely. From the tales. From the tales. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And. High imagery. So, yeah. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the most useless character here, which is The Huntsman. And now joining him is The Warrior. Yes. Air quotes. Jessica Chastain. Jessica Chastain decided she wanted to do something where she fights. So she. The world's greatest lady. Yeah. She's the world's greatest lady. Does what she wants. And now is here. Yeah. So the second trailer, really kind of changed what the first trailer made the story out to be. Yes. This is, again, the power of editing. Because at this point, I don't know what the movie is about. Because the first. I mean, the second one seemed like what the movie is. As opposed to the original trailer. Yeah. This one just completely has a lot of explaining in a kind of fairytale story-esque way about what is going on with these two sisters. Yeah. And it was, yeah, it was totally different. Yeah. The first one. The first trailer, if you look it up, trailer one, made it look like the two sisters are joining forces to fight against, like, Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain and whatever their army is of dwarves, I guess. And the second one kind of explained that, well, there was this backstory where these two sisters, Emily Blunt had a baby and the mirror was like, that baby's going to be way prettier than you, Charlize, because she's just obsessed with who's going to be more beautiful than her. Still. And so she kills the baby. But killing the baby made her sister become the ice queen. Like, it unleashed her crazy powers. And then they, like, fought. Like, they seem like they're not together. Both movies seem great. Yeah. But I was like, whoa, this is different. And yeah. Cool. I'm excited for it. Yeah. Oh, my God. So when is this one? March. That sounds legitimate. I think. I could be wrong. Okay. But. It's just, it's so great to have this movie exist because it looks crazy. It has Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt, and Jessica Chastain. Yeah. This is the movie that Charlize got paid as much as Chris Hemsworth. Oh, good. Because he looks like an afterthought, even though it's called The Huntsman. He's so irrelevant in this. He is. Because Jessica Chastain is in it and Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron. Yeah. And that's like, that's crazy. It's crazy to think about that cast. It's like. And she rides a polar bear. Oh, my God. Emily Blunt is like, she's frozen on the inside and out. Her feels are totally iced over. And she rides a polar bear around like nobody's business. I love polar bears. And. And Emily Blunt. Yeah. Two favorite things. And we're very excited for this movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So moving on to TV, there's a lot of TV trailers that also premiered with the last. Holy shit. Last week. And honestly, we're recording this podcast a little bit before there's supposed to be a Game of Thrones teaser. So we don't know. But it's probably just gonna be like Jon Snow. When we have talked about the ones that have already. Yeah. Yeah. But since since vinyl is starting, they're gonna start hitting us. Tonight. Yeah. Today's Sunday. Hello. Hi, spoilers. We're recording this on a Sunday. But. So the first trailer that I have written down here is House of Cards season four. Oh, my God. House of Cards weekend. Upcoming. I have it blocked off in my calendar. All day. It's a little bit later. Two days. Yeah. It's a little bit later this year than last year. Everything is. Yeah. Honestly, everything is. Why? I don't know. What are they doing? Don't know. Well, I don't think we watched. I think we got into House of Cards when season two was like, you know, on Netflix. So it's not like we sort of missed out on kind of like the promos or whatever for season two. But I certainly recall. Season three. Yeah. And that trailer, which was to counting bodies like sheep in the night by a perfect circle is perfect circle. And I would say that this trailer. What? To the rhythm. To the war. Wow. I. What are you talking about? I was like, I count sheep in the night. So everybody does. Nice song about. Yeah. Like a little baby song, you know, sheeps. No, sorry. It's the other one. The war drum one. I was like, I know that title is a lot longer than what I just said, but it is a perfect circle. And that trailer, season three trailer is incredible. I would say it is kind of like a vid trailer. Yeah. Where something evocative maybe is said and then the whole thing is the structure of the whole thing is based around crazy, awesome imagery from the season to a crazy beat. Yeah. And it's like 40 seconds long. It's a minute long. It's definitely not like the first season trailer was two minutes long. But anyway, season four trailer would be the same where something evocative is said and then a crazy just beats. Crazy beats. Crazy beats happen and things are crazy imagery is edited to it in a very artistic way. They had some amazing the part where he does his like Frank knock on the table cut and then cuts right to Claire like picking up the phone. Right. It was. Very. They got some artistic edits in there. Yeah. Even though it's like all the flash transitions. Yeah.
