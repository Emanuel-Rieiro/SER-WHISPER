{"text": " Living as a displaced person is perhaps less about the country stamped on your passport and more about learning to live in the face of loss. This weekend, theater artist Elizabeth Huffman, who specializes in plays exploring global problems, directs a staged reading of a play called At the Periphery by the Turkish playwright Sedef Eser. Huffman is a Syrian-American director and actress living in Portland. At the Periphery deals with people who live on the margins of society. And while she never really stays on a particular locale, you could look at it as a refugee camp, you could look at it as a homeless camp where these people have makeshift homes. And they live on a garbage heap that they think is beautiful. Do you sense that the playwright left the location for this play ambiguous as an intentional choice? I absolutely do. And yet, for her, I think she wanted to say this could happen to anybody, this is universal, and it's not even necessarily refugees. We could go up to Lentz here in Portland and see the communities of a lot of people who have been made homeless by their displacement and not being able to afford the rising costs of living here in Portland and other reasons as well. You recently had the experience of getting a front row seat for how the refugee crisis is playing out in Europe. You were in Germany touring your one-woman show, Not My Revolution. The story juxtaposes a narrative of this woman who used to be a wealthy upper-middle class person in Syria and who finds herself all alone in a deserted building in Istanbul reading a play about Marie Antoinette. In this scene, we first hear Huffman as the deposed Marie Antoinette in despair and fearing for her life. And then she shifts characters as the displaced Syrian woman reacting to the fallen queen. Ha! She knew her Dante, at least. I always thought she was stupid and deserved what she got. Well, we all deserve what we get. Just look at me, sleeping in a rat-infested dump. Ah! My hair was full of lice in that camp. I swear I can still feel them in there. I scrub and scrub my head with that disgusting solution. Look what it did to my hair. It's as lifeless as I am. I simply could not stay in that camp a moment longer, so I left. They might come looking for me. They call this freedom? This isn't freedom. This is discipline. And perhaps punishment. I'm glad to be without a mirror. What did you feel these two women had to offer each other? Well, they have both been judged by the men in their world. They are victims of a brutal civil war, bloody revolutions, both of them. They both lost everything. And they were both in a class that you would not expect to have found themselves in that position. Anyway, we left the house. We were on our way to the gallery when traffic came to a complete stop. Thousands of people were in the street marching, singing, holding up signs, Oh, not another Arab Spring. Don't these people have anything better to do? This is so irritating. Now we're going to be late. We never paid attention to politics, except to make sure we knew which people in power to stay friends with, because loyalties in this country are always shifting. Can't you do something? Blow the horn. Get them to move. The displaced woman, I don't give her a name. I give her a title. Their fates are... determined by men. And how those decisions that the men have made for them, to have a revolution, destroys their lives. I actually begin the play by coming into the lobby with all of my belongings. And I ask various members of the audience to help me find a clean woman's shelter. Now I'm speaking in several different languages to try to communicate and the experience that I had in Germany where no one knew me. And the audience does not necessarily realize that you are the main character of the play as you're doing this. What was the audience reaction like? Well, it was shocking. There were people, the minute I came up to them, that yelled at me and said, I don't have anything. Leave me alone. And I was shocked and humiliated. Embarrassed. Terribly shy. Frightened. There were other people who tried to understand, who tried to help me, but in the end had to give up because they didn't know how to communicate with me. There were people... And I followed the audience in and ended up in the theater sitting in the first row. And people next to me were shrinking away from me. They had no idea that I was a part of the play. Until the lights go down and I end up going up on the stage and imagine their surprise. Especially the people that were unkind. Did any audience members during the talkback say what they had been feeling? That was possibly the most profound thing I experienced on this tour. And what made me feel that I need to do this play all over the world was one of the women who was most unkind to me stayed for the talkback. And she stood up and said to everyone, I am so ashamed. I am ashamed of the way I spoke to you. I will never do that again. I never took into consideration the way the refugees would be feeling. We're dealing with it every day here. And I had made up my mind that they were an imposition on my country. And I never saw the human. And that's why I do theater. During your trip to Germany, you spent some time in a refugee camp. What did you see there? Well, I went to what is called a container camp. And we were at first surprised that it was very... Well, it was very cold, but it was clean. And the first thing that hit us, though, was that it was completely surrounded with barbed wire. These people are not really free. There was a camp behind it that was not... In fact, I thought it was an abandoned garage. And there were people that were living in there that were refugees. And we were not allowed to photograph there. Because I think the situation for those people that were living in the camp behind was a lot more difficult. Rooms that were on hard, cold concrete in this old abandoned warehouse. They were separated by curtains from the family next to them. Everything they owned was in those rooms. And yet they were welcoming us in to please come in to their home with such graciousness. And it was incredible their ability to cope. There is no privacy. It's kind of in the same complex. They share kitchens and bathrooms and showers and stuff. What were the ways in which you saw them trying to capture something of home, even in circumstances like that? Well, the little tiny decorations that they would have in their rooms that were really packed. But they would bring out things. It's interesting. This is also something that my character... And based on interviews that I did my research on, they grabbed the most unlikely things. A teacup that belonged to their mother. That's one of the things that my character brings. Little tiny things that will remind them of home. Not the things that you would even remotely expect. And then, of course, their food. The food being a tremendous way that they held on to their culture. These people who have lost everything. To the camp with me, thought we were just going to have tea and cookies. And I'm like, no, I don't think so. They're Syrian. You're going to see more food than you've ever seen in your life. They're like, no, no, no. They're refugees. How could that be? What is it like to visit someone who is in a refugee camp and to find them insisting that they must give to you? It's humbling. It's completely humbling. You're prepared or you think you're prepared to be depressed. You're prepared to find yourself helpless and hopeless to make these people's lives better. And here they are turning it around on you and offering you a hospitality in the face of losing everything. And it makes you feel so humbled and so honored to have shared. For them, it's important that they share their hospitality because it's like normal. That is their way of feeling good about themselves.", "segments": [{"start": 0.42, "end": 4.68, "text": " Living as a displaced person is perhaps less about the country stamped on your passport",

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " Living as a displaced person is perhaps less about the country stamped on your passport and more about learning to live in the face of loss. This weekend, theater artist Elizabeth Huffman, who specializes in plays exploring global problems, directs a staged reading of a play called At the Periphery by the Turkish playwright Sedef Eser. Huffman is a Syrian-American director and actress living in Portland. At the Periphery deals with people who live on the margins of society. And while she never really stays on a particular locale, you could look at it as a refugee camp, you could look at it as a homeless camp where these people have makeshift homes. And they live on a garbage heap that they think is beautiful. Do you sense that the playwright left the location for this play ambiguous as an intentional choice? I absolutely do. And yet, for her, I think she wanted to say this could happen to anybody, this is universal, and it's not even necessarily refugees. We could go up to Lentz here in Portland and see the communities of a lot of people who have been made homeless by their displacement and not being able to afford the rising costs of living here in Portland and other reasons as well. You recently had the experience of getting a front row seat for how the refugee crisis is playing out in Europe. You were in Germany touring your one-woman show, Not My Revolution. The story juxtaposes a narrative of this woman who used to be a wealthy upper-middle class person in Syria and who finds herself all alone in a deserted building in Istanbul reading a play about Marie Antoinette. In this scene, we first hear Huffman as the deposed Marie Antoinette in despair and fearing for her life. And then she shifts characters as the displaced Syrian woman reacting to the fallen queen. Ha! She knew her Dante, at least. I always thought she was stupid and deserved what she got. Well, we all deserve what we get. Just look at me, sleeping in a rat-infested dump. Ah! My hair was full of lice in that camp. I swear I can still feel them in there. I scrub and scrub my head with that disgusting solution. Look what it did to my hair. It's as lifeless as I am. I simply could not stay in that camp a moment longer, so I left. They might come looking for me. They call this freedom? This isn't freedom. This is discipline. And perhaps punishment. I'm glad to be without a mirror. What did you feel these two women had to offer each other? Well, they have both been judged by the men in their world. They are victims of a brutal civil war, bloody revolutions, both of them. They both lost everything. And they were both in a class that you would not expect to have found themselves in that position. Anyway, we left the house. We were on our way to the gallery when traffic came to a complete stop. Thousands of people were in the street marching, singing, holding up signs, Oh, not another Arab Spring. Don't these people have anything better to do? This is so irritating. Now we're going to be late. We never paid attention to politics, except to make sure we knew which people in power to stay friends with, because loyalties in this country are always shifting. Can't you do something? Blow the horn. Get them to move. The displaced woman, I don't give her a name. I give her a title. Their fates are... determined by men. And how those decisions that the men have made for them, to have a revolution, destroys their lives. I actually begin the play by coming into the lobby with all of my belongings. And I ask various members of the audience to help me find a clean woman's shelter. Now I'm speaking in several different languages to try to communicate and the experience that I had in Germany where no one knew me. And the audience does not necessarily realize that you are the main character of the play as you're doing this. What was the audience reaction like? Well, it was shocking. There were people, the minute I came up to them, that yelled at me and said, I don't have anything. Leave me alone. And I was shocked and humiliated. Embarrassed. Terribly shy. Frightened. There were other people who tried to understand, who tried to help me, but in the end had to give up because they didn't know how to communicate with me. There were people... And I followed the audience in and ended up in the theater sitting in the first row. And people next to me were shrinking away from me. They had no idea that I was a part of the play. Until the lights go down and I end up going up on the stage and imagine their surprise. Especially the people that were unkind. Did any audience members during the talkback say what they had been feeling? That was possibly the most profound thing I experienced on this tour. And what made me feel that I need to do this play all over the world was one of the women who was most unkind to me stayed for the talkback. And she stood up and said to everyone, I am so ashamed. I am ashamed of the way I spoke to you. I will never do that again. I never took into consideration the way the refugees would be feeling. We're dealing with it every day here. And I had made up my mind that they were an imposition on my country. And I never saw the human. And that's why I do theater. During your trip to Germany, you spent some time in a refugee camp. What did you see there? Well, I went to what is called a container camp. And we were at first surprised that it was very... Well, it was very cold, but it was clean. And the first thing that hit us, though, was that it was completely surrounded with barbed wire. These people are not really free. There was a camp behind it that was not... In fact, I thought it was an abandoned garage. And there were people that were living in there that were refugees. And we were not allowed to photograph there. Because I think the situation for those people that were living in the camp behind was a lot more difficult. Rooms that were on hard, cold concrete in this old abandoned warehouse. They were separated by curtains from the family next to them. Everything they owned was in those rooms. And yet they were welcoming us in to please come in to their home with such graciousness. And it was incredible their ability to cope. There is no privacy. It's kind of in the same complex. They share kitchens and bathrooms and showers and stuff. What were the ways in which you saw them trying to capture something of home, even in circumstances like that? Well, the little tiny decorations that they would have in their rooms that were really packed. But they would bring out things. It's interesting. This is also something that my character... And based on interviews that I did my research on, they grabbed the most unlikely things. A teacup that belonged to their mother. That's one of the things that my character brings. Little tiny things that will remind them of home. Not the things that you would even remotely expect. And then, of course, their food. The food being a tremendous way that they held on to their culture. These people who have lost everything. To the camp with me, thought we were just going to have tea and cookies. And I'm like, no, I don't think so. They're Syrian. You're going to see more food than you've ever seen in your life. They're like, no, no, no. They're refugees. How could that be? What is it like to visit someone who is in a refugee camp and to find them insisting that they must give to you? It's humbling. It's completely humbling. You're prepared or you think you're prepared to be depressed. You're prepared to find yourself helpless and hopeless to make these people's lives better. And here they are turning it around on you and offering you a hospitality in the face of losing everything. And it makes you feel so humbled and so honored to have shared. For them, it's important that they share their hospitality because it's like normal. That is their way of feeling good about themselves.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.42, "end": 4.68, "text": " Living as a displaced person is perhaps less about the country stamped on your
