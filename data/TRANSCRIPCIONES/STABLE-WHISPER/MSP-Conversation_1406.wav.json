{"text": " And from Lynn Root, who is an SRE at Spotify, and she's been recognized for her work co-founding PyLadies. She's been a speaker at PyCon four times, recurring PyCon volunteer, and she's done just like so much, tremendous work. And some highlights from her talk, if you run microservices, you should be tracing them. It's otherwise very difficult to understand an entire system's performance, resource usage, among other aspects. However, good luck with that. Whether you choose a self-hosted solution or a provided service, documentation is all around lacking. Granted, it's still a young space, very much growing, but if there is an open spec that could be influenced or used to implement your own, if you're so inclined, basically like please help with documentation, consistent theme. I met Lindsay at PyCaribbean, and Lindsay had this tremendous talk on accessibility, and I was really moved by that to start thinking about that more generally. And Lindsay runs a Slack disabled in tech. I have to get the URL. It's on the next slide. So if you want that URL, tweet me. For inclusion of disabled people, a lot of conferences aren't captioning their videos when they post them up on YouTube, and a lot of venues aren't wheelchair accessible, and speakers throw around words like crazy. So I think that's one area we could all do a little bit better. And as for what's exciting about Python in 2018, it's the amazing growth in Africa of Python, specifically around Django and Django Girls. Africa is very much a place to watch for Python. And I have to give this shout out to Lindsay because I included some of that later in this talk, and that really came from Lindsay's inspiration. And Eva, the director of operations for Python Software Foundation. I love the inclusivity and kindness of the community. Every time I attend a local event or go to a PyCon conference, I feel motivated and inspired to continue to serve the community as best I can. My advice to those getting started in the Python community is to attend events and network. If face-to-face interactions are not your thing, I suggest joining a couple mailing lists or the Python IRC channel, also a great way to meet Pythonistas. And for folks who are introverted personally, I suggest giving a talk and then spending the rest of the time in the quiet room. That's what I do. Works great. People think, you know, like you've shown up. You have. You've totally shown up, and then you hide. You make other quiet friends in the quiet room with other quiet people. And if you want to find me later, obviously that's where. Or Twitter. Twitter is the quiet room also. It is, right? It's like me alone in my room. Well, okay, yeah. I guess, Twitter is the noisy drama room that you're in inside your quiet room, which may be why it's so confusing. So I was like, I thought this was quiet time, but everyone's yelling. Anyway, Marlena is doing this tremendous work, director at Python Software Foundation. And I actually need to interview Marlena, but found one of these quotes. Marlena says, I ran into one of the girls that attended one of our first Zimbabwe mentorship programs. She got into Harvard and is pursuing to computer science. I almost cried in front of her. It's so awesome to see Zimbo, Zimbabwe, girls doing well and feeling like we played a part in it. So I think the things that are going on in Africa for women right now are just, like, so tremendous. Very exciting. I spoke with Marietta a few times. And Marietta's advice to newbies in Python, the truth is, even after many years of programming with Python, I still feel like a newbie. And it's okay. You probably won't be good at it right away. Don't give up. The thing is, Python is not just code. It's a community. The community can help you participate and contribute. And to women in tech, please stay. We all need you here. And as many of you know, Marietta is a core developer at Python, to Python, and contributes to documentation, core workflow, Python.org. Marlena is a member of the board for NumFocus and says, the challenge we must solve is securing the needed support for open source projects that provide foundational infrastructure for national R&D. More advice for beginners from Olga Sandeka, co-founder of Django Girls. Do you have any advice tips for programming beginners from the blog? So you don't need to be perfect at the beginning. You will make many, many mistakes. And that's okay. You will improve. The best thing you can do is learning how to ask questions and how to not be afraid of asking them. I was very excited to come across Aisha's profile as I was discovering more about what's happening in Africa. She has this wonderful blog post on organizing Django Girls in Africa. And says, during Django Girls Lagos, a conscious effort was made to include women from other states in Nigeria to attend the workshop so they could go back to their communities and replicate these processes. It has been delightful to see this dream come true with Django Girls in these various places. I'm not sure the pronunciation, so please forgive me. Co-organized by Django Girls Lagos attendees. So let's give a round of applause for all of these women and non-binary people. And for all of the people here who are building this wonderful community. And thank you so much for having me. We'll take questions and a round of applause first for all of the people. And also, I would really love to encourage is if there's anyone who you think should be in the next version of this talk. Many of the people who are here now are because of suggestions that have come from the audience. And we're going to hopefully, I think, start some kind of wiki and get all of this online. Okay. We're going to go with curated questions as you liked. Thank you. So there's going to be a microphone over here. And over here, please come here to when you have a question or want to give a suggestion for names. Please. Just come up, please, so we can hear you in the recording. Have you looked at the Django Girls stories? Like Ola and Ola, from the very beginning of that, they were compiling. They have a blog. And every single week or month or something like that, they've profiled somebody for years and years. And I think it's still active. Oh, that's wonderful. You know, I've come across some of them. And I think that's actually a really good point. You're doing a really good job of that. Thank you. Anyone else? Yes, please. I've been doing Python for since five years, more or less. And one of the things I realized is how good it's with women, the community. Yes, it really is. And do you think that's my question is, is this across all technologies or other languages, other kind of technologies? Is it happening the same thing? It's across the board in terms of technology, in the technology world? Or is it something very special of Python? I think it's safe to say that inclusivity is not equally distributed in tech. PyCon is one of the more inclusive conferences that I go to. It's one reason I'm such a fan. And because PyCon is so core to the Python community, I think it's also safe to say that, you know, Python is a more inclusive community than some of the other spaces. I know certainly there are communities I'm in that are a little more hostile. You know, I don't want to name specific ones. And also, I don't want to discount if people are having bad experiences in Python, and I just don't know about it. But I can say that I've been going to, like, many, many PyCon events, PyCaribbean, PyCanada, following what's going on with the major PyCon event. And I think you can see, like, by the code of conduct signs that are being posted, the kinds of talks that are here and the people who are here, like, this is very special. And I guess the challenge is, like, how do we spread this more widely? And the truth is, you can't boil the ocean. So I'm grateful that we're doing a good job here. And hopefully, like, we can help set a standard and show that it's possible to do this so others can follow along. Yeah. And if there are other communities that are doing a great job, please do let me know, because I'd love to just be aware of that and also see what they're doing. I love Python, though. Hi. Hi. Great talk. I was surprised you mentioned Africa. I just got back from Nairobi a few days ago. And we had an intern in the office, Natasha. She's at Yale doing CS. If you're doing interviews, it would be good for her to tell you about her experiences. Yeah, I'd love a few people to connect us. I'd love to hear her experiences. No worries. That would be great. Thank you. And also encourage her. That's excellent. Yeah. Are there more questions, suggestions? If not, we can... We have one more? One more? Somewhere? If not... Could you come to the front? Thank you. Oh, wonderful. Just another suggested name for the slides is Margaret Hamilton from the Apollo 11 project. Thank you. She's one of, like, the top ten programmers who ever lived. Excellent. Thank you. All right. All right. So I will go, like, right outside to make space, you know, and clear this out. But if folks want to continue the conversation or ask me a question that maybe you didn't want to ask in front of everyone, you can find me just right outside. And thanks again for coming. I really appreciate doing this talk here. Thank you. Yay.

at Spotify, and she's been recognized for her work co-founding PyLadies. She's been a speaker at PyCon four times, recurring PyCon volunteer, and she's done just like so much, tremendous work. And some highlights from her talk, if you run microservices, you should be tracing them. It's otherwise very difficult to understand an entire system's performance, resource usage, among other aspects. However, good luck with that. Whether you choose a self-hosted solution or a provided service, documentation is all around lacking. Granted, it's still a young space, very much growing, but if there is an open spec that could be influenced or used to implement your own, if you're so inclined, basically like please help with documentation, consistent theme. I met Lindsay at PyCaribbean, and Lindsay had this tremendous talk on accessibility, and I was really moved by that to start thinking about that more generally. And Lindsay runs a Slack disabled in tech. I have to get the URL. It's on the next slide. So if you want that URL, tweet me. For inclusion of disabled people, a lot of conferences aren't captioning their videos when they post them up on YouTube, and a lot of venues aren't wheelchair accessible, and speakers throw around words like crazy. So I think that's one area we could all do a little bit better. And as for what's exciting about Python in 2018, it's the amazing growth in Africa of Python, specifically around Django and Django Girls. Africa is very much a place to watch for Python. And I have to give this shout out to Lindsay because I included some of that later in this talk, and that really came from Lindsay's inspiration. And Eva, the director of operations for Python Software Foundation. I love the inclusivity and kindness of the community. Every time I attend a local event or go to a PyCon conference, I feel motivated and inspired to continue to serve the community as best I can. My advice to those getting started in the Python community is to attend events and network. If face-to-face interactions are not your thing, I suggest joining a couple mailing lists or the Python IRC channel, also a great way to meet Pythonistas. And for folks who are introverted personally, I suggest giving a talk and then spending the rest of the time in the quiet room. That's what I do. Works great. People think, you know, like you've shown up. You have. You've totally shown up, and then you hide. You make other quiet friends in the quiet room with other quiet people. And if you want to find me later, obviously that's where. Or Twitter. Twitter is the quiet room also. It is, right? It's like me alone in my room. Well, okay, yeah. I guess, Twitter is the noisy drama room that you're in inside your quiet room, which may be why it's so confusing. So I was like, I thought this was quiet time, but everyone's yelling. Anyway, Marlena is doing this tremendous work, director at Python Software Foundation. And I actually need to interview Marlena, but found one of these quotes. Marlena says, I ran into one of the girls that attended one of our first Zimbabwe mentorship programs. She got into Harvard and is pursuing to computer science. I almost cried in front of her. It's so awesome to see Zimbo, Zimbabwe, girls doing well and feeling like we played a part in it. So I think the things that are going on in Africa for women right now are just, like, so tremendous. Very exciting. I spoke with Marietta a few times. And Marietta's advice to newbies in Python, the truth is, even after many years of programming with Python, I still feel like a newbie. And it's okay. You probably won't be good at it right away. Don't give up. The thing is, Python is not just code. It's a community. The community can help you participate and contribute. And to women in tech, please stay. We all need you here. And as many of you know, Marietta is a core developer at Python, to Python, and contributes to documentation, core workflow, Python.org. Marlena is a member of the board for NumFocus and says, the challenge we must solve is securing the needed support for open source projects that provide foundational infrastructure for national R&D. More advice for beginners from Olga Sandeka, co-founder of Django Girls. Do you have any advice tips for programming beginners from the blog? So you don't need to be perfect at the beginning. You will make many, many mistakes. And that's okay. You will improve. The best thing you can do is learning how to ask questions and how to not be afraid of asking them. I was very excited to come across Aisha's profile as I was discovering more about what's happening in Africa. She has this wonderful blog post on organizing Django Girls in Africa. And says, during Django Girls Lagos, a conscious effort was made to include women from other states in Nigeria to attend the workshop so they could go back to their communities and replicate these processes. It has been delightful to see this dream come true with Django Girls in these various places. I'm not sure the pronunciation, so please forgive me. Co-organized by Django Girls Lagos attendees. So let's give a round of applause for all of these women and non-binary people. And for all of the people here who are building this wonderful community. And thank you so much for having me. We'll take questions and a round of applause first for all of the people. And also, I would really love to encourage is if there's anyone who you think should be in the next version of this talk. Many of the people who are here now are because of suggestions that have come from the audience. And we're going to hopefully, I think, start some kind of wiki and get all of this online. Okay. We're going to go with curated questions as you liked. Thank you. So there's going to be a microphone over here. And over here, please come here to when you have a question or want to give a suggestion for names. Please. Just come up, please, so we can hear you in the recording. Have you looked at the Django Girls stories? Like Ola and Ola, from the very beginning of that, they were compiling. They have a blog. And every single week or month or something like that, they've profiled somebody for years and years. And I think it's still active. Oh, that's wonderful. You know, I've come across some of them. And I think that's actually a really good point. You're doing a really good job of that. Thank you. Anyone else? Yes, please. I've been doing Python for since five years, more or less. And one of the things I realized is how good it's with women, the community. Yes, it really is. And do you think that's my question is, is this across all technologies or other languages, other kind of technologies? Is it happening the same thing? It's across the board in terms of technology, in the technology world? Or is it something very special of Python? I think it's safe to say that inclusivity is not equally distributed in tech. PyCon is one of the more inclusive conferences that I go to. It's one reason I'm such a fan. And because PyCon is so core to the Python community, I think it's also safe to say that, you know, Python is a more inclusive community than some of the other spaces. I know certainly there are communities I'm in that are a little more hostile. You know, I don't want to name specific ones. And also, I don't want to discount if people are having bad experiences in Python, and I just don't know about it. But I can say that I've been going to, like, many, many PyCon events, PyCaribbean, PyCanada, following what's going on with the major PyCon event. And I think you can see, like, by the code of conduct signs that are being posted, the kinds of talks that are here and the people who are here, like, this is very special. And I guess the challenge is, like, how do we spread this more widely? And the truth is, you can't boil the ocean. So I'm grateful that we're doing a good job here. And hopefully, like, we can help set a standard and show that it's possible to do this so others can follow along. Yeah. And if there are other communities that are doing a great job, please do let me know, because I'd love to just be aware of that and also see what they're doing. I love Python, though. Hi. Hi. Great talk. I was surprised you mentioned Africa. I just got back from Nairobi a few days ago. And we had an intern in the office, Natasha. She's at Yale doing CS. If you're doing interviews, it would be good for her to tell you about her experiences. Yeah, I'd love a few people to connect us. I'd love to hear her experiences. No worries. That would be great. Thank you. And also encourage her. That's excellent. Yeah. Are there more questions, suggestions? If not, we can... We have one more? One more? Somewhere? If not... Could you come to the front? Thank you. Oh, wonderful. Just another suggested name for the slides is Margaret Hamilton from the Apollo 11 project. Thank you. She's one of, like, the top ten programmers who ever lived. Excellent. Thank you. All right. All right. So I will go, like, right outside to make space, you know, and clear this out. But if folks want to continue the conversation or ask me a question that maybe you didn't want to ask in front of everyone, you can find me just right outside. And thanks again for coming. I really appreciate doing this talk here. Thank you. Yay.

Every time I attend a local event or go to a PyCon conference, I feel motivated and inspired to continue to serve the community as best I can. My advice to those getting started in the Python community is to attend events and network. If face-to-face interactions are not your thing, I suggest joining a couple mailing lists or the Python IRC channel, also a great way to meet Pythonistas.
