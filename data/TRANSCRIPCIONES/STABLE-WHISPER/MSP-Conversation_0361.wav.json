{"text": " Yeah, I mean, that's good stuff. And the technology is not excellent yet, but it's getting there. And in five years, it's going to be amazing. It's going to be like before and after YouTube. It's going to be like that. Absolutely. Yeah, you know, there's all kinds of competing technologies right now that are platforms. They're really just a platform, right? So it's a matter of do people want to hear what you have to say? I mean, it's a real meritocracy, Rachel. Think about it. Yeah, the cream rises to the top in this kind of an atmosphere. So like, you know, when it turns out, like, what is it? What are you going to be successful? Right? Do can you entertain? Can you educate? Can you give people something that they want? And that really is going to be, you know, the deciding factor after that really is going to be also the technical issues, which sometimes have to do less with your actual message and more with how you deliver it. And what platforms you choose to use to deliver it. Like right now, you've created Liberty Me. And Liberty Me is what we're talking through right now. And it's like, this is a platform to talk about these issues. But when you talk about free speech and you're talking about the ability to communicate, mass media and stuff like that, you have to understand not only the medium that you're using, right? But you have to understand, like, what is the sort of like social atmosphere or the zeitgeist that gives the real platform, which is, do I listen to you now? Or are you an idiot and I close my ears? And sometimes people are just, you know, they're just idiots and maybe they don't know what's in their message. Okay, Austin. Donald Trump. That you are behaving like a true presidential candidate. And I mean that in a nasty way because you pivoted. You did not answer my question. The question, sir, was, what are you drinking? Oh, actually, I'm a Kansas City boy born and raised. So I was drinking some Kansas City Boulevard unfiltered wheat. The Boulevard Ale is the local, the Boulevard Wheat is the local brewery out here in Kansas City. It's a good Kansas City, good Kansas City company, a local company. Good. I love a good Boulevard. And I've been drinking Boulevard, man, since I was legal age to drink, which I, of course, would never break such a law. Are you legal age to drink? We know that you're not. I'm running for president right now. Rachel, I'm going to tell you. You want to laugh? I'm doing my job. You know what I mean? This is funny. I talk to everybody. I somehow tell people, everybody that I talk to, you know, I tell them that I'm running for president. Whether I meet them in a bar or whether I'm on the street or something like that, I somehow manage, because I like to trick people, play with people, right? It's fun. It's not trick people, but it's like if you meet an old lady, you know, in the checkout aisle, right, or you meet a girl for you, how can you fit it in? I kind of tease my, tease it out. How can I explain to people? Because when people realize that I'm serious, you know, they're usually like, because usually somebody who would say something like that is like, oh, you're a crazy person. They instantly want to know. I never heard of this guy, so he must be nuts, right? You're totally making me want to run for president now, just so I can play that game. That sounds fun. Why not? You know, I mean, like, there are a lot of candidates in this race, and that's what makes it so interesting, because never before have there been so many interesting options. And some people say they've made up their minds. You know, I don't believe that. Polls are skewed. They're always, it doesn't matter what the polls say today, because they'll say, say something else tomorrow. So, I mean, Christopher Hitchens had a great quote about polls, a couple of great polls. One was that polls aren't really commissioned to tell you what people think as much as they're to tell people how to think. Hmm, interesting. Which, you know, because here's the thing, the mainstream media, think about it. Normal people don't poll. They don't even have polls. Who needs polls? Rich people who have special interests have polls. They spend money, you know, why would a normal person who's like a wealthy person or, you know, commissioner poll? That's true. Some people do do polls for, like, you know, certain types of marketing and stuff like that. And so, you know, George Soros or the Koch brothers, they, you know, look at the marketplace for their seller ideas. Go ahead and come on through. Can't see you. Sorry, we're still there. This is a very casual show. No problem. Bring them on air. I don't care. Where were we? Polls. Polls. And you, I think you were making the point that everyone who does polls is, like, has a bias, has an interest. I disagree. I disagree because there are certain pollsters that are in the business of being right. And if they're wrong after the fact too many times, then they lose credibility. So there is a segment of pollsters that are like that. They are totally nonpartisan and you should believe them. But I think the trick is you've got to learn how to tell the difference. You've got to understand who is commissioning the poll. Asking a lot, Rachel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is why libertarians who are, like, egalitarians really get to me because I'm like, you're the elite. You know, you're the one. Whoa. Wow. What's she drinking? We've had a lot tonight. Hey, we're celebrating because, like, we're having fun. And Rachel, you know, like, if everybody doesn't know, like, you know, here's my voice right here in my mouth. You can cross from me. We are the revolution. You know, like, the Ron Paul revolution that we started in 2007, 2008. I will never forget. Can I tell the story? Can I divert? Sorry, I don't want to be a politician here. Okay. Rachel and I, the first time that Rachel and I really met, I saw her at CPAC the first time. We didn't speak. She was with Ron Paul. I was starstruck. Ron was my hero. And then I saw her again when I was bringing petitions. I was working with the Libertarian Party and I was bringing petitions around to help support Ron Paul's audit of the Fed bill. And this would have been two years ago. 2008-ish, you know. And I saw Rachel and Rachel was the chief comms director for Ron Paul. And so I thought she was pretty much the coolest person ever. I totally am. You're right about that. But I was going to play it cool. And, you know, I wanted, I had met Ron before, but I wanted, you know, I wanted my interns to meet him and, you know, have them to be excited. I wanted to support this legislative effort. And I remember Rachel spoke to me for the first time and she stopped me afterwards, after we all spoke to Ron and the interns had freaked out. We had the best day of our lives, basically. And we delivered our petitions and dinners. Civic activism. Democracy. Small d. Rachel came and grabbed my arm and she said, I haven't got your business card. And I gave her my business card. And ever since then, Rachel and I have been friends. And now she's my communications director for my presidential campaign, my own presidential campaign. And because she knows that I'm serious and we're trying to accomplish things. I hope the people who are listening to this show right now know that, like, you know, sincere warriors, sincere liberty warriors and champions. I'll tell you my favorite thing. Favorite Austin Peterson memory is when you came out to play poker with us at the Carlisle Club. It's the Carlisle Club. Yeah. That was actually one of my favorite nights ever. Yeah, we, yeah, we became regulars. I actually helped them out with some marketing and finagle us some, you know, benefits so that we could go see. Oh, yeah. That's, that's totally our, that's, that's our, that's our jam. So, yeah. We love the Carlisle Club. We love Doc Scantlin and the Imperial Palms Orchestra. And I so wish we could spend another New Year's with them. But if you're in the D.C. area and you have the opportunity, highly recommend it. They're like Rainbow Room. They used to play the Rainbow Room for New Year's Eve. That's how awesome they are. And I know you know what that means. You know, you know. Studio 54. Yeah, but the, yeah, the Rainbow Room on New Year's Eve. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I'm so excited about what we're doing together. I don't mean to divert the show again, but I mean, I'm so excited about what's happening. The possibilities. Yeah. You gotta have options. You know what I mean? Like, I love Rand. Can we talk about Rand? Can we, please? We should totally talk about Rand because I think, I think a lot of people are, well, you, you, you start. You start. Oh, but first, I have to answer the question. We always start the show with, what are you drinking? And after I say what I'm drinking, because what I'm drinking is important. I have a Best Mom Ever wine glass because, yeah, because that's, that's how I roll. And I am drinking a Carlo Rossi Burgundy because that's what Jeffrey Tucker recommended. And I've become addicted to it now. So Carlo Rossi Burgundy and a Best Mom Ever wine glass that I bought. I bought for myself. Okay. Rand, let's talk about Rand. Oh, honey, I'm so worried for him. I just like, you know, my, my own party gives me hell because I, I say nice things about him. But I mean, like, you know, Mike Lee, I love Mike Lee, but he's got, he's got a lot of bad stuff about him. You know, Ted Cruz. Mike, Mike Lee is on my shit list because he co-sponsored the, um, the gambling. Yeah. You know why too? They're all sellouts. Because he's in, he's in Sheldon Adelson's pocket. I know, but Rand is like the least cellist outesty. What? He's like the least cellist outesty. That's my new favorite word. Cellist outesty. Marco Rubio called him out on the debate the other night about, um, his, his immigration bill as affecting people who are, have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. And I just, here's the thing. If, if you're going to lose, fight, fight for the, for the, for the purity, for fight for the end. I'm not a purist. I'm not a purist. But when my, when my, when I know I might lose, if you follow Sun Tzu's teachings and you go crazy bastard strategy, you know, like you're willing to nuclear destroy, you know, mutually assured destruction, then, you know, all of a sudden you're in Trump territory in terms of polls. But I mean, that's just tactics. You know, I think Rand does believe, I honestly think Rand does believe a lot of, probably most of everything that his father believes in many ways. Rand was always there with Murray, you know, and, and our guys, you know, I'm more of a Robert Nozick guy, but we're a big movement. And, you know, Ron and Rand play their part in this. Not, they're not the end all be all. Now let's talk about this, the cult of Paul. Let's talk about the cult of Paul, Rachel, because you're, you're a Paulista. You're a Paulistinian. You know, look for the man. I never could. I'm Pollyanna. I'm independent. I've never taken a dime of money from Rand or Ron. And I probably put in, you know, $150,000 at least worth of work. I've taken, I've taken a lot of money from them, but it's all been taxpayer money. So that should endear me to all the libertarians. So now you're giving it back to them. Yeah. The cult of Paul, and we need to discuss this because like, you always say, why is our time so uncomfortable? It's the uncomfortable stuff that gets the dialogue going so we can move forward our principles, not the stuff that we all agree on. But the stuff we disagree on that makes this important, because I think we've gotten so much into a cult of personality that like, we can't get out of this mindset that maybe a libertarian candidate isn't like a sweet old man, you know, like gentle, pacifistic sort of an old man. This is a strain of libertarian-esque, this paleo-libertarianism and what Rothbard and Lou Rockwell and these men created in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. So, but it's exclusionary to the young secular humanist, the skeptical libertarian, the Penn Jillette libertarian, Penn and Teller libertarian, like myself, for example, the scientific secular humanist libertarian that agrees with Ron Paul on almost everything, but perhaps religion and some other things like immigration. But the Kochs, the Kochs are big free market libertarians. Yeah. So the cult of personality, I think, limits us. And I want to, you know, do you agree? Do you think there's, do you think that there is a cult of personality that limits? Yeah. Yeah, I absolutely do agree. And actually what I think is, is that Ron Paul never wanted a cult of personality. Here, Jesus. He never wanted it. No, he didn't like it. And I could see him getting uncomfortable with the popularity in certain ways. Yeah. I mean, it's the most awkward thing in the world. It was the most awkward thing in the world for me to watch these young kids come up and give him a hug. I understand like where it came from, but like that just wasn't his personality to want to be all touchy feely. I think he, he only gave me one hug in my life and that was a hug goodbye. My last day out of the office. I'm going to cry. No, I'm not going to cry. But he's just not a touchy feely kind of guy. And he's not, he's not into that. That's why this article, this weird article that came out this week. I don't know if you saw that, that there was some kind of friction and jealousy between Randall and Paul. And, and Ron, it just, it, it, it. You're trying to divide us. I see them out there. It totally did not ring true to me because there was. Was that the buzz? Was that the, the, the blaze, the blaze guy from Buzzfeed? Yeah. Yeah. And, and I heard talking about this. So it's, it's out there. People are talking about this rumor and like, oh, it has inside information legs to it. And it's like, it doesn't ring true to me because there is no ego to Ron Paul. There really isn't. And I, I don't, I don't think people are, people really understand that, but like, there's no ego. It's not even possible that that. None of it made any sense to me. I've stepped down from the libertarian Republic. My, as like editor to try and like have a magazine that's, that's objective, at least as objective as it can be with the fact that I own it. Cause I try, you know, I believe in integrity. And, and we, you know, my writers love Randall. They love Randall. They love Ron. And of course they love me. And so that, but like, I've told them, I've said, you don't cover me or my campaign until I'm the news, you know, and until it's, until the, until it's important part of our libertarian story. Otherwise, you know, they're writing about Rand and like, you know, there's an internal struggle going on in between them, between like, you know, the skepticism that the chances that he might win and like what they are, but, but there's not a doubt that, that, that our liberal, that our movement has cohesiveness and, and that, that there are powers working against us to divide us. And like, you know, I try and be a good shepherd for them in order to sort of guide them. We really do need to be a big tent. That's, that's, that's important because divided, we accomplish nothing. Yeah. But I mean, there, there are many fronts to the war and everybody just pick a front and fight on that front and don't fight about whose front is better. Just keep fighting. Just do what you do and, and support each other. And, you know, if we could just do that and it sounds so simple, but, but every organization, the best class I ever took in college was organizational behavior. And it's all about psychology and groups and how, how people fight in fighting and power struggles. And so fascinating. But yeah, every organization has these kinds of struggles.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.1, "text": " Yeah,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [865, 11], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob":

{"text": " Yeah, I mean, that's good stuff. And the technology is not excellent yet, but it's getting there. And in five years, it's going to be amazing. It's going to be like before and after YouTube. It's going to be like that. Absolutely. Yeah, you know, there's all kinds of competing technologies right now that are platforms. They're really just a platform, right? So it's a matter of do people want to hear what you have to say? I mean, it's a real meritocracy, Rachel. Think about it. Yeah, the cream rises to the top in this kind of an atmosphere. So like, you know, when it turns out, like, what is it? What are you going to be successful? Right? Do can you entertain? Can you educate? Can you give people something that they want? And that really is going to be, you know, the deciding factor after that really is going to be also the technical issues, which sometimes have to do less with your actual message and more with how you deliver it. And what platforms you choose to use to deliver it. Like right now, you've created Liberty Me. And Liberty Me is what we're talking through right now. And it's like, this is a platform to talk about these issues. But when you talk about free speech and you're talking about the ability to communicate, mass media and stuff like that, you have to understand not only the medium that you're using, right? But you have to understand, like, what is the sort of like social atmosphere or the zeitgeist that gives the real platform, which is, do I listen to you now? Or are you an idiot and I close my ears? And sometimes people are just, you know, they're just idiots and maybe they don't know what's in their message. Okay, Austin. Donald Trump. That you are behaving like a true presidential candidate. And I mean that in a nasty way because you pivoted. You did not answer my question. The question, sir, was, what are you drinking? Oh, actually, I'm a Kansas City boy born and raised. So I was drinking some Kansas City Boulevard unfiltered wheat. The Boulevard Ale is the local, the Boulevard Wheat is the local brewery out here in Kansas City. It's a good Kansas City, good Kansas City company, a local company. Good. I love a good Boulevard. And I've been drinking Boulevard, man, since I was legal age to drink, which I, of course, would never break such a law. Are you legal age to drink? We know that you're not. I'm running for president right now. Rachel, I'm going to tell you. You want to laugh? I'm doing my job. You know what I mean? This is funny. I talk to everybody. I somehow tell people, everybody that I talk to, you know, I tell them that I'm running for president. Whether I meet them in a bar or whether I'm on the street or something like that, I somehow manage, because I like to trick people, play with people, right? It's fun. It's not trick people, but it's like if you meet an old lady, you know, in the checkout aisle, right, or you meet a girl for you, how can you fit it in? I kind of tease my, tease it out. How can I explain to people? Because when people realize that I'm serious, you know, they're usually like, because usually somebody who would say something like that is like, oh, you're a crazy person. They instantly want to know. I never heard of this guy, so he must be nuts, right? You're totally making me want to run for president now, just so I can play that game. That sounds fun. Why not? You know, I mean, like, there are a lot of candidates in this race, and that's what makes it so interesting, because never before have there been so many interesting options. And some people say they've made up their minds. You know, I don't believe that. Polls are skewed. They're always, it doesn't matter what the polls say today, because they'll say, say something else tomorrow. So, I mean, Christopher Hitchens had a great quote about polls, a couple of great polls. One was that polls aren't really commissioned to tell you what people think as much as they're to tell people how to think. Hmm, interesting. Which, you know, because here's the thing, the mainstream media, think about it. Normal people don't poll. They don't even have polls. Who needs polls? Rich people who have special interests have polls. They spend money, you know, why would a normal person who's like a wealthy person or, you know, commissioner poll? That's true. Some people do do polls for, like, you know, certain types of marketing and stuff like that. And so, you know, George Soros or the Koch brothers, they, you know, look at the marketplace for their seller ideas. Go ahead and come on through. Can't see you. Sorry, we're still there. This is a very casual show. No problem. Bring them on air. I don't care. Where were we? Polls. Polls. And you, I think you were making the point that everyone who does polls is, like, has a bias, has an interest. I disagree. I disagree because there are certain pollsters that are in the business of being right. And if they're wrong after the fact too many times, then they lose credibility. So there is a segment of pollsters that are like that. They are totally nonpartisan and you should believe them. But I think the trick is you've got to learn how to tell the difference. You've got to understand who is commissioning the poll. Asking a lot, Rachel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is why libertarians who are, like, egalitarians really get to me because I'm like, you're the elite. You know, you're the one. Whoa. Wow. What's she drinking? We've had a lot tonight. Hey, we're celebrating because, like, we're having fun. And Rachel, you know, like, if everybody doesn't know, like, you know, here's my voice right here in my mouth. You can cross from me. We are the revolution. You know, like, the Ron Paul revolution that we started in 2007, 2008. I will never forget. Can I tell the story? Can I divert? Sorry, I don't want to be a politician here. Okay. Rachel and I, the first time that Rachel and I really met, I saw her at CPAC the first time. We didn't speak. She was with Ron Paul. I was starstruck. Ron was my hero. And then I saw her again when I was bringing petitions. I was working with the Libertarian Party and I was bringing petitions around to help support Ron Paul's audit of the Fed bill. And this would have been two years ago. 2008-ish, you know. And I saw Rachel and Rachel was the chief comms director for Ron Paul. And so I thought she was pretty much the coolest person ever. I totally am. You're right about that. But I was going to play it cool. And, you know, I wanted, I had met Ron before, but I wanted, you know, I wanted my interns to meet him and, you know, have them to be excited. I wanted to support this legislative effort. And I remember Rachel spoke to me for the first time and she stopped me afterwards, after we all spoke to Ron and the interns had freaked out. We had the best day of our lives, basically. And we delivered our petitions and dinners. Civic activism. Democracy. Small d. Rachel came and grabbed my arm and she said, I haven't got your business card. And I gave her my business card. And ever since then, Rachel and I have been friends. And now she's my communications director for my presidential campaign, my own presidential campaign. And because she knows that I'm serious and we're trying to accomplish things. I hope the people who are listening to this show right now know that, like, you know, sincere warriors, sincere liberty warriors and champions. I'll tell you my favorite thing. Favorite Austin Peterson memory is when you came out to play poker with us at the Carlisle Club. It's the Carlisle Club. Yeah. That was actually one of my favorite nights ever. Yeah, we, yeah, we became regulars. I actually helped them out with some marketing and finagle us some, you know, benefits so that we could go see. Oh, yeah. That's, that's totally our, that's, that's our, that's our jam. So, yeah. We love the Carlisle Club. We love Doc Scantlin and the Imperial Palms Orchestra. And I so wish we could spend another New Year's with them. But if you're in the D.C. area and you have the opportunity, highly recommend it. They're like Rainbow Room. They used to play the Rainbow Room for New Year's Eve. That's how awesome they are. And I know you know what that means. You know, you know. Studio 54. Yeah, but the, yeah, the Rainbow Room on New Year's Eve. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I'm so excited about what we're doing together. I don't mean to divert the show again, but I mean, I'm so excited about what's happening. The possibilities. Yeah. You gotta have options. You know what I mean? Like, I love Rand. Can we talk about Rand? Can we, please? We should totally talk about Rand because I think, I think a lot of people are, well, you, you, you start. You start. Oh, but first, I have to answer the question. We always start the show with, what are you drinking? And after I say what I'm drinking, because what I'm drinking is important. I have a Best Mom Ever wine glass because, yeah, because that's, that's how I roll. And I am drinking a Carlo Rossi Burgundy because that's what Jeffrey Tucker recommended. And I've become addicted to it now. So Carlo Rossi Burgundy and a Best Mom Ever wine glass that I bought. I bought for myself. Okay. Rand, let's talk about Rand. Oh, honey, I'm so worried for him. I just like, you know, my, my own party gives me hell because I, I say nice things about him. But I mean, like, you know, Mike Lee, I love Mike Lee, but he's got, he's got a lot of bad stuff about him. You know, Ted Cruz. Mike, Mike Lee is on my shit list because he co-sponsored the, um, the gambling. Yeah. You know why too? They're all sellouts. Because he's in, he's in Sheldon Adelson's pocket. I know, but Rand is like the least cellist outesty. What? He's like the least cellist outesty. That's my new favorite word. Cellist outesty. Marco Rubio called him out on the debate the other night about, um, his, his immigration bill as affecting people who are, have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. And I just, here's the thing. If, if you're going to lose, fight, fight for the, for the, for the purity, for fight for the end. I'm not a purist. I'm not a purist. But when my, when my, when I know I might lose, if you follow Sun Tzu's teachings and you go crazy bastard strategy, you know, like you're willing to nuclear destroy, you know, mutually assured destruction, then, you know, all of a sudden you're in Trump territory in terms of polls. But I mean, that's just tactics. You know, I think Rand does believe, I honestly think Rand does believe a lot of, probably most of everything that his father believes in many ways. Rand was always there with Murray, you know, and, and our guys, you know, I'm more of a Robert Nozick guy, but we're a big movement. And, you know, Ron and Rand play their part in this. Not, they're not the end all be all. Now let's talk about this, the cult of Paul. Let's talk about the cult of Paul, Rachel, because you're, you're a Paulista. You're a Paulistinian. You know, look for the man. I never could. I'm Pollyanna. I'm independent. I've never taken a dime of money from Rand or Ron. And I probably put in, you know, $150,000 at least worth of work. I've taken, I've taken a lot of money from them, but it's all been taxpayer money. So that should endear me to all the libertarians. So now you're giving it back to them. Yeah. The cult of Paul, and we need to discuss this because like, you always say, why is our time so uncomfortable? It's the uncomfortable stuff that gets the dialogue going so we can move forward our principles, not the stuff that we all agree on. But the stuff we disagree on that makes this important, because I think we've gotten so much into a cult of personality that like, we can't get out of this mindset that maybe a libertarian candidate isn't like a sweet old man, you know, like gentle, pacifistic sort of an old man. This is a strain of libertarian-esque, this paleo-libertarianism and what Rothbard and Lou Rockwell and these men created in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. So, but it's exclusionary to the young secular humanist, the skeptical libertarian, the Penn Jillette libertarian, Penn and Teller libertarian, like myself, for example, the scientific secular humanist libertarian that agrees with Ron Paul on almost everything, but perhaps religion and some other things like immigration. But the Kochs, the Kochs are big free market libertarians. Yeah. So the cult of personality, I think, limits us. And I want to, you know, do you agree? Do you think there's, do you think that there is a cult of personality that limits? Yeah. Yeah, I absolutely do agree. And actually what I think is, is that Ron Paul never wanted a cult of personality. Here, Jesus. He never wanted it. No, he didn't like it. And I could see him getting uncomfortable with the popularity in certain ways. Yeah. I mean, it's the most awkward thing in the world. It was the most awkward thing in the world for me to watch these young kids come up and give him a hug. I understand like where it came from, but like that just wasn't his personality to want to be all touchy feely. I think he, he only gave me one hug in my life and that was a hug goodbye. My last day out of the office. I'm going to cry. No, I'm not going to cry. But he's just not a touchy feely kind of guy. And he's not, he's not into that. That's why this article, this weird article that came out this week. I don't know if you saw that, that there was some kind of friction and jealousy between Randall and Paul. And, and Ron, it just, it, it, it. You're trying to divide us. I see them out there. It totally did not ring true to me because there was. Was that the buzz? Was that the, the, the blaze, the blaze guy from Buzzfeed? Yeah. Yeah. And, and I heard talking about this. So it's, it's out there. People are talking about this rumor and like, oh, it has inside information legs to it. And it's like, it doesn't ring true to me because there is no ego to Ron Paul. There really isn't. And I, I don't, I don't think people are, people really understand that, but like, there's no ego. It's not even possible that that. None of it made any sense to me. I've stepped down from the libertarian Republic. My, as like editor to try and like have a magazine that's, that's objective, at least as objective as it can be with the fact that I own it. Cause I try, you know, I believe in integrity. And, and we, you know, my writers love Randall. They love Randall. They love Ron. And of course they love me. And so that, but like, I've told them, I've said, you don't cover me or my campaign until I'm the news, you know, and until it's, until the, until it's important part of our libertarian story. Otherwise, you know, they're writing about Rand and like, you know, there's an internal struggle going on in between them, between like, you know, the skepticism that the chances that he might win and like what they are, but, but there's not a doubt that, that, that our liberal, that our movement has cohesiveness and, and that, that there are powers working against us to divide us. And like, you know, I try and be a good shepherd for them in order to sort of guide them. We really do need to be a big tent. That's, that's, that's important because divided, we accomplish nothing. Yeah. But I mean, there, there are many fronts to the war and everybody just pick a front and fight on that front and don't fight about whose front is better. Just keep fighting. Just do what you do and, and support each other. And, you know, if we could just do that and it sounds so simple, but, but every organization, the best class I ever took in college was organizational behavior. And it's all about psychology and groups and how, how people fight in fighting and power struggles. And so fascinating. But yeah, every organization has these kinds of struggles.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 2.86, "text": " Yeah, I mean, that's good stuff.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [865, 11, 286, 914,
