{"text": " Um, but yeah, so that happens. McConaughey jumps on top of her. She's all like dazed and she has this immortal line where she's like, you saved my shoe. And it's like, even as a 12 year old, I was like, I don't, I don't care. A little baby feminist. I was like, I'm not, I'm not into it. Um, so yeah, like the most, and you're right. Like he, he's on top of her for several minutes. I think he's a doctor. He's like trying to check if her eyes are dilated. He's just staring at her. Like he doesn't, he doesn't try and do anything to help her. Like it's literally just that he's like staring at her and talking super breathy. Like are you okay? It's a really unnecessary meet cute. No, of course it is. And then on top of that, again, going back to the fact that like they don't have a ton of chemistry and the characters are written really over the top is that Matthew McConaughey ends up trying way too hard to seem into her and being tranced by her in a way that just doesn't feel like appropriate. It just doesn't feel accurate. It ends up feeling like really forced and really belated. It's very forced. And absolutely the whole movie is very, very, very forced. And then she goes, she ends up waking up in the children's wig of the hotline to the hospital. Yeah, you're going to take her to an abnormal window to the hospital. None of it really makes any sense. Yes. And the other thing too about that whole sequence where like they, they do that and then they go on a date and then after that she finds out that he's engaged to her client. Right. Like for starters, it's like, okay, so shouldn't that preclude any other interest in this douchebag that like he was like trying to mack on you while he's engaged? But besides that, it also feels like that's, that again, that feels like an overly convoluted way to get to that point of her being interested in the guy who turns out to be her client. It's like, you didn't need all of that one insane buildup. I would rather have a more traditional Ron Connery where she's infatuated with him based on nothing. I do think it overly complicates a lot of it. So yeah, there's that element. And again, I could rationalize this as being like, oh, well, she's a character who's supposed to have like a practical view of love contrasted with his like more movie love that she has with this guy. So of course they would meet with who's like him saving her as like a damsel in distress. Fine. Although the movie again doesn't play with that as much. As much as it could in ways that are interesting. But even beyond that, it like over complicates elements of the setup. So Fran calls her fiance Eddie because his name is, his last name is like Edward Edison. Yeah. And Eddie's his nickname from college. And so she knows Steve as Steve. And she's like, why, why are you going by a different name? And he explains that Steve is my first name. She just calls me Eddie. But like, why was that? That's only there. So she could be like, oh, I didn't realize. But like, you would think it would be the same guy. If they had the same generic male. Oh, you meet a Steve and you're like, hey, the groom in my wedding is a Steve. No one would ever have that thought. So why dedicate time to that? The only reason I can think of for that is that later on, he's like, Fran, you keep calling me Eddie and I don't even want to be called that anymore. Which is like, Jesus Christ, you're an adult man. You couldn't have also like just told her that at some point in your relationship? Yeah. How long do you have to go like going by the wrong? Jesus. So I mean, there's that. I mean, and there's also just the aspect of it. Two, like to go back to what you were saying that like, she's supposed to have this more pragmatic, detached view of love. But in that case, then why is she more interested in like the guy she can't have who's in like, you know, who has like this really goofy over the top context to him as opposed to the guy who's just there and into her and is available. Well, she doesn't like Massimo because they knew each other when they were little and he was like gross. He ate mud and asked her about her vagina. To me, I think what it comes, yeah, right. But to me, I think what it comes down to is that like, as much as like the story is structured to be about how like this person has this very detached, like practical view of love actually needs to like be more romantic. Is that I don't even think the movie is commits to which version of love she wants. That's why like, it's really hard for me to say like what, and again, like I can kind of see like an idea where like, she's just, you know, a normal woman who, since she's a wedding planner, sees like, you know, the realities of marriage, let's say, but can also sort of understand the, the fantasy. You know what I mean? She's caught in between those two. I mean, but it just, the movie doesn't work hard enough to make that feel like a romance. To me, it's more of a, they have a sequence early on at her job where like, she wins a bet on like, how long one of her marriages, one of the marriages would have lasted. 14 months because they used Olivia Newton-John's I Honestly Love You as their wedding song. So it's like, yeah, so it's weird shit like that, which apparently allows her to predict it down to the fucking week or something, which is nonsense. But like, it's just, it's just one of those things where it's like, so, so I guess like, they're sort of like reaching towards this idea that she has become kind of detached and jaded about relationships. And then when you add that to her back, because of her job and also because of her backstory with her, with her fiance, and yeah, her ex-fiance. But like, but she gets the male, she gets the male rom-com backstory. But the thing with that is that it's like, but you could have that and then have that be as like, this is a defense mechanism against my own actual romantic feelings. But the movie doesn't seem to fully get into that. It's not, it's not really, it's not really exploring her as a character as much as it could. Yeah. Like a cold-hearted phony who like is propping up other people's romances without engaging her own. And someone who's like super romantic and trying really hard to like find the one. Right. It's like, it doesn't make up its mind or it doesn't like provide enough nuance to that. And there are things again that I feel like if they were just played up a little more. So like the, the, the first time we see her as an adult planning a wedding, she's like talking this bride down who's like really stressed out. And she gives her the speech about how like, this is why it's going to go well because your fiance loves you. Just earlier today, he told me, I can't believe she picked me. I can't believe I'm going to marry the most beautiful woman in the world or the most amazing woman or whatever. And that's why I know this marriage isn't just going to work. It's going to last forever is her speech. Which, and again, that fucking, that fucking catchphrase that it's not going to work, it's going to last, it's not just going to work, it's going to last forever. As if there are marriages that work, but don't last until death. Like, what are you talking about? It doesn't make much sense. Like no one has, no one has a working relationship, like marriage that ends after 20 years. It's like the Lucy Kay thing. It's like divorce is always good news. Yeah. Um, but my point was that later on in the movie, and they don't make a show of it. They kind of trust you to recognize that it's happening. When Fran is starting to have second thoughts, she gives her the exact same thing. The exact same speech. Yeah. Um, so it's just like her thing to talk down nervous brides. Um, but I feel like it could have played up that like, so she does have this like cynical view of love. And at this point in the movie, she's talking, she's using it to get a client of hers to marry a woman, a man that she has feelings for. Right. Like that could be more interesting than it is. It's meant to be interesting, but it's just, but they don't play with her being caught between those two modes enough, in my opinion. It's there, but there's not a lot of connective tissue. And I'm not saying like it needs to not be subtle about it, but it needs to just, it needs to feel like the movie at least understands that that's what the character arc is probably supposed to be. Right. Where like, there's a 50, 50% chance that I'm just, you know, assuming that's what it is. And that's not what the movie was about. Right. And that shouldn't be the case. Or the alternative is if you're going to have like these two dueling love stories for no earthly reason, you can give it a reason by making it a case where she becomes infatuated with the groom in this, in this, in this marriage that she's organizing. And then through that infatuation, realize that like she, that, you know, it has her, it has her heart reopened to the idea of romance. And then that leads her to be with Masa. That could be an interesting movie. Absolutely. Where it's less about trying to steal someone's husband or fiance. But I think the way you're discussing it now makes me realize what it's probably makes this movie feel so bland and so weak. And it's that Mary is not infatuated with Steve. She, she, he's the pursuer more than she is, frankly. Yeah. They go out of their way to structure the ending. So he's the one rushing the city hall. Oh yeah. They definitely go out of their way. We'll talk about it. But, but she's, the second she finds out that he's, that he's the groom, she's mad, but there's no point where she's trying to find out more about him. We're like, where she is really expressing any romantic interest. So like what an unbelievably weak character choice when you think about it, that she's just letting these things happen to her, our main character. Yeah. She doesn't really make a lot of active choices. That's how I'm like, I'm not going to marry you. I'm not going to be into you. Okay. Maybe I'll marry you. That's really all of her choices. Um, and that's what's frustrating where like if the movie was a little bit bolder, about making her, you know, maybe she gets drunk one night and like calls him or something and like making it feel like she really does care about him outside of us just assuming that she does. Cause that's what the movie is predicated on. Like she doesn't actually show as a character that she's really romantically interested in Steve outside of her saying like, I agree with you about, you know, wanting a small wedding. That's what I would want to, which is like kind of, it's women who want big weddings are like never portrayed positively romantic comedy. So it's kind of like whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Of course that's what they would bond about. Whatevs. You know what I mean? They don't, once she finds out that he's the groom, she says like, Oh, I have to quit this account because I fell for the groom, which apparently Judy Greer, cause of course she's the best friend in this. Um, fun fact, we were going to cover 27 dresses for the podcast. Um, then we found out that it wasn't on HBO now anymore. Um, but we still got Judy Greer as the best friend in a wedding related romantic comedy, even though she's in that one too. Um, but Judy Greer is the best friend. And, um, it's like, Oh my God, you broke the cardinal rule of wedding planning. You fell in love with the groom. It's like that needs to be a rule. That has to happen. That must be happening all the time. That's the cardinal rule? People get driven out of the industry. Jesus Christ. For having like superficial attraction to men that they can't have in a wedding anyway. It's weird. It's weird. Like the whole way they pretend, again, like this is another movie like Bride Wars where they, they seem to take like the concept of the wedding industrial complex to like unbelievable levels where like there's like a firm for like wedding planning. I don't think it's that weird that she becomes a partner. What I do think is weird about the partnership conversation is she like comes into her boss's office. Um, and she's like, you know, you know, you need me. I make more, um, more in commissions than everyone else in the firm times five combined times five. And, and so she's giving her a pitch about like, I'm going to land this huge account from this like nouveau riche family who's looking to show off. And then when I do, you're going to make me partner. And her boss is like, no, I don't want to do that. She's kind of waffling. And she's like, this is why you're going to do it. Cause you know, you need me. I make more money than everybody else here. I guess I'll have to go create my own firm. Well, or, or like, why is, why is she being, so that's the thing that like makes her boss be like, oh, fine. You're right. But why couldn't you just say, make me a partner. I make more money than everyone combined here. I could sleep. Like, why is the threat? Give me this test so I can get an account to be partner instead of like, I should be a partner. Like she clearly can use that to convince her boss to do something she doesn't want to do. Why doesn't just convince her to make her partner instead of like, I want to convince you to give me one final test. It's weird. Yeah. She should just open her own business, but that's, that's a less weird thing for me to look over than like, but why are they, why is she structuring it like this? You could just ask to become a partner right now. Yeah. Cause clearly she can use all this as love. Like, I don't know. I like, I've thought about this for like 20 minutes today. Like, I don't understand whether you've heard it like this. Like that. It's again, like, like a lot of, a lot of things in this movie, it's an overly convoluted way to get to what they're trying to get to. And much like my frustration with a lot of bride wars, like you could have just written that another way. You could have just written her boss. Her boss is saying like, I read about this family in the newspaper. You're going to get this account and then I'm going to make you a partner. And by the way, do it the other way. This is a, this is another movie where there is randomly just an insanely short timeframe for no reason. Yeah. Guys, this movie also plans this wedding in three months. Um, which like I almost jumped off the couch when she said that just cause like I forgot and I made such a big deal about bride wars in the three months. And this was three months in, in, um, in the wedding planner, not three and a half, like in bride wars. That being said, there's two weeks. Yes. That being said, Mary does say when she's talking to her boss, she wants to get it all undone in three months. I know it's a really tight timeline, but I think I could do it. At least acknowledge it. It's like, but even so it just feels like, I just care about the acknowledgement. Yeah. I agree. Why? It feels like this old school notion of like, we have to have a chicken clock. And they don't realize that weddings automatically have momentum because they're counting down towards a date. It doesn't have to be a shortened amount of time. Yeah. And, and especially in a movie like this where, where she's has a budding love of the groom, a longer period of time would allow that love to grow more. Um, so yeah, it's, it's, it's so unnecessary and so fucking frustrating. Um, yeah. So God bless the romantic comedies we've seen thus far that have weddings that don't force a timeline on it. Like my big, big, big wedding or sweet home Alabama too didn't have a set timeline. Not that I recall. I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Wedding Crashers doesn't either. Like there's a point later on where they just kind of go through a montage and it's like the indications that time has passed and they don't say how long. Yeah. I mean, that's fair. That's totally fair. And they have plenty of montages in this movie too, as they had in Bride Wars. So I feel like if your movie relies heavily on montages, like it's even worse than you think you need to rely on a timeline. Yeah. But what else? Um, yes, there are a lot of comparison points to this in Bride Wars. Um, the other one is that this is another wedding focused romantic comedy that starts with a main character as a little girl. And that is, I think that is, it's a trope for, for chick flicks in general. I think like Miss Congeniality, for example, isn't a wedding focused movie and it starts with her as a girl. But with wedding movies in particular, I feel like I can name more examples of movies where that, where it does start with a girl that went out. 27 Dresses also does it that way. Sweet Home Alabama also does it that way. Um, and it's kind of weird. I have a lot of feelings about like, don't, like I get it, you know, stay very typically girls dream about their big day, but like it starts to get icky. This like focus on like women about to get married. It feels like you're trying to drive it home to kids though. Like you should, you should care about this. Yeah. And it just feels like, like a disregard that women when they hopefully should be married as adult women. You know what I mean? Yeah. I think it disregards the concept of an adult woman, if that makes any sense. It's a, it's symbolically and fanalizes on a certain level. The interesting thing about the opening to the wedding planner though, is she's not necessarily dreaming. She's a little girl playing with like a bride and groom Barbie. But she's not dreaming of being a bride. She's not dreaming of her wedding. She's talking to the bride and then it cuts to her talking to the bride as an adult. So even as a child, she's like helping to coordinate the wedding. Yeah. Um, which is clever. You know, she's not dreaming of her own day. But again, like everything makes me question like, well, what, well, what is the arc here? Yeah. Because it doesn't seem like she's ever romanticized marriage, even as a child. So why would she need to learn to not romanticize it, to marry Massimo and then only to learn to, to, to, to give it to the romance, to marry Steve? Like it doesn't make any sense. And let's get into the ending also. Because like, as you, as you said, and like reading the synopsis before, it sounds like you skipped something, but you didn't. I did not skip a goddamn thing. Because in the end, they're about to get, you know, she and Massimo are about to get married. And her father suddenly has like this moment of conscience where he objects and says, no, like, you're right. You shouldn't have to do this. And her other old friends are like, oh, good. I was going to object to you. Yeah. And basically tell her like, you know, you shouldn't be forcing yourself to be with somebody you don't want to. You should have what you want. want. And she says, that thing does touch me. No, I mean, it is a nice scene. And there are some nice scenes with her and her father. And you're not happy. Yeah. And he tells her like, and she's like, no, it's okay. Like, I think I'm being an adult. I'm doing the right thing. Yeah, she's like, Massimo's a good man and he'll, he'll take care of me. I just, I'm, I'm all grown up now. And she's like, she's teary eyed. She always plays it well. The next part cuts to Steve pulling up in a cab outside of City Hall. And as he gets out of the cab, Massimo and her father and her father's friends are all standing on the sidewalk and reveal to Steve, oh, they didn't go through with the wedding. Yeah. We don't see that happen. We don't see her make the decision to leave. I think the way Massimo explains, Massimo says she didn't want to marry me. She wanted to marry you, Steve, which sounds like then Mary was the one who was like, no, no, I'm not going to do that. But then he said, I couldn't go through with it. If she, I couldn't allow myself to marry somebody she doesn't love. Which to me is like, that should have been. Which makes me wonder if Massimo did it. But either way, why didn't we see that? Or, more to the point. Why did it structure that way? And more to the point, why can't it just be like that he bursts in in the middle of the day and there's a damn ceremony. It feels like they go, again, this is another thing, where it feels like they go out of their way because they had that image of, oh, we want them to kiss and then pan up to the old movie on the screen to do the happily ever after. They had that idea. I'm fine with that, but I don't understand why. It's a really emotional scene where she says to her dad, no, you know what? I'm going to be a grown up. I'm going to marry this guy who I'm not in love with because it's the practical thing to do. And then, you know, in the timeline the movie is presenting, then she walks down the aisle and like two seconds later, one of them decides, I'm not doing this anymore. But they don't see that. Yeah, but like, you don't see that, but I understand why they would structure it that way. Why she wouldn't just have that scene with her dad and have him be like, you're right, dad. And that would still be a very emotional beat. Like, I don't get it. Yeah, it's such a weird. I don't get why they structure it that way. The only thing I can think of is like, they did write a scene where she does it, but the movie maybe like went way over schedule and Jennifer Lopez had to make something else and they would have had to pay her a ton of money and they're like, no, we can write around this. We can write around what is in any other universe. The climax. The movie. We don't see the climax of this movie. I mean, I guess the climax is her and Steve getting together. That's the last scene. But like, if we consider Mary, if we consider the Mary the main character, which she is, we don't get to see the main character decide, I don't want to marry this guy. I want to hold on, hold on the idea of a marriage that is built on romance, which is, we're assuming, her main arc. Right. Why don't we see that scene? It's the most, even, even, as much as I used to like this movie as a kid, I was like, what? Why didn't we see that? It's baffling. It's more baffling than I think any choice in Bride Wars, honestly. Because it's huge. It's a, if you're going to cut any random scene from a movie, the worst scene to cut is the fucking climax. That's Screenwriting 101. They made sure to do a ticking clock and all that shit, but they didn't make sure to do a climax. Yeah, it's, it's one of those things where like, it doesn't add anything to do it that way other than like, as a vague half-assed misdirect that like, that doesn't really matter. It's a cheap misdirect, that's absolutely what it is. It doesn't really matter because all it does is take all the emotional impact out of the finale. Like, it would have been more impactful if Steve had burst into the courtroom as she was about to say, I do, and have her go, oh, thank God. Yeah. You know, or something. And try and establish that the only reason why she was making that pragmatic choice is because she thought he was gone, but now that he's not gone, she wants to be with him. Like, they could have driven that point home in a more direct, you know, way. And they could have just, they could have just made a too-mean-so-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much more obviously different choices outside of the fact that one is married. And one is cartoonishly Italian. Yes. They could have made it so Steve actually is like a risky guy to be with, you know what I mean? That Massimo is in his own way the practical choice, and Steve is somebody who, you know, she doesn't necessarily know that she can count on all the time and stuff like that. But, like, Steve is just like a stand-up pediatrician, you know what I mean? So, like, there's no reason for her not to choose him. And Massimo's a goofball with no job and a Vespa. He's very sweet character, though, he is. But it's, they don't, yeah, I mean, again, I enjoy watching this movie, but I won't defend its choices in a court of law. Like, it's insane. It's insane to do that more than any other thing we'll criticize in the podcast. Like, not having, first of all, not having that scene. And structuring it in a way that makes it obvious that they didn't have that scene, you know what I mean? Because, again, they could have just re-structured, re-wrote the scene with her dad. Yeah. Like, it's bizarre. It's crazy. It's a really key moment. It is so crazy. And we got, instead, just Steve and Fran having, like, a calm conversation about not wanting to be with each other anymore. Like, if you're worried about, like, preserving and not making the ending, like, anticlimactic and making it suspenseful and that's why you didn't include the climactic scene, which doesn't, logic just beggars the mind, then if you're gonna do that, then at least make the scene between Steve and Fran interesting. Yeah. Because that's what we're getting instead. Like, it was way too, it was way too relaxed and reasonable, which, to be fair. Which is why he doesn't want to marry her anymore. Yeah. Not really. Yeah. So, I mean, the whole ending just kind of falls flat because it just doesn't structure itself right. No, it doesn't.

happens. McConaughey jumps on top of her. She's all like dazed and she has this immortal line where she's like, you saved my shoe. And it's like, even as a 12 year old, I was like, I don't, I don't care. A little baby feminist. I was like, I'm not, I'm not into it. Um, so yeah, like the most, and you're right. Like he, he's on top of her for several minutes. I think he's a doctor. He's like trying to check if her eyes are dilated. He's just staring at her. Like he doesn't, he doesn't try and do anything to help her. Like it's literally just that he's like staring at her and talking super breathy. Like are you okay? It's a really unnecessary meet cute. No, of course it is. And then on top of that, again, going back to the fact that like they don't have a ton of chemistry and the characters are written really over the top is that Matthew McConaughey ends up trying way too hard to seem into her and being tranced by her in a way that just doesn't feel like appropriate. It just doesn't feel accurate. It ends up feeling like really forced and really belated. It's very forced. And absolutely the whole movie is very, very, very forced. And then she goes, she ends up waking up in the children's wig of the hotline to the hospital. Yeah, you're going to take her to an abnormal window to the hospital. None of it really makes any sense. Yes. And the other thing too about that whole sequence where like they, they do that and then they go on a date and then after that she finds out that he's engaged to her client. Right. Like for starters, it's like, okay, so shouldn't that preclude any other interest in this douchebag that like he was like trying to mack on you while he's engaged? But besides that, it also feels like that's, that again, that feels like an overly convoluted way to get to that point of her being interested in the guy who turns out to be her client. It's like, you didn't need all of that one insane buildup. I would rather have a more traditional Ron Connery where she's infatuated with him based on nothing. I do think it overly complicates a lot of it. So yeah, there's that element. And again, I could rationalize this as being like, oh, well, she's a character who's supposed to have like a practical view of love contrasted with his like more movie love that she has with this guy. So of course they would meet with who's like him saving her as like a damsel in distress. Fine. Although the movie again doesn't play with that as much. As much as it could in ways that are interesting. But even beyond that, it like over complicates elements of the setup. So Fran calls her fiance Eddie because his name is, his last name is like Edward Edison. Yeah. And Eddie's his nickname from college. And so she knows Steve as Steve. And she's like, why, why are you going by a different name? And he explains that Steve is my first name. She just calls me Eddie. But like, why was that? That's only there. So she could be like, oh, I didn't realize. But like, you would think it would be the same guy. If they had the same generic male. Oh, you meet a Steve and you're like, hey, the groom in my wedding is a Steve. No one would ever have that thought. So why dedicate time to that? The only reason I can think of for that is that later on, he's like, Fran, you keep calling me Eddie and I don't even want to be called that anymore. Which is like, Jesus Christ, you're an adult man. You couldn't have also like just told her that at some point in your relationship? Yeah. How long do you have to go like going by the wrong? Jesus. So I mean, there's that. I mean, and there's also just the aspect of it. Two, like to go back to what you were saying that like, she's supposed to have this more pragmatic, detached view of love. But in that case, then why is she more interested in like the guy she can't have who's in like, you know, who has like this really goofy over the top context to him as opposed to the guy who's just there and into her and is available. Well, she doesn't like Massimo because they knew each other when they were little and he was like gross. He ate mud and asked her about her vagina. To me, I think what it comes, yeah, right. But to me, I think what it comes down to is that like, as much as like the story is structured to be about how like this person has this very detached, like practical view of love actually needs to like be more romantic. Is that I don't even think the movie is commits to which version of love she wants. That's why like, it's really hard for me to say like what, and again, like I can kind of see like an idea where like, she's just, you know, a normal woman who, since she's a wedding planner, sees like, you know, the realities of marriage, let's say, but can also sort of understand the, the fantasy. You know what I mean? She's caught in between those two. I mean, but it just, the movie doesn't work hard enough to make that feel like a romance. To me, it's more of a, they have a sequence early on at her job where like, she wins a bet on like, how long one of her marriages, one of the marriages would have lasted. 14 months because they used Olivia Newton-John's I Honestly Love You as their wedding song. So it's like, yeah, so it's weird shit like that, which apparently allows her to predict it down to the fucking week or something, which is nonsense. But like, it's just, it's just one of those things where it's like, so, so I guess like, they're sort of like reaching towards this idea that she has become kind of detached and jaded about relationships. And then when you add that to her back, because of her job and also because of her backstory with her, with her fiance, and yeah, her ex-fiance. But like, but she gets the male, she gets the male rom-com backstory. But the thing with that is that it's like, but you could have that and then have that be as like, this is a defense mechanism against my own actual romantic feelings. But the movie doesn't seem to fully get into that. It's not, it's not really, it's not really exploring her as a character as much as it could. Yeah. Like a cold-hearted phony who like is propping up other people's romances without engaging her own. And someone who's like super romantic and trying really hard to like find the one. Right. It's like, it doesn't make up its mind or it doesn't like provide enough nuance to that. And there are things again that I feel like if they were just played up a little more. So like the, the, the first time we see her as an adult planning a wedding, she's like talking this bride down who's like really stressed out. And she gives her the speech about how like, this is why it's going to go well because your fiance loves you. Just earlier today, he told me, I can't believe she picked me. I can't believe I'm going to marry the most beautiful woman in the world or the most amazing woman or whatever. And that's why I know this marriage isn't just going to work. It's going to last forever is her speech. Which, and again, that fucking, that fucking catchphrase that it's not going to work, it's going to last, it's not just going to work, it's going to last forever. As if there are marriages that work, but don't last until death. Like, what are you talking about? It doesn't make much sense. Like no one has, no one has a working relationship, like marriage that ends after 20 years. It's like the Lucy Kay thing. It's like divorce is always good news. Yeah. Um, but my point was that later on in the movie, and they don't make a show of it. They kind of trust you to recognize that it's happening. When Fran is starting to have second thoughts, she gives her the exact same thing. The exact same speech. Yeah. Um, so it's just like her thing to talk down nervous brides. Um, but I feel like it could have played up that like, so she does have this like cynical view of love. And at this point in the movie, she's talking, she's using it to get a client of hers to marry a woman, a man that she has feelings for. Right. Like that could be more interesting than it is. It's meant to be interesting, but it's just, but they don't play with her being caught between those two modes enough, in my opinion. It's there, but there's not a lot of connective tissue. And I'm not saying like it needs to not be subtle about it, but it needs to just, it needs to feel like the movie at least understands that that's what the character arc is probably supposed to be. Right. Where like, there's a 50, 50% chance that I'm just, you know, assuming that's what it is. And that's not what the movie was about. Right. And that shouldn't be the case. Or the alternative is if you're going to have like these two dueling love stories for no earthly reason, you can give it a reason by making it a case where she becomes infatuated with the groom in this, in this, in this marriage that she's organizing. And then through that infatuation, realize that like she, that, you know, it has her, it has her heart reopened to the idea of romance. And then that leads her to be with Masa. That could be an interesting movie. Absolutely. Where it's less about trying to steal someone's husband or fiance. But I think the way you're discussing it now makes me realize what it's probably makes this movie feel so bland and so weak. And it's that Mary is not infatuated with Steve. She, she, he's the pursuer more than she is, frankly. Yeah. They go out of their way to structure the ending. So he's the one rushing the city hall. Oh yeah. They definitely go out of their way. We'll talk about it. But, but she's, the second she finds out that he's, that he's the groom, she's mad, but there's no point where she's trying to find out more about him. We're like, where she is really expressing any romantic interest. So like what an unbelievably weak character choice when you think about it, that she's just letting these things happen to her, our main character. Yeah. She doesn't really make a lot of active choices. That's how I'm like, I'm not going to marry you. I'm not going to be into you. Okay. Maybe I'll marry you. That's really all of her choices. Um, and that's what's frustrating where like if the movie was a little bit bolder, about making her, you know, maybe she gets drunk one night and like calls him or something and like making it feel like she really does care about him outside of us just assuming that she does. Cause that's what the movie is predicated on. Like she doesn't actually show as a character that she's really romantically interested in Steve outside of her saying like, I agree with you about, you know, wanting a small wedding. That's what I would want to, which is like kind of, it's women who want big weddings are like never portrayed positively romantic comedy. So it's kind of like whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Of course that's what they would bond about. Whatevs. You know what I mean? They don't, once she finds out that he's the groom, she says like, Oh, I have to quit this account because I fell for the groom, which apparently Judy Greer, cause of course she's the best friend in this. Um, fun fact, we were going to cover 27 dresses for the podcast. Um, then we found out that it wasn't on HBO now anymore. Um, but we still got Judy Greer as the best friend in a wedding related romantic comedy, even though she's in that one too. Um, but Judy Greer is the best friend. And, um, it's like, Oh my God, you broke the cardinal rule of wedding planning. You fell in love with the groom. It's like that needs to be a rule. That has to happen. That must be happening all the time. That's the cardinal rule? People get driven out of the industry. Jesus Christ. For having like superficial attraction to men that they can't have in a wedding anyway. It's weird. It's weird. Like the whole way they pretend, again, like this is another movie like Bride Wars where they, they seem to take like the concept of the wedding industrial complex to like unbelievable levels where like there's like a firm for like wedding planning. I don't think it's that weird that she becomes a partner. What I do think is weird about the partnership conversation is she like comes into her boss's office. Um, and she's like, you know, you know, you need me. I make more, um, more in commissions than everyone else in the firm times five combined times five. And, and so she's giving her a pitch about like, I'm going to land this huge account from this like nouveau riche family who's looking to show off. And then when I do, you're going to make me partner. And her boss is like, no, I don't want to do that. She's kind of waffling. And she's like, this is why you're going to do it. Cause you know, you need me. I make more money than everybody else here. I guess I'll have to go create my own firm. Well, or, or like, why is, why is she being, so that's the thing that like makes her boss be like, oh, fine. You're right. But why couldn't you just say, make me a partner. I make more money than everyone combined here. I could sleep. Like, why is the threat? Give me this test so I can get an account to be partner instead of like, I should be a partner. Like she clearly can use that to convince her boss to do something she doesn't want to do. Why doesn't just convince her to make her partner instead of like, I want to convince you to give me one final test. It's weird. Yeah. She should just open her own business, but that's, that's a less weird thing for me to look over than like, but why are they, why is she structuring it like this? You could just ask to become a partner right now. Yeah. Cause clearly she can use all this as love. Like, I don't know. I like, I've thought about this for like 20 minutes today. Like, I don't understand whether you've heard it like this. Like that. It's again, like, like a lot of, a lot of things in this movie, it's an overly convoluted way to get to what they're trying to get to. And much like my frustration with a lot of bride wars, like you could have just written that another way. You could have just written her boss. Her boss is saying like, I read about this family in the newspaper. You're going to get this account and then I'm going to make you a partner. And by the way, do it the other way. This is a, this is another movie where there is randomly just an insanely short timeframe for no reason. Yeah. Guys, this movie also plans this wedding in three months. Um, which like I almost jumped off the couch when she said that just cause like I forgot and I made such a big deal about bride wars in the three months. And this was three months in, in, um, in the wedding planner, not three and a half, like in bride wars. That being said, there's two weeks. Yes. That being said, Mary does say when she's talking to her boss, she wants to get it all undone in three months. I know it's a really tight timeline, but I think I could do it. At least acknowledge it. It's like, but even so it just feels like, I just care about the acknowledgement. Yeah. I agree. Why? It feels like this old school notion of like, we have to have a chicken clock. And they don't realize that weddings automatically have momentum because they're counting down towards a date. It doesn't have to be a shortened amount of time. Yeah. And, and especially in a movie like this where, where she's has a budding love of the groom, a longer period of time would allow that love to grow more. Um, so yeah, it's, it's, it's so unnecessary and so fucking frustrating. Um, yeah. So God bless the romantic comedies we've seen thus far that have weddings that don't force a timeline on it. Like my big, big, big wedding or sweet home Alabama too didn't have a set timeline. Not that I recall. I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Wedding Crashers doesn't either. Like there's a point later on where they just kind of go through a montage and it's like the indications that time has passed and they don't say how long. Yeah. I mean, that's fair. That's totally fair. And they have plenty of montages in this movie too, as they had in Bride Wars. So I feel like if your movie relies heavily on montages, like it's even worse than you think you need to rely on a timeline. Yeah. But what else? Um, yes, there are a lot of comparison points to this in Bride Wars. Um, the other one is that this is another wedding focused romantic comedy that starts with a main character as a little girl. And that is, I think that is, it's a trope for, for chick flicks in general. I think like Miss Congeniality, for example, isn't a wedding focused movie and it starts with her as a girl. But with wedding movies in particular, I feel like I can name more examples of movies where that, where it does start with a girl that went out. 27 Dresses also does it that way. Sweet Home Alabama also does it that way. Um, and it's kind of weird. I have a lot of feelings about like, don't, like I get it, you know, stay very typically girls dream about their big day, but like it starts to get icky. This like focus on like women about to get married. It feels like you're trying to drive it home to kids though. Like you should, you should care about this. Yeah. And it just feels like, like a disregard that women when they hopefully should be married as adult women. You know what I mean? Yeah. I think it disregards the concept of an adult woman, if that makes any sense. It's a, it's symbolically and fanalizes on a certain level. The interesting thing about the opening to the wedding planner though, is she's not necessarily dreaming. She's a little girl playing with like a bride and groom Barbie. But she's not dreaming of being a bride. She's not dreaming of her wedding. She's talking to the bride and then it cuts to her talking to the bride as an adult. So even as a child, she's like helping to coordinate the wedding. Yeah. Um, which is clever. You know, she's not dreaming of her own day. But again, like everything makes me question like, well, what, well, what is the arc here? Yeah. Because it doesn't seem like she's ever romanticized marriage, even as a child. So why would she need to learn to not romanticize it, to marry Massimo and then only to learn to, to, to, to give it to the romance, to marry Steve? Like it doesn't make any sense. And let's get into the ending also. Because like, as you, as you said, and like reading the synopsis before, it sounds like you skipped something, but you didn't. I did not skip a goddamn thing. Because in the end, they're about to get, you know, she and Massimo are about to get married. And her father suddenly has like this moment of conscience where he objects and says, no, like, you're right. You shouldn't have to do this. And her other old friends are like, oh, good. I was going to object to you. Yeah. And basically tell her like, you know, you shouldn't be forcing yourself to be with somebody you don't want to. You should have what you want. want. And she says, that thing does touch me. No, I mean, it is a nice scene. And there are some nice scenes with her and her father. And you're not happy. Yeah. And he tells her like, and she's like, no, it's okay. Like, I think I'm being an adult. I'm doing the right thing. Yeah, she's like, Massimo's a good man and he'll, he'll take care of me. I just, I'm, I'm all grown up now. And she's like, she's teary eyed. She always plays it well. The next part cuts to Steve pulling up in a cab outside of City Hall. And as he gets out of the cab, Massimo and her father and her father's friends are all standing on the sidewalk and reveal to Steve, oh, they didn't go through with the wedding. Yeah. We don't see that happen. We don't see her make the decision to leave. I think the way Massimo explains, Massimo says she didn't want to marry me. She wanted to marry you, Steve, which sounds like then Mary was the one who was like, no, no, I'm not going to do that. But then he said, I couldn't go through with it. If she, I couldn't allow myself to marry somebody she doesn't love. Which to me is like, that should have been. Which makes me wonder if Massimo did it. But either way, why didn't we see that? Or, more to the point. Why did it structure that way? And more to the point, why can't it just be like that he bursts in in the middle of the day and there's a damn ceremony. It feels like they go, again, this is another thing, where it feels like they go out of their way because they had that image of, oh, we want them to kiss and then pan up to the old movie on the screen to do the happily ever after. They had that idea. I'm fine with that, but I don't understand why. It's a really emotional scene where she says to her dad, no, you know what? I'm going to be a grown up. I'm going to marry this guy who I'm not in love with because it's the practical thing to do. And then, you know, in the timeline the movie is presenting, then she walks down the aisle and like two seconds later, one of them decides, I'm not doing this anymore. But they don't see that. Yeah, but like, you don't see that, but I understand why they would structure it that way. Why she wouldn't just have that scene with her dad and have him be like, you're right, dad. And that would still be a very emotional beat. Like, I don't get it. Yeah, it's such a weird. I don't get why they structure it that way. The only thing I can think of is like, they did write a scene where she does it, but the movie maybe like went way over schedule and Jennifer Lopez had to make something else and they would have had to pay her a ton of money and they're like, no, we can write around this. We can write around what is in any other universe. The climax. The movie. We don't see the climax of this movie. I mean, I guess the climax is her and Steve getting together. That's the last scene. But like, if we consider Mary, if we consider the Mary the main character, which she is, we don't get to see the main character decide, I don't want to marry this guy. I want to hold on, hold on the idea of a marriage that is built on romance, which is, we're assuming, her main arc. Right. Why don't we see that scene? It's the most, even, even, as much as I used to like this movie as a kid, I was like, what? Why didn't we see that? It's baffling. It's more baffling than I think any choice in Bride Wars, honestly. Because it's huge. It's a, if you're going to cut any random scene from a movie, the worst scene to cut is the fucking climax. That's Screenwriting 101. They made sure to do a ticking clock and all that shit, but they didn't make sure to do a climax. Yeah, it's, it's one of those things where like, it doesn't add anything to do it that way other than like, as a vague half-assed misdirect that like, that doesn't really matter. It's a cheap misdirect, that's absolutely what it is. It doesn't really matter because all it does is take all the emotional impact out of the finale. Like, it would have been more impactful if Steve had burst into the courtroom as she was about to say, I do, and have her go, oh, thank God. Yeah. You know, or something. And try and establish that the only reason why she was making that pragmatic choice is because she thought he was gone, but now that he's not gone, she wants to be with him. Like, they could have driven that point home in a more direct, you know, way. And they could have just, they could have just made a too-mean-so-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much-a-much more obviously different choices outside of the fact that one is married. And one is cartoonishly Italian. Yes. They could have made it so Steve actually is like a risky guy to be with, you know what I mean? That Massimo is in his own way the practical choice, and Steve is somebody who, you know, she doesn't necessarily know that she can count on all the time and stuff like that. But, like, Steve is just like a stand-up pediatrician, you know what I mean? So, like, there's no reason for her not to choose him. And Massimo's a goofball with no job and a Vespa. He's very sweet character, though, he is. But it's, they don't, yeah, I mean, again, I enjoy watching this movie, but I won't defend its choices in a court of law. Like, it's insane. It's insane to do that more than any other thing we'll criticize in the podcast. Like, not having, first of all, not having that scene. And structuring it in a way that makes it obvious that they didn't have that scene, you know what I mean? Because, again, they could have just re-structured, re-wrote the scene with her dad. Yeah. Like, it's bizarre. It's crazy. It's a really key moment. It is so crazy. And we got, instead, just Steve and Fran having, like, a calm conversation about not wanting to be with each other anymore. Like, if you're worried about, like, preserving and not making the ending, like, anticlimactic and making it suspenseful and that's why you didn't include the climactic scene, which doesn't, logic just beggars the mind, then if you're gonna do that, then at least make the scene between Steve and Fran interesting. Yeah. Because that's what we're getting instead. Like, it was way too, it was way too relaxed and reasonable, which, to be fair. Which is why he doesn't want to marry her anymore. Yeah. Not really. Yeah. So, I mean, the whole ending just kind of falls flat because it just doesn't structure itself right. No, it doesn't.
