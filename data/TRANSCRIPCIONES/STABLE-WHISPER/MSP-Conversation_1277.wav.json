{"text": " I want to go back to the case, Kwesi's case. You know, I remember that moment. I was in grade nine, and now I'm just exposing myself to the world. But I was in grade nine when that case was going on. And I remember thinking to myself that even the way Kwesi's case was portrayed in the media, like, it was not believable, right? And this, for me, is the underlying, the kind of current that underlies most stories about rape and sexual harassment experiences of women in South Africa is that our stories are always open to interrogation. Our stories are always open to being questioned, like, was it really? But did he actually? But how were you dressed? Were you drunk? There's always a second guessing that comes with the experiences of women. So whether it's, you know, the horrible extreme of rape and domestic abuse, or whether it's, you know, the normal walking down the street and being sexually harassed, our experiences are never valuable in and of themselves. Our experiences are never valid in that sense. And I think this is part of the dangerous aspect, you know, of this conversation. I want to just read some SMSs that are coming through to us here. It's quite disturbing SMSs that I want to read. So someone says here, a female staff member asked our CEO for a meeting to voice some concerns that she had. He told her to grow some balls and buy a box of tissues, right? And then the next one, another interesting one, is where does complimenting stop when it comes to harassment? And it's hilarious for me, because these are the kinds of things, it's almost like, you know, women, yeah, okay, I'm not, I will allow you to do the commenting. I'm just the show host. Next, another SMS here. But why call it rape culture is I have a problem with something criminal being upgraded to culture, as generally culture is something we accept. And as a father of a two year old princess, I have a problem with sexual assault being called rape culture instead of rape crimes. And I think this is a big thing, right? It's a language around how we, how we, you know, discuss this topic. And if you don't mind, Fezi, I want us to take a call. And then you can just sort of respond and give us some of your thoughts. And we're going to go over to Ijeoma in Stellenbosch. Ijeoma, it's so good to see you calling in. I feel like all my friends and family are just calling in. It's awesome. We must take the opportunity to do so. This is so exciting. Thanks, Ijeoma. Tell us your thoughts. Yeah, I think most of what I wanted to call in and say has mainly been captured within the past discussion within the past few minutes. But I think what I want to contribute, just from my own personal experiences regarding the discussion is looking specifically, also that the institutional oppression that happens when we discuss rape and you know, how the whole idea of the perpetrator and the victim is played out, and not necessarily taken seriously, and followed through, but also acknowledging the intersectionality where maybe a black woman wants to go and report the rape that happened, but isn't taken as seriously as a white woman. And I think that's something that also needs to be fleshed out and looked at where we see within the broader movement of feminism as well, where we see it almost being captured in a sense by white middle class women taking up the forefront of what a lot of black women have been doing. And just not acknowledging the intersectionality in that. That's one comment I wanted to make. The second one I wanted to talk about was how often there was a specific event that happened in Stellenbosch where the EFF had a march, I think earlier in March. And an incident that happened was one of the women that was protecting the statue, or no, there was a clash basically between AfriForum and other students. And what happened was there were violent, it was a very violent space where members of AfriForum were openly saying things like, oh, don't attack that woman, you know, she's already been raped before, making very sexist and violent comments towards women within these spaces. So I think something that needs to be acknowledged as well that, you know, with this rape culture that we talk about, that there's also a lot of racism that perpetuates these spaces and needs to be looked at. So that's one thing that I wanted to bring across. And I think maybe yesterday, people were following Stellenbosch, University, well, the woman at Stellenbosch University also did a protest, a naked protest in solidarity with the RU reference list. So there is a national call as well, with regards to dealing with this. Definitely. Thanks, Ijeoma. I really appreciate your contributions. And we're gonna head over to some news headlines with Regan Thor. It is 10.30 now. We'll get back and continue the discussion. Thanks. Very good morning to Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba. Has started delivering judgment in the application by the DA to have the decision to withdraw corruption charges against the president set aside. Ledwaba has so far summarized the entire history of the case, going back to the start of the investigation in 2001 and the 2009 decision to scrap the charges. Cabinet's extended Treasury Director General Ongiso Fuzile's contract for another five years. There was speculation late last year that Fuzile was on his way out and made a media report that he was told not to reapply for the position. President Jacob Zuma's reshuffling of finance ministers last December fueled speculation that Fuzile would also be sacked. And the SA National Defense Force says a civilian doctor has been released on bail. He was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two female recruits in Otsuron. The incidents are believed to have occurred at the South African Army Infantry School in Otsuron earlier this month. These stories and much more at 11 rather, or as it happens. EWN Traffic. At the moment there's an accident scene slowing down traffic on the N3 South between London Road and Lynxfield. Traffic on the M2 West is very slow from the Crown Interchange to Main Reef Road. In Little Falls we still have faulty traffic lights at Hendrik Porghieter and Van de Kloof as well as Hendrik Porghieter and Van Staden. We also have faulty traffic lights in Blairgowrie at Conrad and Standard. And in Cape Town roadworks are slowing down traffic on the N1 inbound at Christian Barnard. Karabo Charlie, EWN Traffic.

And I remember this because she's personally one of my friends and she said, I was at the protest and at the statue standing up for my rights. I was threatened with rape and hit by an AfriForum member. The university didn't do anything. That is rape culture. I want to bring in Fezi into the discussion quickly. Fezi, thank you so much for holding all this time. But I mean, you know, Ijeoma raised a very interesting point and that has to do with intersectionality. And how within this struggle, yes, we, you know, we've got all women. But the reality is, of course, that we do have quite a bit of appropriation of the story happening where, you know, the concerns of some groups get to trump the concerns of others. And it's difficult, right? Like it's an ugly discussion to have that, you know, black women can be and queer bodies can be screaming about, you know, rape and rape culture and sexual harassment for days. Then, you know, one person comes up and says, oh, this is what I've been experiencing. And it's a moment. I mean, talk me through this. What are your perspectives on this? You know, I think Ijeoma makes some brilliant points. But I think what she is fantastic in highlighting is A, the institutional component of violence against women and queer bodies. And I think also this conversation about intersectionality. And I think that's currently what we're experiencing at Rhodes ourselves, right? So maybe you want to take us back a little bit in history and think about the Soudin Commission, right? And it was a commission that was set up by the Minister of Higher Education. In the aftermath of the Wrights Fall. And it was an attempt to investigate transformation and institutional culture in higher education institutions, right? And my particular, the reason why I'm interested in this is I'm interested in the submissions that Rhodes made, right? And the Rhodes submission said that the role of sexism and sexual harassment was mostly directly highlighted by the people that were speaking up for Rhodes. And they spoke about the silent and salient features of rape and violence against women as a result of the institutional policies that were captured in Rhodes University management structures and the other various things that make up a university. So already in that moment, I feel like that was an opportunity for the country at large and universities across the board to think seriously about what this thing is, what this violence is, right? And we just don't see that kind of engagement, right? So it's just left in a report. And, you know, it's another thing that gets filed and stored and gets dust on it. But we don't, as universities, come and say, well, actually, what are the policies? What are the structures that need to have patriarchal violence dismantled? But also, yeah, so, and as you say, Joma makes an excellent point about intersectionality, right? I think part of the real horror sometimes of being at Rhodes University is the pervadedness of a system of whiteness, right? And I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about whiteness, right, of a system. And how there's just real erasure of black life, black experiences, black bodies, and how black bodies are often dispensable and are not really taken seriously. And we see that across the country. We see that in our public and political discourse. We see that, for example, in the Oscar Pistorius case and how it became the most important story because that was a conversation about white people. But you also just see that every time you read Sunday Times, there's a very small section about some boy or some girl getting raped in the township. And it kind of normalizes, right? So we see how the media normalizes violence against black bodies. It makes an incredible spectacle when white bodies are on the line. And you see that at Rhodes University as well, right? So we see that there's one particular rape victim story often taken seriously. And I think that's deeply troubling because there are so many students that have come up in these protests. And, you know, for better or for worse, the RE reference list has been out, right? But, you know, you just see throngs of women who have been harassed, who have been violated, who have been brutalized by not only students but academics as well. And also, then you have a management that refuses, to remove and interdict against rape survivors, against people that have spoken up against rape, right? So that's the really deplorable thing about Rhodes University right now is that they are themselves being complicit in a system that wants to violate the bodies of survivors, right? And then there's all this, like, bizarre talk about, hey, no, we're actually doing the right thing. We are following the limits of the Constitution. But, I mean, if a constitution is interested in, in making sure that people don't have dignity, then that's not a constitution that should be taken seriously. You know? And also, I don't want to, I'm not throwing shade at the Constitution. No, I'm with you. It's quite useful. But I think the way in which Rhodes management has interpreted the Constitution is deeply problematic and so telling of the, of just, I'm sorry, the anti-intellectualism that is being fostered in our public spaces but also in our higher education sector and", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 3.1, "text": " I want to go back to the case, Kwesi's case.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [286, 528, 281, 352,

You know, I remember that moment. I was in grade nine, and now I'm just exposing myself to the world. But I was in grade nine when that case was going on. And I remember thinking to myself that even the way Kwesi's case was portrayed in the media, like, it was not believable, right? And this, for me, is the underlying, the kind of current that underlies most stories about rape and sexual harassment experiences of women in South Africa is that our stories are always open to interrogation. Our stories are always open to being questioned, like, was it really? But did he actually? But how were you dressed? Were you drunk? There's always a second guessing that comes with the experiences of women. So whether it's, you know, the horrible extreme of rape and domestic abuse, or whether it's, you know, the normal walking down the street and being sexually harassed, our experiences are never valuable in and of themselves. Our experiences are never valid in that sense. And I think this is part of the dangerous aspect, you know, of this conversation. I want to just read some SMSs that are coming through to us here. It's quite disturbing SMSs that I want to read. So someone says here, a female staff member asked our CEO for a meeting to voice some concerns that she had. He told her to grow some balls and buy a box of tissues, right? And then the next one, another interesting one, is where does complimenting stop when it comes to harassment? And it's hilarious for me, because these are the kinds of things, it's almost like, you know, women, yeah, okay, I'm not, I will allow you to do the commenting. I'm just the show host. Next, another SMS here. But why call it rape culture is I have a problem with something criminal being upgraded to culture, as generally culture is something we accept. And as a father of a two year old princess, I have a problem with sexual assault being called rape culture instead of rape crimes. And I think this is a big thing, right? It's a language around how we, how we, you know, discuss this topic. And if you don't mind, Fezi, I want us to take a call. And then you can just sort of respond and give us some of your thoughts. And we're going to go over to Ijeoma in Stellenbosch. Ijeoma, it's so good to see you calling in. I feel like all my friends and family are just calling in. It's awesome. We must take the opportunity to do so. This is so exciting. Thanks, Ijeoma. Tell us your thoughts. Yeah, I think most of what I wanted to call in and say has mainly been captured within the past discussion within the past few minutes. But I think what I want to contribute, just from my own personal experiences regarding the discussion is looking specifically, also that the institutional oppression that happens when we discuss rape and you know, how the whole idea of the perpetrator and the victim is played out, and not necessarily taken seriously, and followed through, but also acknowledging the intersectionality where maybe a black woman wants to go and report the rape that happened, but isn't taken as seriously as a white woman. And I think that's something that also needs to be fleshed out and looked at where we see within the broader movement of feminism as well, where we see it almost being captured in a sense by white middle class women taking up the forefront of what a lot of black women have been doing. And just not acknowledging the intersectionality in that. That's one comment I wanted to make. The second one I wanted to talk about was how often there was a specific event that happened in Stellenbosch where the EFF had a march, I think earlier in March. And an incident that happened was one of the women that was protecting the statue, or no, there was a clash basically between AfriForum and other students. And what happened was there were violent, it was a very violent space where members of AfriForum were openly saying things like, oh, don't attack that woman, you know, she's already been raped before, making very sexist and violent comments towards women within these spaces. So I think something that needs to be acknowledged as well that, you know, with this rape culture that we talk about, that there's also a lot of racism that perpetuates these spaces and needs to be looked at. So that's one thing that I wanted to bring across. And I think maybe yesterday, people were following Stellenbosch, University, well, the woman at Stellenbosch University also did a protest, a naked protest in solidarity with the RU reference list. So there is a national call as well, with regards to dealing with this. Definitely. Thanks, Ijeoma. I really appreciate your contributions. And we're gonna head over to some news headlines with Regan Thor. It is 10.30 now. We'll get back and continue the discussion. Thanks. Very good morning to Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba. Has started delivering judgment in the application by the DA to have the decision to withdraw corruption charges against the president set aside. Ledwaba has so far summarized the entire history of the case, going back to the start of the investigation in 2001 and the 2009 decision to scrap the charges. Cabinet's extended Treasury Director General Ongiso Fuzile's contract for another five years. There was speculation late last year that Fuzile was on his way out and made a media report that he was told not to reapply for the position. President Jacob Zuma's reshuffling of finance ministers last December fueled speculation that Fuzile would also be sacked. And the SA National Defense Force says a civilian doctor has been released on bail. He was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two female recruits in Otsuron. The incidents are believed to have occurred at the South African Army Infantry School in Otsuron earlier this month. These stories and much more at 11 rather, or as it happens. EWN Traffic. At the moment there's an accident scene slowing down traffic on the N3 South between London Road and Lynxfield. Traffic on the M2 West is very slow from the Crown Interchange to Main Reef Road. In Little Falls we still have faulty traffic lights at Hendrik Porghieter and Van de Kloof as well as Hendrik Porghieter and Van Staden. We also have faulty traffic lights in Blairgowrie at Conrad and Standard. And in Cape Town roadworks are slowing down traffic on the N1 inbound at Christian Barnard. Karabo Charlie, EWN Traffic.

And I remember this because she's personally one of my friends and she said, I was at the protest and at the statue standing up for my rights. I was threatened with rape and hit by an AfriForum member. The university didn't do anything. That is rape culture. I want to bring in Fezi into the discussion quickly. Fezi, thank you so much for holding all this time. But I mean, you know, Ijeoma raised a very interesting point and that has to do with intersectionality. And how within this struggle, yes, we, you know, we've got all women. But the reality is, of course, that we do have quite a bit of appropriation of the story happening where, you know, the concerns of some groups get to trump the concerns of others. And it's difficult, right? Like it's an ugly discussion to have that, you know, black women can be and queer bodies can be screaming about, you know, rape and rape culture and sexual harassment for days. Then, you know, one person comes up and says, oh, this is what I've been experiencing. And it's a moment. I mean, talk me through this. What are your perspectives on this? You know, I think Ijeoma makes some brilliant points. But I think what she is fantastic in highlighting is A, the institutional component of violence against women and queer bodies. And I think also this conversation about intersectionality. And I think that's currently what we're experiencing at Rhodes ourselves, right? So maybe you want to take us back a little bit in history and think about the Soudin Commission, right? And it was a commission that was set up by the Minister of Higher Education. In the aftermath of the Wrights Fall. And it was an attempt to investigate transformation and institutional culture in higher education institutions, right? And my particular, the reason why I'm interested in this is I'm interested in the submissions that Rhodes made, right? And the Rhodes submission said that the role of sexism and sexual harassment was mostly directly highlighted by the people that were speaking up for Rhodes. And they spoke about the silent and salient features of rape and violence against women as a result of the institutional policies that were captured in Rhodes University management structures and the other various things that make up a university. So already in that moment, I feel like that was an opportunity for the country at large and universities across the board to think seriously about what this thing is, what this violence is, right? And we just don't see that kind of engagement, right? So it's just left in a report. And, you know, it's another thing that gets filed and stored and gets dust on it. But we don't, as universities, come and say, well, actually, what are the policies? What are the structures that need to have patriarchal violence dismantled? But also, yeah, so, and as you say, Joma makes an excellent point about intersectionality, right? I think part of the real horror sometimes of being at Rhodes University is the pervadedness of a system of whiteness, right? And I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about whiteness, right, of a system. And how there's just real erasure of black life, black experiences, black bodies, and how black bodies are often dispensable and are not really taken seriously. And we see that across the country. We see that in our public and political discourse. We see that, for example, in the Oscar Pistorius case and how it became the most important story because that was a conversation about white people. But you also just see that every time you read Sunday Times, there's a very small section about some boy or some girl getting raped in the township. And it kind of normalizes, right? So we see how the media normalizes violence against black bodies. It makes an incredible spectacle when white bodies are on the line. And you see that at Rhodes University as well, right? So we see that there's one particular rape victim story often taken seriously. And I think that's deeply troubling because there are so many students that have come up in these protests. And, you know, for better or for worse, the RE reference list has been out, right? But, you know, you just see throngs of women who have been harassed, who have been violated, who have been brutalized by not only students but academics as well. And also, then you have a management that refuses, to remove and interdict against rape survivors, against people that have spoken up against rape, right? So that's the really deplorable thing about Rhodes University right now is that they are themselves being complicit in a system that wants to violate the bodies of survivors, right? And then there's all this, like, bizarre talk about, hey, no, we're actually doing the right thing. We are following the limits of the Constitution. But, I mean, if a constitution is interested in, in making sure that people don't have dignity, then that's not a constitution that should be taken seriously. You know? And also, I don't want to, I'm not throwing shade at the Constitution. No, I'm with you. It's quite useful. But I think the way in which Rhodes management has interpreted the Constitution is deeply problematic and so telling of the, of just, I'm sorry, the anti-intellectualism that is being fostered in our public spaces but also in our higher education sector and", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.1, "text": " I want to go back to the case, Kwesi's case.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [286, 528,
