{"text": " Fanatics. They invest in ignorance and reject change. In some cases, the attention-grabbing loudest voice. What about the soft-spoken? Today's show addresses that. The oppressed. Women and girls who just might hold the key for peace and global prosperity. My guest, National Geographic Humanitarian Adventurer and Mountain to Mountain founder, Shannon Galpin. Good morning, Shannon, and thanks so much for joining us today on Airwaves. Thanks so much for having me. I'm looking forward to it. There are any number of places I could begin because of your book, Mountain to Mountain. But how about if you start telling us about the projects you've got? Yeah, my organization, Mountain to Mountain, same name, fortunately or unfortunately, started in 2006. And the focus has always been women and girls in conflict zones. And my priority since 2008, when I first started traveling to Afghanistan, has been working with young women, particularly in urban and some rural communities throughout Afghanistan in a variety of areas. It's really evolved. From kind of those traditional looks at midwifery training and girls' education, computer labs and computer training, to really changing my focus as I've been working there to supporting activists. And in particular, the young women, the core artists who are pulling together their own women's organizations and athletes. So I've kind of started to really embody that duality of artist and athlete in the work that I'm doing over there. You used the word activist. That's one of those hot words, key words that to some people means terrorist. And yet I understand that you really believe that you're working within the community or the country and respecting their, well, their environment, their culture, their history. So I'm not clear on activist here. Well, I mean, activists have always been, you know, throughout our own history and others. I mean, they're the people who stand up and speak for what they believe in. They're the people who march in the streets, you know, whether that is for civil rights, women's rights, the environment. I mean, the activists are the ones who take action. And I think that the young activists in Afghanistan that I'm seeing now, I mean, they're unique in that they're kind of the first of their generation in a long time, since the 1980s when the Soviets invaded, to really speak up and say, you know, we want our country, we want to have a role in our country as young, educated young women and young men. And we have a voice. We don't want it to be a country for old men. We want this to be a country that has a future for our generation. And those voices, whether it's through the artists, whether it's through, you know, more traditional activism of marching in the streets, asking for, you know, rights and protesting sexual harassment, you know, whatever that is, those voices, I think, in any country are the most important to support because it's the voices that are trying to be involved. In the system and have a voice in what changes they want to see occur. You know, usually I have a certain direction that I want to go. And there are so many directions in this conversation. I think at this point, I'm just going to be bouncing off of a lot of what you say. Someone, someone, and by the way, your book, Mountain to Mountain, A Journey of Adventure and Activism for the Women of Afghanistan, created quite a bit of conversation, a lot of conversation, stimulating conversations in our house, as well as outside. So I think that that's one of the beauties of your book. And I was telling a woman about it in San Jose who wondered why women have such a hard time moving up in the world, gaining power and sharing their voice. That's a great question. Against gender violence. And I think that what we're seeing is worldwide and a shift and an emphasis to having these conversations about the importance of women having a role, not just in terms of protecting the rights, but in terms of empowering their ability to make choices and to have economic value. What do they have to offer that men don't have to offer? I don't think it's so much what they have that men don't. I think it's that we're half the population. And I think that we have certainly differing views, you know, as everyone does, whether that's male or female. But I think that the issue has been, do women have equality? Do women have the same access that men do? And that around the world has proven that no, we don't. And why wouldn't we? So are you kind of a suffrage advocate here? Is that where we're going? You're a Susan B. Anthony? You know, I certainly, the more I have looked back at the women who have come before me, the more I am certainly hugely appreciative and a huge fan of women like Susan B. Anthony and those that fought for our rights in the U.S. to have a right to vote, to have a right to make choices. I think no matter where you are in the world, whether that's Afghanistan, which is repeatedly ranked the worst place in the world to be a woman, or whether you're in the U.S. or Europe, where women have much more freedoms, much more rights, you still see a lack of equity, you know, or a lack of equality, excuse me. And you see high rates of gender violence against women. You see women oppressed around the world. And even in the U.S., where women have, you know, the same rights under the law as men, you still see huge disparities, whether that's, you know, that are based on gender. And that's, I think, surprising me more and more as I dive deeper into my own country. Your own country being America versus Germany or anywhere else? Exactly. What is the present situation in Afghanistan since you've mentioned that country a few times? For women's rights? Well, my sense, and I recall in your book, Mountain to Mountain, you feel that we have, we here in America who've not visited that region, have a really warped sense of reality over there. What I think of is a rather untamed, if you will, remote area with inconstant conflict. Uphievals, fanatics, Taliban fighters, et cetera, et cetera. You're not wrong. Definitely. You know, a lot of people joke that, you know, it is still very wild and untamed. I mean, I think more than that, you know, it's a country that's endured four decades of war and destruction. And so, you know, a country that has had, you know, layer upon layer of destruction of infrastructure, of, you know, kind of the rural communities that are tied together. And now you have extreme poverty, extreme oppression. You have a country that's still fighting the Taliban that has a very strong youth presence that has come through in the last 12 years, you have a youth population in those urban areas that are educated, that want to have a role, that want to see a peaceful society, you know, that want their government to work and to function better and to protect them better. And you have the possibility of a very different future. I think that what I have been seeing is certainly this year in particular, security has been deteriorating again over the last couple of years. And this year in particular, we've had a very tumultuous election process. Ghani was inaugurated on Monday. It created a rule for Abdullah Abdullah as, you know, a member of this unity government. And now they can refocus attention and go forward as to how do we move this country forward. But it is a country that, you know, is at a turning point in many ways. And yet my sense here on some of what you're saying is a country without a consistency, especially of an infrastructure. My immediate response is it's a country without a future. Well, I think they certainly have a future. I mean, every country has the potential to have a future. And Afghanistan has made incredible progress in the last 10 to 12 years since the Taliban were pushed out of control by establishing their new constitution, by having free elections, by incredible access for women and girls that, you know, that is at risk of sliding backwards. But you have women running for president, women running for members of parliament. You have women coming into the legal system as doctors and lawyers and you've got teachers. And you have a society that is continuing to be resilient and to continue to rebuild time and time again. But 40 decades, sorry, four decades of war on your on your land, on your on your country means that it takes more than 10 or 12 years to rebuild that. And I think they've made enormous gains. But the fact that security is still a major issue means that so many of those gains are precarious. Yeah. And when I say no future, I'm thinking that's just a it's enticing for other countries to take that country over that country, meaning any country that has no consistent infrastructure. That's where I go with that. And when I listen to your TED talk, you you pointed out one of the women, well, actually a couple who wanted to be educated and one who was a journalist and she's assassinated. You know, to speak out in a country that that basically is just totally an upheaval, apparently. I can't imagine why we'd want to encourage women to speak up and lose their lives. I think that's always at the heart of it. At the end of the day, change does not happen by playing it safe. All change comes with upheaval. And if you do not speak out, nothing will change. And so the alternative is, oh, OK, so I'm going to sit back and be, you know, be forced to wear a burqa or be not allowed to leave my home without a male escort, not be allowed to work or to go to school and essentially be, you know, a modern day slave when we're looking at that particular storyline, you know, women's rights. And I think, you know, so it means that women have to. We'll have to speak out. Women are the ones that are going to change that because no one's going to give that to you. OK, but Shannon, excuse me. Is that is that that role of speaking out something that can work within the system so that they're not killed and assassinated? Well, there's Martin Luther King. I mean, everyone who speaks out and essentially bucks that status quo, no matter what country you're in, takes that risk that someone will not fight back with words and debate, but will fight back with this or guns. And that is a hugely unfortunate consequence of trying to speak up and trying to to change things. And it's certainly something that, you know, I wish was not the case. I wish that, you know, women could speak up around the world with absolutely no consequence of violence against them. But the violence is there regardless. And so the women that are speaking out, a great example is there's a parliamentarian, Fazia Kufi. She was on The Daily Show.

They invest in ignorance and reject change. In some cases, the attention-grabbing loudest voice. What about the soft-spoken? Today's show addresses that. The oppressed. Women and girls who just might hold the key for peace and global prosperity. My guest, National Geographic Humanitarian Adventurer and Mountain to Mountain founder, Shannon Galpin. Good morning, Shannon, and thanks so much for joining us today on Airwaves. Thanks so much for having me. I'm looking forward to it. There are any number of places I could begin because of your book, Mountain to Mountain. But how about if you start telling us about the projects you've got? Yeah, my organization, Mountain to Mountain, same name, fortunately or unfortunately, started in 2006. And the focus has always been women and girls in conflict zones. And my priority since 2008, when I first started traveling to Afghanistan, has been working with young women, particularly in urban and some rural communities throughout Afghanistan in a variety of areas. It's really evolved. From kind of those traditional looks at midwifery training and girls' education, computer labs and computer training, to really changing my focus as I've been working there to supporting activists. And in particular, the young women, the core artists who are pulling together their own women's organizations and athletes. So I've kind of started to really embody that duality of artist and athlete in the work that I'm doing over there. You used the word activist. That's one of those hot words, key words that to some people means terrorist. And yet I understand that you really believe that you're working within the community or the country and respecting their, well, their environment, their culture, their history. So I'm not clear on activist here. Well, I mean, activists have always been, you know, throughout our own history and others. I mean, they're the people who stand up and speak for what they believe in. They're the people who march in the streets, you know, whether that is for civil rights, women's rights, the environment. I mean, the activists are the ones who take action. And I think that the young activists in Afghanistan that I'm seeing now, I mean, they're unique in that they're kind of the first of their generation in a long time, since the 1980s when the Soviets invaded, to really speak up and say, you know, we want our country, we want to have a role in our country as young, educated young women and young men. And we have a voice. We don't want it to be a country for old men. We want this to be a country that has a future for our generation. And those voices, whether it's through the artists, whether it's through, you know, more traditional activism of marching in the streets, asking for, you know, rights and protesting sexual harassment, you know, whatever that is, those voices, I think, in any country are the most important to support because it's the voices that are trying to be involved. In the system and have a voice in what changes they want to see occur. You know, usually I have a certain direction that I want to go. And there are so many directions in this conversation. I think at this point, I'm just going to be bouncing off of a lot of what you say. Someone, someone, and by the way, your book, Mountain to Mountain, A Journey of Adventure and Activism for the Women of Afghanistan, created quite a bit of conversation, a lot of conversation, stimulating conversations in our house, as well as outside. So I think that that's one of the beauties of your book. And I was telling a woman about it in San Jose who wondered why women have such a hard time moving up in the world, gaining power and sharing their voice. That's a great question. Against gender violence. And I think that what we're seeing is worldwide and a shift and an emphasis to having these conversations about the importance of women having a role, not just in terms of protecting the rights, but in terms of empowering their ability to make choices and to have economic value. What do they have to offer that men don't have to offer? I don't think it's so much what they have that men don't. I think it's that we're half the population. And I think that we have certainly differing views, you know, as everyone does, whether that's male or female. But I think that the issue has been, do women have equality? Do women have the same access that men do? And that around the world has proven that no, we don't. And why wouldn't we? So are you kind of a suffrage advocate here? Is that where we're going? You're a Susan B. Anthony? You know, I certainly, the more I have looked back at the women who have come before me, the more I am certainly hugely appreciative and a huge fan of women like Susan B. Anthony and those that fought for our rights in the U.S. to have a right to vote, to have a right to make choices. I think no matter where you are in the world, whether that's Afghanistan, which is repeatedly ranked the worst place in the world to be a woman, or whether you're in the U.S. or Europe, where women have much more freedoms, much more rights, you still see a lack of equity, you know, or a lack of equality, excuse me. And you see high rates of gender violence against women. You see women oppressed around the world. And even in the U.S., where women have, you know, the same rights under the law as men, you still see huge disparities, whether that's, you know, that are based on gender. And that's, I think, surprising me more and more as I dive deeper into my own country. Your own country being America versus Germany or anywhere else? Exactly. What is the present situation in Afghanistan since you've mentioned that country a few times? For women's rights? Well, my sense, and I recall in your book, Mountain to Mountain, you feel that we have, we here in America who've not visited that region, have a really warped sense of reality over there. What I think of is a rather untamed, if you will, remote area with inconstant conflict. Uphievals, fanatics, Taliban fighters, et cetera, et cetera. You're not wrong. Definitely. You know, a lot of people joke that, you know, it is still very wild and untamed. I mean, I think more than that, you know, it's a country that's endured four decades of war and destruction. And so, you know, a country that has had, you know, layer upon layer of destruction of infrastructure, of, you know, kind of the rural communities that are tied together. And now you have extreme poverty, extreme oppression. You have a country that's still fighting the Taliban that has a very strong youth presence that has come through in the last 12 years, you have a youth population in those urban areas that are educated, that want to have a role, that want to see a peaceful society, you know, that want their government to work and to function better and to protect them better. And you have the possibility of a very different future. I think that what I have been seeing is certainly this year in particular, security has been deteriorating again over the last couple of years. And this year in particular, we've had a very tumultuous election process. Ghani was inaugurated on Monday. It created a rule for Abdullah Abdullah as, you know, a member of this unity government. And now they can refocus attention and go forward as to how do we move this country forward. But it is a country that, you know, is at a turning point in many ways. And yet my sense here on some of what you're saying is a country without a consistency, especially of an infrastructure. My immediate response is it's a country without a future. Well, I think they certainly have a future. I mean, every country has the potential to have a future. And Afghanistan has made incredible progress in the last 10 to 12 years since the Taliban were pushed out of control by establishing their new constitution, by having free elections, by incredible access for women and girls that, you know, that is at risk of sliding backwards. But you have women running for president, women running for members of parliament. You have women coming into the legal system as doctors and lawyers and you've got teachers. And you have a society that is continuing to be resilient and to continue to rebuild time and time again. But 40 decades, sorry, four decades of war on your on your land, on your on your country means that it takes more than 10 or 12 years to rebuild that. And I think they've made enormous gains. But the fact that security is still a major issue means that so many of those gains are precarious. Yeah. And when I say no future, I'm thinking that's just a it's enticing for other countries to take that country over that country, meaning any country that has no consistent infrastructure. That's where I go with that. And when I listen to your TED talk, you you pointed out one of the women, well, actually a couple who wanted to be educated and one who was a journalist and she's assassinated. You know, to speak out in a country that that basically is just totally an upheaval, apparently. I can't imagine why we'd want to encourage women to speak up and lose their lives. I think that's always at the heart of it. At the end of the day, change does not happen by playing it safe. All change comes with upheaval. And if you do not speak out, nothing will change. And so the alternative is, oh, OK, so I'm going to sit back and be, you know, be forced to wear a burqa or be not allowed to leave my home without a male escort, not be allowed to work or to go to school and essentially be, you know, a modern day slave when we're looking at that particular storyline, you know, women's rights. And I think, you know, so it means that women have to. We'll have to speak out. Women are the ones that are going to change that because no one's going to give that to you. OK, but Shannon, excuse me. Is that is that that role of speaking out something that can work within the system so that they're not killed and assassinated? Well, there's Martin Luther King. I mean, everyone who speaks out and essentially bucks that status quo, no matter what country you're in, takes that risk that someone will not fight back with words and debate, but will fight back with this or guns. And that is a hugely unfortunate consequence of trying to speak up and trying to to change things. And it's certainly something that, you know, I wish was not the case. I wish that, you know, women could speak up around the world with absolutely no consequence of violence against them. But the violence is there regardless. And so the women that are speaking out, a great example is there's a parliamentarian, Fazia Kufi. She was on The Daily Show. She had a bestselling book in the U.S. She's Afghan, born and raised in Badakhshan.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.72, "end": 1.2, "text": " Fanatics.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [18564, 30292, 13],
