{"text": " Okay, now we're recording. Do you want to try talking? Just... Um... Hi. This'll be the part that you cut out. Exactly. I'm gonna put this as a blooper at the end. I feel like our blooper, like our test phrase should be, tell us about Rupert Graves Benedict. Oh, good idea! It's our test phrase. Okay, um... Okay, should I be serious now? Yes. Okay. So, before we begin talking about Irene Adler in her many different incarnations, since this is our first podcast, we thought that we would talk a little bit about who we were. I was going to talk about how I got into the Holmes stories and sort of where we're coming from in our approach to this podcast. I'm Corinna, and Lena gives me a lot of questions to answer. That's how this works. Um... The thing is, I can't actually remember a time when I didn't know who Sherlock Holmes was, and I feel this probably had a lot to do with the fact that my mother watched nothing but PBS Mystery for the first six years of my life, so that was always playing in the background, and a lot of that was Jeremy Brett Holmes. I read an abridged version of Hound of the Baskervilles at age six, and then the real version... Hold on! Yeah, then there were pictures of a giant death hound, and then I read a real version at age eight, and thought it was super cool that you had these Victorian dudes who were friends, and they would investigate crimes and write letters back and forth. The funny thing is, as much as I enjoyed reading Holmes stories sort of here and there, patchwork throughout my childhood, I never quite did the Mark Gatiss thing, where I just read through the whole canon. It was really patchwork. It's like I'd pick up a book and read a story here and there, and it's only very recently that I've taken all of the stories, sort of read them through, and I think that's because they've suddenly become relevant to my life in a lot of ways. How so? So, also, you know, like, BBC Sherlock has put it in the forefront of my brain. That's the show. Oh, well, same here. Right. I think that's happened to a lot of us. Right. I feel like it's the show I've been waiting for all my life, in a weird way. Also, even just sort of the Robert Downey Jr. movies, I'm like, yeah, I should actually read the book from beginning to end, and now here I am analyzing them on a podcast. So, I guess I'd like to talk about a bit of, or insert a bit of a disclaimer here. I'm not actually a Victorianist, which is to say, I've studied, I've looked at, read a lot of about the Victorian era, and I've read a lot of books set in the Victorian era, and I'm an enthusiast for all kinds of history, the Victorian era included, but what I mean by I am not a Victorianist is I don't actually have an academic degree studying Victorian history or Victorian literature. So, I'm going to try and get as much correct as possible, and I have annotated editions of the Sherlock Holmes books, and I end up sort of reading a lot of things, but at the same time, I welcome constructive criticism. Because I'm probably going to get things wrong. So, also, you shouldn't take what I say as a complete 100% authority. I'm going to try and get my information from good places, but I might not be perfect. So, ass is covered. Yay! That said, I want to talk a little bit about my actual academic training. That's in Classics. I went to a small liberal arts college for women, which is probably why I got interested in podcasting from a feminist perspective and from a queer studies perspective. So, I studied a lot of Greco-Roman things, and I spent a lot of time analyzing texts, and a lot of what I did my coursework in was Greek and Roman mythology, and then world mythology, and just a lot of mythology. I bring this up because I'm probably going to be approaching the Sherlock Holmes stories not as a canon, but as a modern mythology. There's been so many adaptations of Holmes over the years that he's sort of grown beyond what Doyle originally wrote about him, and I think that's really cool. So, I'm going to take sort of a mythographer's approach to the Sherlock Holmes stories. So, we're not necessarily going to be taking an adaptation of a Doyle story and sort of comparing it point by point and then scoring it based on how well it did. Although, we will sort of compare different versions of canon, but we're going to sort of look at different adaptations of the Holmes canon. We're going to look at the modern BBC series. We're going to look at Robert Downey Jr. We're going to look at Jeremy Brett. Wishbone. Wishbone. Wishbone has just come up as something that has done Sherlock Holmes, and it was my childhood. So, we will talk about Wishbone. And we're going to focus specifically on gender and sexuality, and we're going to compare a lot of canons, and we're going to look at not, you know, did this happen or did this not happen, but why are specific adaptations making the choices that they make? What about the time in which they're being adapted tends to result in that? Does that sound like a pretty good description? Of what we're doing, Lena? That sounds brilliant. Okay. Thank you. I would do a cute little smile here, but you can't actually see it. But you can picture Benedict Cumberbatch in your head doing it, so it's okay. Yes, except I'm not actually awesome and... Well, but our listeners don't know that. They haven't seen our pictures. Okay, we don't have to tell them I'm not a secret ginger. Okay. Um, I guess it's your turn to introduce yourselves. Hi, everybody. This is Lena. Hi. Lena will tell you about herself. Um, I don't know anything. I'm just here to be a conductor of light. That's a lie. I don't... I'm also not a Victorianist, and I did not study classics. I studied linguistics, which is not at all relevant to anything we're going to be talking about on this podcast. I took a women's studies class once, but I learned a lot of about gender and sexuality studies just from my friends on the internet. So, I don't have a lot of relevant formal training, but I do get really, really enthusiastic about things, and I have opinions, and I think about things a lot. So... Oh, and I'm a writer, almost by profession. Technically, I haven't been paid for writing yet, but I'm getting there, so I'm the writer half, like John Watson. Yes. Of course, I write things, too, but... And, like, honestly, you wrote... You wrote our intro post and the bios in the sidebar. Sometimes... I'm just here to appreciate it. Sometimes Lena is just a little straged. She's sitting there eating a donut. Yeah. But really, we have our other friend, Steve, who is sort of our little straged slash Stanford. She introduced us and was like, do a podcast, and... But at the same time, she kind of... She helps us... Deal with the world, I guess. She's our marketing manager. Let's go with that. Yes. Yes. So... Hi, Steve! We know you're out there! Hi, Steve! Okay, continue, Lena. I probably interrupted you. Um, let's see. Uh, other relevant information about me. Um... Well... I'm mainly... I just really got obsessed with the BBC show, and so that made me get interested in Sherlock Holmes in general, which... I mean... Sherlock Holmes was cool before. Like, the first Holmes story I ever read, I was, like, in middle school, and I was like, this is cool! This guy, he's really experiment. You know, because I was in middle school, and that's what I took away from it. You know, the bare bones. And... Uh... I guess just at the beginning of this year, I started watching the show, and it became way cooler than just that, so... And now I get to assign you all the reading. Yes. All the reading. Yes, and... I have to... It's been a lot of fun. I've had to do all this research for this podcast. Read Scandal in Bohemia, watched Scandal in Bohemia with Jeremy Brant, re-watched the first Robert Downey Jr. movie. And now we have to watch Wishbone, because we just found out... Yes! Hey! Should we segue into our list of adaptations? Oh, yes! Let's do that. Alright, so... I guess we'll introduce... So... We are, over the course of this podcast, we're gonna be covering four different versions of the Adler story. There's other... There's billions of extant Adler stories. Um... But we decided we'd focus in on sort of the core four, and maybe we'll talk about others. Um... So... First of all, we're gonna be covering Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Scandal in Bohemia. Are you guys surprised that we would tackle that one? Well, we're gonna tackle the original. Um... And... The Scandal in Bohemia was the first short story of the Sherlock Holmes stories to exist. Before, there had been two novels. We had A Study in Scarlet, and we had The Sign of Four. Um... A Study in Scarlet introduces Holmes and his deductions and his relationship with Watson. In Sign of Four, the story continues, and we get Mary Moore Stan introduced, and she and Watson marry at the end. Um... So... You know... Sign of Four has sort of looked at, you know, Watson and his relationship with a woman, and it has probably left the readers with questions about, you know, is Holmes going to get married? What's going to go on? So Scandal in Bohemia does kind of answer that question in a way. Um... Let's see. It was first published in The Strand in July 1891, for those of you trivia buffs out there. Um... I just want to say, now, just for the moment, those of you out there who have not read Doyle's Scandal in Bohemia yet, please pause this podcast, pick up a copy, you can get it on Project Gutenberg, just read through it. I don't say this because I'm an elitist and think you need to be able to read the story to listen to our podcast. I'm saying it because it's really awesome, and you should definitely give it a try. And it's pretty short, so it won't even take you very long. Yes! You can come right back here. Pause it, and we'll wait, and then... Well, I mean, metaphorically, we'll wait, and then we'll come back, we'll talk about it, and it'll be more fun that way. Um... We're going to, I guess, let's go chronologically. Um... We're going to talk about the Granada adaptation, um... And this is from the Granada series, which was an adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories that came around in the 1980s. Um... The Granada adaptation of Scandal in Bohemia came out in April, uh, 1984. And it was the very first episode of the series. So I think the fact that this was the very first episode just shows how interested people are in, uh, Irene as a character, and how much she's sort of a selling point for the Holmes franchise. Um... In this version, uh, she was portrayed by Gail Honeycutt, and of course, Sherlock Holmes was Jeremy Brett. Anything more we should say about that? It was some guy whose name, though, I'm bothered to say that. No! David Burke! Give David Burke some credit! He does really awesome bitch face when Holmes doesn't like his writing. So... Um... And he's the source of the Watson gif, so... Very, very important. Um... Moving on! Uh, we're going to focus on Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movie from 2009. Correct me if I'm wrong, Lena. 2009? I didn't know I had to do research into, like, dates and shit. Okay, well, I'm guessing... Are we allowed to swear on this show? Let's just say yes for now. We can bleep it out later. Um... Okay. I'm gonna say it was December 2009, because I remember that being a terrible winter, and my mom took me to see this movie to cheer me up. She said, I think she just wanted to perv on Robert Downey Jr. Um... So, Irene Adler, they don't actually adapt to the scandal in Bohemia in the Sherlock Holmes movie of 2009, but Irene Adler does feature as a character, and she is portrayed by Rachel McAdams. Rachel McFucking Adams. Rachel McFucking Adams. Yeah, I guess we are gonna swear, because that's her name. It is. Um... So... So, the... Blah. We're gonna cut this out. Okay, so... Um... So, this is actually a really good look at what happens when you take Irene Adler out of the scandal in Bohemia story, um, because I do think it affects the portrayal of her character. Would you agree, Lena? Yes. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna... We're gonna... We're gonna list... At the end, we're gonna go into, like, pros and cons of the different versions of Irene, so we'll get into that. Yes. Finally, of course, we have to touch on BBC Sherlock, so we're gonna cover, um, Scandal in Belgravia from 2012, the very beginning of 2012. It is their New Year's episode. Um... Scandal in Belgravia updates, uh, Scandal in Bohemia to the modern day, for better or for worse. Well, that's sort of the question. Um... And these episodes, uh, Irene is played by Lara Pulver. Um... And you guys probably all know that Sherlock Holmes is Benedict Cumberbatch, because we've sort of already brought him up. That'll happen a lot, I think. Vatican cameos! Yes. Where were we? Right. So, we've sort of gone through all of our adaptations now. Um... At the end of the episode, we're gonna do a pros and cons list with each adaptation, with sort of our overall feelings or feels for the episode. The Tumblr literate crowd. Um... And we hope that'll sort of sum up our ideas about Irene and sort of where they go with her character, um, over these three adaptations. And sort of who is Irene Adler? Do we know? We really need dramatic music or something here. Okay. Um... So, that's about it, and I guess we'll move into our discussion. Okay!

Do you want to try talking? Just... Um... Hi. This'll be the part that you cut out. Exactly. I'm gonna put this as a blooper at the end. I feel like our blooper, like our test phrase should be, tell us about Rupert Graves Benedict. Oh, good idea! It's our test phrase. Okay, um... Okay, should I be serious now? Yes. Okay. So, before we begin talking about Irene Adler in her many different incarnations, since this is our first podcast, we thought that we would talk a little bit about who we were. I was going to talk about how I got into the Holmes stories and sort of where we're coming from in our approach to this podcast. I'm Corinna, and Lena gives me a lot of questions to answer. That's how this works. Um... The thing is, I can't actually remember a time when I didn't know who Sherlock Holmes was, and I feel this probably had a lot to do with the fact that my mother watched nothing but PBS Mystery for the first six years of my life, so that was always playing in the background, and a lot of that was Jeremy Brett Holmes. I read an abridged version of Hound of the Baskervilles at age six, and then the real version... Hold on! Yeah, then there were pictures of a giant death hound, and then I read a real version at age eight, and thought it was super cool that you had these Victorian dudes who were friends, and they would investigate crimes and write letters back and forth. The funny thing is, as much as I enjoyed reading Holmes stories sort of here and there, patchwork throughout my childhood, I never quite did the Mark Gatiss thing, where I just read through the whole canon. It was really patchwork. It's like I'd pick up a book and read a story here and there, and it's only very recently that I've taken all of the stories, sort of read them through, and I think that's because they've suddenly become relevant to my life in a lot of ways. How so? So, also, you know, like, BBC Sherlock has put it in the forefront of my brain. That's the show. Oh, well, same here. Right. I think that's happened to a lot of us. Right. I feel like it's the show I've been waiting for all my life, in a weird way. Also, even just sort of the Robert Downey Jr. movies, I'm like, yeah, I should actually read the book from beginning to end, and now here I am analyzing them on a podcast. So, I guess I'd like to talk about a bit of, or insert a bit of a disclaimer here. I'm not actually a Victorianist, which is to say, I've studied, I've looked at, read a lot of about the Victorian era, and I've read a lot of books set in the Victorian era, and I'm an enthusiast for all kinds of history, the Victorian era included, but what I mean by I am not a Victorianist is I don't actually have an academic degree studying Victorian history or Victorian literature. So, I'm going to try and get as much correct as possible, and I have annotated editions of the Sherlock Holmes books, and I end up sort of reading a lot of things, but at the same time, I welcome constructive criticism. Because I'm probably going to get things wrong. So, also, you shouldn't take what I say as a complete 100% authority. I'm going to try and get my information from good places, but I might not be perfect. So, ass is covered. Yay! That said, I want to talk a little bit about my actual academic training. That's in Classics. I went to a small liberal arts college for women, which is probably why I got interested in podcasting from a feminist perspective and from a queer studies perspective. So, I studied a lot of Greco-Roman things, and I spent a lot of time analyzing texts, and a lot of what I did my coursework in was Greek and Roman mythology, and then world mythology, and just a lot of mythology. I bring this up because I'm probably going to be approaching the Sherlock Holmes stories not as a canon, but as a modern mythology. There's been so many adaptations of Holmes over the years that he's sort of grown beyond what Doyle originally wrote about him, and I think that's really cool. So, I'm going to take sort of a mythographer's approach to the Sherlock Holmes stories. So, we're not necessarily going to be taking an adaptation of a Doyle story and sort of comparing it point by point and then scoring it based on how well it did. Although, we will sort of compare different versions of canon, but we're going to sort of look at different adaptations of the Holmes canon. We're going to look at the modern BBC series. We're going to look at Robert Downey Jr. We're going to look at Jeremy Brett. Wishbone. Wishbone. Wishbone has just come up as something that has done Sherlock Holmes, and it was my childhood. So, we will talk about Wishbone. And we're going to focus specifically on gender and sexuality, and we're going to compare a lot of canons, and we're going to look at not, you know, did this happen or did this not happen, but why are specific adaptations making the choices that they make? What about the time in which they're being adapted tends to result in that? Does that sound like a pretty good description? Of what we're doing, Lena? That sounds brilliant. Okay. Thank you. I would do a cute little smile here, but you can't actually see it. But you can picture Benedict Cumberbatch in your head doing it, so it's okay. Yes, except I'm not actually awesome and... Well, but our listeners don't know that. They haven't seen our pictures. Okay, we don't have to tell them I'm not a secret ginger. Okay. Um, I guess it's your turn to introduce yourselves. Hi, everybody. This is Lena. Hi. Lena will tell you about herself. Um, I don't know anything. I'm just here to be a conductor of light. That's a lie. I don't... I'm also not a Victorianist, and I did not study classics. I studied linguistics, which is not at all relevant to anything we're going to be talking about on this podcast. I took a women's studies class once, but I learned a lot of about gender and sexuality studies just from my friends on the internet. So, I don't have a lot of relevant formal training, but I do get really, really enthusiastic about things, and I have opinions, and I think about things a lot. So... Oh, and I'm a writer, almost by profession. Technically, I haven't been paid for writing yet, but I'm getting there, so I'm the writer half, like John Watson. Yes. Of course, I write things, too, but... And, like, honestly, you wrote... You wrote our intro post and the bios in the sidebar. Sometimes... I'm just here to appreciate it. Sometimes Lena is just a little straged. She's sitting there eating a donut. Yeah. But really, we have our other friend, Steve, who is sort of our little straged slash Stanford. She introduced us and was like, do a podcast, and... But at the same time, she kind of... She helps us... Deal with the world, I guess. She's our marketing manager. Let's go with that. Yes. Yes. So... Hi, Steve! We know you're out there! Hi, Steve! Okay, continue, Lena. I probably interrupted you. Um, let's see. Uh, other relevant information about me. Um... Well... I'm mainly... I just really got obsessed with the BBC show, and so that made me get interested in Sherlock Holmes in general, which... I mean... Sherlock Holmes was cool before. Like, the first Holmes story I ever read, I was, like, in middle school, and I was like, this is cool! This guy, he's really experiment. You know, because I was in middle school, and that's what I took away from it. You know, the bare bones. And... Uh... I guess just at the beginning of this year, I started watching the show, and it became way cooler than just that, so... And now I get to assign you all the reading. Yes. All the reading. Yes, and... I have to... It's been a lot of fun. I've had to do all this research for this podcast. Read Scandal in Bohemia, watched Scandal in Bohemia with Jeremy Brant, re-watched the first Robert Downey Jr. movie. And now we have to watch Wishbone, because we just found out... Yes! Hey! Should we segue into our list of adaptations? Oh, yes! Let's do that. Alright, so... I guess we'll introduce... So... We are, over the course of this podcast, we're gonna be covering four different versions of the Adler story. There's other... There's billions of extant Adler stories. Um... But we decided we'd focus in on sort of the core four, and maybe we'll talk about others. Um... So... First of all, we're gonna be covering Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Scandal in Bohemia. Are you guys surprised that we would tackle that one? Well, we're gonna tackle the original. Um... And... The Scandal in Bohemia was the first short story of the Sherlock Holmes stories to exist. Before, there had been two novels. We had A Study in Scarlet, and we had The Sign of Four. Um... A Study in Scarlet introduces Holmes and his deductions and his relationship with Watson. In Sign of Four, the story continues, and we get Mary Moore Stan introduced, and she and Watson marry at the end. Um... So... You know... Sign of Four has sort of looked at, you know, Watson and his relationship with a woman, and it has probably left the readers with questions about, you know, is Holmes going to get married? What's going to go on? So Scandal in Bohemia does kind of answer that question in a way. Um... Let's see. It was first published in The Strand in July 1891, for those of you trivia buffs out there. Um... I just want to say, now, just for the moment, those of you out there who have not read Doyle's Scandal in Bohemia yet, please pause this podcast, pick up a copy, you can get it on Project Gutenberg, just read through it. I don't say this because I'm an elitist and think you need to be able to read the story to listen to our podcast. I'm saying it because it's really awesome, and you should definitely give it a try. And it's pretty short, so it won't even take you very long. Yes! You can come right back here. Pause it, and we'll wait, and then... Well, I mean, metaphorically, we'll wait, and then we'll come back, we'll talk about it, and it'll be more fun that way. Um... We're going to, I guess, let's go chronologically. Um... We're going to talk about the Granada adaptation, um... And this is from the Granada series, which was an adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories that came around in the 1980s. Um... The Granada adaptation of Scandal in Bohemia came out in April, uh, 1984. And it was the very first episode of the series. So I think the fact that this was the very first episode just shows how interested people are in, uh, Irene as a character, and how much she's sort of a selling point for the Holmes franchise. Um... In this version, uh, she was portrayed by Gail Honeycutt, and of course, Sherlock Holmes was Jeremy Brett. Anything more we should say about that? It was some guy whose name, though, I'm bothered to say that. No! David Burke! Give David Burke some credit! He does really awesome bitch face when Holmes doesn't like his writing. So... Um... And he's the source of the Watson gif, so... Very, very important. Um... Moving on! Uh, we're going to focus on Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movie from 2009. Correct me if I'm wrong, Lena. 2009? I didn't know I had to do research into, like, dates and shit. Okay, well, I'm guessing... Are we allowed to swear on this show? Let's just say yes for now. We can bleep it out later. Um... Okay. I'm gonna say it was December 2009, because I remember that being a terrible winter, and my mom took me to see this movie to cheer me up. She said, I think she just wanted to perv on Robert Downey Jr. Um... So, Irene Adler, they don't actually adapt to the scandal in Bohemia in the Sherlock Holmes movie of 2009, but Irene Adler does feature as a character, and she is portrayed by Rachel McAdams. Rachel McFucking Adams. Rachel McFucking Adams. Yeah, I guess we are gonna swear, because that's her name. It is. Um... So... So, the... Blah. We're gonna cut this out. Okay, so... Um... So, this is actually a really good look at what happens when you take Irene Adler out of the scandal in Bohemia story, um, because I do think it affects the portrayal of her character. Would you agree, Lena? Yes. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna... We're gonna... We're gonna list... At the end, we're gonna go into, like, pros and cons of the different versions of Irene, so we'll get into that. Yes. Finally, of course, we have to touch on BBC Sherlock, so we're gonna cover, um, Scandal in Belgravia from 2012, the very beginning of 2012. It is their New Year's episode. Um... Scandal in Belgravia updates, uh, Scandal in Bohemia to the modern day, for better or for worse. Well, that's sort of the question. Um... And these episodes, uh, Irene is played by Lara Pulver. Um... And you guys probably all know that Sherlock Holmes is Benedict Cumberbatch, because we've sort of already brought him up. That'll happen a lot, I think. Vatican cameos! Yes. Where were we? Right. So, we've sort of gone through all of our adaptations now. Um... At the end of the episode, we're gonna do a pros and cons list with each adaptation, with sort of our overall feelings or feels for the episode. The Tumblr literate crowd. Um... And we hope that'll sort of sum up our ideas about Irene and sort of where they go with her character, um, over these three adaptations. And sort of who is Irene Adler? Do we know? We really need dramatic music or something here. Okay. Um... So, that's about it, and I guess we'll move into our discussion. Okay!
