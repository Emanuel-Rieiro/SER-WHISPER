{"text": " But let me ask you a question. What are you doing in your salon as a wig maker? So if you're out here and you're making wigs, when people walk into your salon, they should see wigs everywhere. I mean, you should have doll heads on top of cabinets. I'm talking doll heads on top of display cases. I'm talking you should have wigs everywhere. And these wigs should have a price tag. Meaning if somebody just wants to come in your shop, they see a wig and they want to buy it right off the mannequin head, you should be able to sell it to them, whether they can fit it or not. That's an opportunity for you to have a wig station for them to try on the wig properly. And then you'll be able to offer an additional service by cutting that wig and customizing it to fit their face. And you're going to have those people that can fit it and maybe not fit it. So then that means you buy canvases to make your wigs in different sizes. So if you have one wig out on display and it's a red bob, you should have a couple of different sizes of red bob wigs in the back for retail. So there are many different ways that we can get into retailing wigs. We can also retail wigs that may be at a lower price point. These are things that we have to think about because the beauty supply stores are doing it and they're getting all of our money. So we got to bring this thing back. So I don't want you to look at yourself as a wig maker anymore. I want you to look at yourself as a wig retailer. And with that being said, who knows if you can get into your own wig retail business and you start selling wigs to other salon owners who are simply not interested in making wigs at all. You know what I mean? I mean, it's literally all about you forming relationships with other salon owners. And guess what? That can happen. So I just need us to think about the whole wig retail thing as a product. This is a product that you're producing, a product that you're selling, a product that people are going to tell somebody else where they got it from. And who knows? You might start getting people walking in the door and all they want to do is buy wigs. You may change a portion of your salon to where you separate it and have like a salon on this side and a wig retail business on this side. If that is what it is that you're doing, if you see that you're making good money at it, why not sit down and come up with a plan? And I'm going to talk about these P's. Come up with a plan that you can put forth that you can start making this residual income because that's what retailing is. You're bringing in residual income into your salon, getting you from behind the chair and not having to struggle and stress your body out to make money. I mean, it's really not that easy. It's difficult. So whether you be the stylist who makes the wigs, whether you be the stylist who buys wigs, whether you are the stylist who's making custom wigs, it don't matter. You need to be making sure that you are pushing your retail in your salon with your wigs all day, every day. There should not be a moment to where people are not seeing wigs. If you're all on Instagram saying that I sell wigs or I make wigs, let's just go ahead and make this a full-fledged wig retail business. Okay? And name your line. Name your wig line. You know what I mean? If you want to name it after your salon or whatever, come up with a name and do your thing. Like, just do you. So what, everybody out there selling wigs? There is something different that it is that you're doing that should make somebody else want to buy your product. So you got to figure out what that is. I don't know your niche. I don't know your thing. If it's cutting blunt cuts, if that's your thing, that's it. Focus on that. Come up with your own, like, style and your own niche that people know you for. If you're good at razor cuts, razor cut all your wigs. Show people that you're razor cutting your wigs. Do little demos in the salon. Have your area set up to where your clients are walking by and they're like, oh, she's making a wig. Like, let people see some of the process. Don't hide yourself away in the shop. Like, I used to do a little thing and I would just have this one station and it was just up for makeup, right? So that way we could introduce this makeup line at the time I was using. We could introduce the makeup line to the client so they could get their hair done and then we would offer, like, a free eyeshadow makeover. So now I set that area up and they would see it when they walked in because it was at the front of the shop and it's just like, oh, this is so cute. What is this? They saw this high-rise white chair. I had this, you know, this little furry stuff on the station and they saw the makeup so then it was like, oh, there's something new. What's this? And we're like, oh, yeah, we're offering complimentary eye makeovers and they're like, eye makeover? What's that? Oh, let me show you. So then while they're maybe possibly getting ready to go under the dryer or you're done with their hair totally and you want to kind of give them this little look or whatever, that gave you an opportunity to present that retail to that client. You could do the same thing with the wigs. You can already have them set up in the salon, in a specific area to where when people are walking in, they're seeing these wigs and it's like, oh, y'all making wigs now? Yeah, girl, we making wigs. Takes one hour or less to make your wig. Matter of fact, you could walk in and get your wig off the street. We measure your hair. You come back in an hour. Your wig is done and ready. And that's just a tip for the people who's out there doing the sewing machine wigs. If you could just hire one person, you train them on how to do the sewing machine wig. If that's your technique that you're using and you can get people in and out in an hour getting a wig done, I don't know nobody else doing it. I might have just gave somebody a business idea. You get somebody, you raise them up. You might get you a student from the beauty college or beauty school or whoever, somebody in the shop that might be brand new and still building a clientele. Train them on whatever the technique that it is. That way, as the orders come in, you have somebody that can knock them out. And that technique is quick. It takes you 45 minutes to an hour to sew that wig together. Client now comes back. You put the wig on the client. You cut it. You style it on their head. They out the door. They out the door. And you add an additional fee to that particular service because you still got to shampoo them and braid them down, right? So now, I mean, this turns into not just wig retail itself, but now it has turned into also a service. So now you got a two for one bang. And because ain't nobody else out there really doing that, I mean, look at what can happen. This is what I'm saying. This is why I wanted to talk about this on the podcast because I need you wig makers to open your mind. I need you salon owners to open your mind. I need stylists to open your mind to the possibilities that are really endless with this thing, okay? Okay. And then tell people what makes your product different. So if you have a certain type of technique that you're using, I just gave away one, the sewing machine technique, right? Because that's what's hot right now. If your thing, whatever your thing is that makes your wigs different than everybody else, that's what you want to use to promote it because that's what's going to make your product different. But if you don't talk about it, people don't have a clue. They don't know. If your thing is, well, all of my wigs are glueless, meaning if you want to buy five wigs today, you could change your style every day this week if that's what you want to do. Catch, hey, that's what you want to let people know what you can do. You know what I'm saying? Everyone doesn't like the glue method. Everyone doesn't like the got to be glued and everyone doesn't like, you know, all these other glue products that are out there because honestly, a lot of people's skin is very sensitive. So they're allergic. I've also seen skin discoloration with the constant wearing of the glue, you know? And I've also seen to where, you know, people, they get it glued on, they start perspiring and sweating and they're like, dude, I don't have time to be taking this thing back down. I mean, I know you showed me, you sold me the product, but I'm just not good at it. It just doesn't look the same when you do it. So, hey, if that's your thing, then use that. Use that and show people, make a little commercial and show people, hey, these are some of the struggles that you can have by wearing a glued unit or a unit that has to be glued. And this is why, and these are the benefits and these are the features. Make yourself a commercial and put that on your TV screen. That way, when people are coming into the shop and sitting in your waiting area, that's what they're seeing because that's the new thing that you're retailing, okay? Or they're sitting back at the dryer and you have a, I always tell people, don't just have regular TV playing in the shop. Put some educational videos up there for your clients to see, especially if you're trying to promote something. So have you a little video reel going in, you know, people seeing this little commercial and they're like, you know what? I wanted to wear a lace wig, but I was nervous because I thought I was going to have to wear this glue and I have eczema or have super sensitive skin and I want to wear the look, but I just can't do it. You know what I'm saying? Like, we got to hit people in their home space. Like, what is personal to them? So with that, I mean, you can't go wrong with explaining the features and benefits of your wigs and what makes yours different, okay? So dare to be different. Talk about the bases that you use to make your wigs with. You know, you see, we see a lot of YouTubers using the same base. They're using what? That spandex cap or they're using a regular wig cap with the adjustable things in the back. You know, if you're using something different, show it. You're using something different than the non-professionals, show it. Let people see. No, these are the type of wig, ventilated wig caps that I use. And the reason why, because it allows your scalp to be breathable underneath. You know, that way your scalp won't hold on to so much bacteria from you perspiring. You know, my wig caps are breathable. These are the things that attract people to your product, but you have to be willing to share the information because if you don't, they just think that your wigs are like everybody else's. No, mine are different. You know, and this is why.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.24, "text": " But let me ask you a question.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [583, 718, 385, 1029, 291, 257, 1168, 13], "temperature": 0.0,

What are you doing in your salon as a wig maker? So if you're out here and you're making wigs, when people walk into your salon, they should see wigs everywhere. I mean, you should have doll heads on top of cabinets. I'm talking doll heads on top of display cases. I'm talking you should have wigs everywhere. And these wigs should have a price tag. Meaning if somebody just wants to come in your shop, they see a wig and they want to buy it right off the mannequin head, you should be able to sell it to them, whether they can fit it or not. That's an opportunity for you to have a wig station for them to try on the wig properly. And then you'll be able to offer an additional service by cutting that wig and customizing it to fit their face. And you're going to have those people that can fit it and maybe not fit it. So then that means you buy canvases to make your wigs in different sizes. So if you have one wig out on display and it's a red bob, you should have a couple of different sizes of red bob wigs in the back for retail. So there are many different ways that we can get into retailing wigs. We can also retail wigs that may be at a lower price point. These are things that we have to think about because the beauty supply stores are doing it and they're getting all of our money. So we got to bring this thing back. So I don't want you to look at yourself as a wig maker anymore. I want you to look at yourself as a wig retailer. And with that being said, who knows if you can get into your own wig retail business and you start selling wigs to other salon owners who are simply not interested in making wigs at all. You know what I mean? I mean, it's literally all about you forming relationships with other salon owners. And guess what? That can happen. So I just need us to think about the whole wig retail thing as a product. This is a product that you're producing, a product that you're selling, a product that people are going to tell somebody else where they got it from. And who knows? You might start getting people walking in the door and all they want to do is buy wigs. You may change a portion of your salon to where you separate it and have like a salon on this side and a wig retail business on this side. If that is what it is that you're doing, if you see that you're making good money at it, why not sit down and come up with a plan? And I'm going to talk about these P's. Come up with a plan that you can put forth that you can start making this residual income because that's what retailing is. You're bringing in residual income into your salon, getting you from behind the chair and not having to struggle and stress your body out to make money. I mean, it's really not that easy. It's difficult. So whether you be the stylist who makes the wigs, whether you be the stylist who buys wigs, whether you are the stylist who's making custom wigs, it don't matter. You need to be making sure that you are pushing your retail in your salon with your wigs all day, every day. There should not be a moment to where people are not seeing wigs. If you're all on Instagram saying that I sell wigs or I make wigs, let's just go ahead and make this a full-fledged wig retail business. Okay? And name your line. Name your wig line. You know what I mean? If you want to name it after your salon or whatever, come up with a name and do your thing. Like, just do you. So what, everybody out there selling wigs? There is something different that it is that you're doing that should make somebody else want to buy your product. So you got to figure out what that is. I don't know your niche. I don't know your thing. If it's cutting blunt cuts, if that's your thing, that's it. Focus on that. Come up with your own, like, style and your own niche that people know you for. If you're good at razor cuts, razor cut all your wigs. Show people that you're razor cutting your wigs. Do little demos in the salon. Have your area set up to where your clients are walking by and they're like, oh, she's making a wig. Like, let people see some of the process. Don't hide yourself away in the shop. Like, I used to do a little thing and I would just have this one station and it was just up for makeup, right? So that way we could introduce this makeup line at the time I was using. We could introduce the makeup line to the client so they could get their hair done and then we would offer, like, a free eyeshadow makeover. So now I set that area up and they would see it when they walked in because it was at the front of the shop and it's just like, oh, this is so cute. What is this? They saw this high-rise white chair. I had this, you know, this little furry stuff on the station and they saw the makeup so then it was like, oh, there's something new. What's this? And we're like, oh, yeah, we're offering complimentary eye makeovers and they're like, eye makeover? What's that? Oh, let me show you. So then while they're maybe possibly getting ready to go under the dryer or you're done with their hair totally and you want to kind of give them this little look or whatever, that gave you an opportunity to present that retail to that client. You could do the same thing with the wigs. You can already have them set up in the salon, in a specific area to where when people are walking in, they're seeing these wigs and it's like, oh, y'all making wigs now? Yeah, girl, we making wigs. Takes one hour or less to make your wig. Matter of fact, you could walk in and get your wig off the street. We measure your hair. You come back in an hour. Your wig is done and ready. And that's just a tip for the people who's out there doing the sewing machine wigs. If you could just hire one person, you train them on how to do the sewing machine wig. If that's your technique that you're using and you can get people in and out in an hour getting a wig done, I don't know nobody else doing it. I might have just gave somebody a business idea. You get somebody, you raise them up. You might get you a student from the beauty college or beauty school or whoever, somebody in the shop that might be brand new and still building a clientele. Train them on whatever the technique that it is. That way, as the orders come in, you have somebody that can knock them out. And that technique is quick. It takes you 45 minutes to an hour to sew that wig together. Client now comes back. You put the wig on the client. You cut it. You style it on their head. They out the door. They out the door. And you add an additional fee to that particular service because you still got to shampoo them and braid them down, right? So now, I mean, this turns into not just wig retail itself, but now it has turned into also a service. So now you got a two for one bang. And because ain't nobody else out there really doing that, I mean, look at what can happen. This is what I'm saying. This is why I wanted to talk about this on the podcast because I need you wig makers to open your mind. I need you salon owners to open your mind. I need stylists to open your mind to the possibilities that are really endless with this thing, okay? Okay. And then tell people what makes your product different. So if you have a certain type of technique that you're using, I just gave away one, the sewing machine technique, right? Because that's what's hot right now. If your thing, whatever your thing is that makes your wigs different than everybody else, that's what you want to use to promote it because that's what's going to make your product different. But if you don't talk about it, people don't have a clue. They don't know. If your thing is, well, all of my wigs are glueless, meaning if you want to buy five wigs today, you could change your style every day this week if that's what you want to do. Catch, hey, that's what you want to let people know what you can do. You know what I'm saying? Everyone doesn't like the glue method. Everyone doesn't like the got to be glued and everyone doesn't like, you know, all these other glue products that are out there because honestly, a lot of people's skin is very sensitive. So they're allergic. I've also seen skin discoloration with the constant wearing of the glue, you know? And I've also seen to where, you know, people, they get it glued on, they start perspiring and sweating and they're like, dude, I don't have time to be taking this thing back down. I mean, I know you showed me, you sold me the product, but I'm just not good at it. It just doesn't look the same when you do it. So, hey, if that's your thing, then use that. Use that and show people, make a little commercial and show people, hey, these are some of the struggles that you can have by wearing a glued unit or a unit that has to be glued. And this is why, and these are the benefits and these are the features. Make yourself a commercial and put that on your TV screen. That way, when people are coming into the shop and sitting in your waiting area, that's what they're seeing because that's the new thing that you're retailing, okay? Or they're sitting back at the dryer and you have a, I always tell people, don't just have regular TV playing in the shop. Put some educational videos up there for your clients to see, especially if you're trying to promote something. So have you a little video reel going in, you know, people seeing this little commercial and they're like, you know what? I wanted to wear a lace wig, but I was nervous because I thought I was going to have to wear this glue and I have eczema or have super sensitive skin and I want to wear the look, but I just can't do it. You know what I'm saying? Like, we got to hit people in their home space. Like, what is personal to them? So with that, I mean, you can't go wrong with explaining the features and benefits of your wigs and what makes yours different, okay? So dare to be different. Talk about the bases that you use to make your wigs with. You know, you see, we see a lot of YouTubers using the same base. They're using what? That spandex cap or they're using a regular wig cap with the adjustable things in the back. You know, if you're using something different, show it. You're using something different than the non-professionals, show it. Let people see. No, these are the type of wig, ventilated wig caps that I use. And the reason why, because it allows your scalp to be breathable underneath. You know, that way your scalp won't hold on to so much bacteria from you perspiring. You know, my wig caps are breathable. These are the things that attract people to your product, but you have to be willing to share the information because if you don't, they just think that your wigs are like everybody else's. No, mine are different.
