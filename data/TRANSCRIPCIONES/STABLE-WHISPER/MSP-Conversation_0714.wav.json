{"text": " Hello and welcome to Caps Lock and Cray, a podcast for serious criticism and serious feels. My name is Vera, aka Caps Lock, and with me today, as always, is Katie, aka Crays. Hello. Hello. Are you feeling the Olympic spirit? I guess so. Is the Olympic spirit upon you? Yes. Well, yeah, I feel like I'm already kind of like going to be obsessed with it, and I usually don't get like super crazy. Oh my God. I usually just watch like really popular stuff, but this time I feel like that's not the case. Good. I am absolutely an Olympic head. What would it be, an Olympophile? Yeah. So whenever the Olympics roll around, I'm just like, I'm there. You're immediately crazy. You immediately don't want to leave the couch. And it's become harder and harder because with each Olympics, there's more availability to the whole thing. Right. So this, for instance, Rio 2016, you have the NBC app, which you can like stream stuff. Which I believe existed two years ago. I think probably I wasn't using it, and certainly I was like online, you could obviously stream stuff. Yeah. But, you know, we are literally scrolling through it, and anything is there that's happening. So if you want to get like really like over your head, like deep end into the Olympics, I would definitely recommend downloading the NBC Sports app. But you have to deal with an ad that plays before you go crazy. I believe it probably is only available in America, I would imagine. Well, that's a bummer. But online? Because it's NBC, so it's like American Broadcast Network. Yeah. So, yeah, oh, I don't know. Well, it would be geo-locked. That's true. Online. Yeah. But anyway, if you're in America, you should download it. And then, yes, because you can live stream and then airplay. Yeah. Basically any ridiculous thing that you can think of that's going on that day, they are streaming it, and it's crazy. You want to see some canoe slaloms? You got it. You want to see dressage like I did this morning? All weekend. Abso-fucking-lutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's into dressage for summer. I love dressage. That's when the horsies dance. Yeah. So, it's good. They do little moves and stuff. Yeah, I should say what we're drinking this podcast. Oh. Because it's very sporty. Yeah, it's very sporty. We're going to have some water. Some H2O, guys. And I am drinking leftover Gatorade fruit plunge flavor. Fruit plunge? Fruit plunge flavor. Absolutely. From my stupid run this morning. Because I don't like doing athletic things, but I did do that this morning, so I could be in the Olympics. Yeah. Yeah. If you're in the equestrian, you can be super old and be still in the Olympics. I did not ride a horse. I just went for a run that was stupidly long. Yeah. I did not. But we are, if it's not clear, today we're talking about the Olympics. Yeah. Because the Olympics are upon us. Not our usual. We have not talked about sports before, I believe. We're going to seriously critique the Olympics. Yeah, no. We're just going to talk about them because we watch them. Yeah. And maybe you do too. It is a global event after all. So. Lots of people are usually interested. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Let me sip. Okay. Well, I guess we'll talk about this year and then we should talk about just, you know, our fave Olympics-y things. Sure. For this year and of Olympics past and what you're looking forward to. And Olympic-flavored movies. Ooh, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. I'll have to think of some. Okay. Yeah. Obviously this year is in Rio, leading up to it, a lot of interesting stuff. Yeah. But let's not talk about it. The opening ceremony was really great. Yeah. What did you think of the opening ceremony? I thought they were really good. Mm-hmm. And so, I mean, obviously I don't know like a super lot about it. I know they didn't, you know, it didn't cost as much as opening ceremonies of recent times. Mm-hmm. But I think it was China. What? Two years ago. No, Sochi was two years ago. And before that was? London. London. And then China was three, six years ago? China was 2008. So that's six years ago. Wow. What? What? I thought. Wow. I don't know. Oh my God. See, this is how bad I am at the Olympics. Yeah. Sochi was two years ago. London was 2012. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Vancouver. Oh no. Vancouver was 2010. Was 2010. Yeah. Yeah. How come I think that like, Shanghai or whatever, wherever it was. Where was it in China? Oh my God. Beijing? I don't know. Beijing. Was it Beijing? Why did I feel like that was like so recent? I don't know. It's really funny that you're kind of like into that one. Because you keep talking about it a lot. Okay. The reason that it came into my head and why I thought it was more recent, but it's like really clearly like a decade ago, was that it was like the most expensive, right? Oh. Up until Sochi? Like probably. I don't know all the budgets. I'm assuming that one was. It was like insane. I remember people were like, this is insane because we were like, gotta be the best. Of course. Obviously Sochi was like, gotta be the best. Yeah. Same thing. And so I don't know what the budgets were like comparatively, but like, I just remember that one being like, it was like mental in terms of like the amount of money. Yeah. Like, I don't remember it. That's the point. Yeah. Like, I don't remember. I don't really remember the Sochi one either. But I remember London because it was like really wacky. It was like the Danny Boyle stuff. Oh, you're talking about specifically only the opening ceremonies or the whole. I was talking about the opening ceremony. Okay. You don't remember the history of Russia as presented via Flying Child and, you know. Okay. It's coming back to me now. An intense part of it was about communism and it was like people rolling around and like, you know, cutting down like, what is it? The grass or whatever? Like with the, sickle and the. No, I don't remember. Threshing. I feel like I do remember the tiny floating person. Yeah. I was complaining about how every Olympics. London had that too. Yeah. Wasn't someone complaining about like, who was it on the tweets? Somebody was complaining, not me. Well, not complaining, but being like, this is great because it doesn't have like a kid. That's me. I said that to you. But then there was a kid. Oh, it was you. It was literally me on the couch next to you. I thought it was some really astute Twitterer. Oh, thanks for calling me astute. Yes, because literally my pet peeve about these things is always they have to have some kind of like child doing a narrative of like hope and like the future. So some random child is hired to go around being like, what's that? What's this? And if it has more budget, the child flies, which has happened like two times before, at least, if not more. And this time there was a really cute child doing the samba. He wasn't flying. He wasn't part of like a crazy narrative. It was really like, well, there was the one later that walked by, but it was two seconds. The samba kid was my favorite. He was amazing. My point a hundred years ago before I like realized that I don't know how to do time is that the Rio opening ceremony had like a not as much money. And I think they did more with it than these like really bombastic ones that I don't remember. And I thought it was really beautiful. They do obviously a lot nowadays. Then maybe it's unfair. I don't know. In like days of like way yore because the freaking like the projection shit is insane. And like as long as you have that crazy projection shit and you like know how to use it, it's going to look cool on TV. Yeah. I was just thinking about like the old, you know, the ones from before the projection started, not like super long ago, but, you know, in our time. And how, how did like, how did they do their stuff? They had probably had a lot of like, you know, dancers and like weird puppetry and stuff to be representative. Some Julie Taymor shit or something. Oh my gosh. Can you imagine? That'd be amazing. I don't know. I'm just reminded, my favorite Olympics were the Athens ones because I love Greece. Of course. And I was like, I remember them being, they were so sad they lost the 2000 games because they really wanted it in 2000. But like it was so pretty in Australia. I know, but they wanted it on that like round number. I mean, it's nice. And they wanted it to be, you know, their, their games they lost. Maybe it's better. I don't remember Athens at all. You were talking about it. Oh my God. In Athens, they wore, whenever they won the medals, they put on the little like leaves on their heads. Okay. You know, cause, cause Greece, the olive wreath. Yeah. No, I know what you mean. And it was amazing. And in their opening ceremonies, of course, cause each country kind of has to introduce their country to the world. So they always do some kind of like crazy historical visualization of their country. So that of course they had, you know, ancient Greece represented, which is the, obviously the birth place of the Olympics. And it was extra special because they were in Greece. Yeah. I loved it. Okay. Anyway. So what, how did you feel about, about I did, I really loved the simplicity of it. I didn't quite love the length in terms of like, I felt like it, every, there was a point where it seemed that the ceremony is like climaxed. And then there was like another, you know, another thing. And I was like, Oh, I'm ready for this parade of nations, which is technically speaking, that's my favorite part.", "segments": [{"start": 0.08, "end": 1.82, "text": " Hello and welcome to Caps Lock

criticism and serious feels. My name is Vera, aka Caps Lock, and with me today, as always, is Katie, aka Crays. Hello. Hello. Are you feeling the Olympic spirit? I guess so. Is the Olympic spirit upon you? Yes. Well, yeah, I feel like I'm already kind of like going to be obsessed with it, and I usually don't get like super crazy. Oh my God. I usually just watch like really popular stuff, but this time I feel like that's not the case. Good. I am absolutely an Olympic head. What would it be, an Olympophile? Yeah. So whenever the Olympics roll around, I'm just like, I'm there. You're immediately crazy. You immediately don't want to leave the couch. And it's become harder and harder because with each Olympics, there's more availability to the whole thing. Right. So this, for instance, Rio 2016, you have the NBC app, which you can like stream stuff. Which I believe existed two years ago. I think probably I wasn't using it, and certainly I was like online, you could obviously stream stuff. Yeah. But, you know, we are literally scrolling through it, and anything is there that's happening. So if you want to get like really like over your head, like deep end into the Olympics, I would definitely recommend downloading the NBC Sports app. But you have to deal with an ad that plays before you go crazy. I believe it probably is only available in America, I would imagine. Well, that's a bummer. But online? Because it's NBC, so it's like American Broadcast Network. Yeah. So, yeah, oh, I don't know. Well, it would be geo-locked. That's true. Online. Yeah. But anyway, if you're in America, you should download it. And then, yes, because you can live stream and then airplay. Yeah. Basically any ridiculous thing that you can think of that's going on that day, they are streaming it, and it's crazy. You want to see some canoe slaloms? You got it. You want to see dressage like I did this morning? All weekend. Abso-fucking-lutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's into dressage for summer. I love dressage. That's when the horsies dance. Yeah. So, it's good. They do little moves and stuff. Yeah, I should say what we're drinking this podcast. Oh. Because it's very sporty. Yeah, it's very sporty. We're going to have some water. Some H2O, guys. And I am drinking leftover Gatorade fruit plunge flavor. Fruit plunge? Fruit plunge flavor. Absolutely. From my stupid run this morning. Because I don't like doing athletic things, but I did do that this morning, so I could be in the Olympics. Yeah. Yeah. If you're in the equestrian, you can be super old and be still in the Olympics. I did not ride a horse. I just went for a run that was stupidly long. Yeah. I did not. But we are, if it's not clear, today we're talking about the Olympics. Yeah. Because the Olympics are upon us. Not our usual. We have not talked about sports before, I believe. We're going to seriously critique the Olympics. Yeah, no. We're just going to talk about them because we watch them. Yeah. And maybe you do too. It is a global event after all. So. Lots of people are usually interested. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Let me sip. Okay. Well, I guess we'll talk about this year and then we should talk about just, you know, our fave Olympics-y things. Sure. For this year and of Olympics past and what you're looking forward to. And Olympic-flavored movies. Ooh, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. I'll have to think of some. Okay. Yeah. Obviously this year is in Rio, leading up to it, a lot of interesting stuff. Yeah. But let's not talk about it. The opening ceremony was really great. Yeah. What did you think of the opening ceremony? I thought they were really good. Mm-hmm. And so, I mean, obviously I don't know like a super lot about it. I know they didn't, you know, it didn't cost as much as opening ceremonies of recent times. Mm-hmm. But I think it was China. What? Two years ago. No, Sochi was two years ago. And before that was? London. London. And then China was three, six years ago? China was 2008. So that's six years ago. Wow. What? What? I thought. Wow. I don't know. Oh my God. See, this is how bad I am at the Olympics. Yeah. Sochi was two years ago. London was 2012. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Vancouver. Oh no. Vancouver was 2010. Was 2010. Yeah. Yeah. How come I think that like, Shanghai or whatever, wherever it was. Where was it in China? Oh my God. Beijing? I don't know. Beijing. Was it Beijing? Why did I feel like that was like so recent? I don't know. It's really funny that you're kind of like into that one. Because you keep talking about it a lot. Okay. The reason that it came into my head and why I thought it was more recent, but it's like really clearly like a decade ago, was that it was like the most expensive, right? Oh. Up until Sochi? Like probably. I don't know all the budgets. I'm assuming that one was. It was like insane. I remember people were like, this is insane because we were like, gotta be the best. Of course. Obviously Sochi was like, gotta be the best. Yeah. Same thing. And so I don't know what the budgets were like comparatively, but like, I just remember that one being like, it was like mental in terms of like the amount of money. Yeah. Like, I don't remember it. That's the point. Yeah. Like, I don't remember. I don't really remember the Sochi one either. But I remember London because it was like really wacky. It was like the Danny Boyle stuff. Oh, you're talking about specifically only the opening ceremonies or the whole. I was talking about the opening ceremony. Okay. You don't remember the history of Russia as presented via Flying Child and, you know. Okay. It's coming back to me now. An intense part of it was about communism and it was like people rolling around and like, you know, cutting down like, what is it? The grass or whatever? Like with the, sickle and the. No, I don't remember. Threshing. I feel like I do remember the tiny floating person. Yeah. I was complaining about how every Olympics. London had that too. Yeah. Wasn't someone complaining about like, who was it on the tweets? Somebody was complaining, not me. Well, not complaining, but being like, this is great because it doesn't have like a kid. That's me. I said that to you. But then there was a kid. Oh, it was you. It was literally me on the couch next to you. I thought it was some really astute Twitterer. Oh, thanks for calling me astute. Yes, because literally my pet peeve about these things is always they have to have some kind of like child doing a narrative of like hope and like the future. So some random child is hired to go around being like, what's that? What's this? And if it has more budget, the child flies, which has happened like two times before, at least, if not more. And this time there was a really cute child doing the samba. He wasn't flying. He wasn't part of like a crazy narrative. It was really like, well, there was the one later that walked by, but it was two seconds. The samba kid was my favorite. He was amazing. My point a hundred years ago before I like realized that I don't know how to do time is that the Rio opening ceremony had like a not as much money. And I think they did more with it than these like really bombastic ones that I don't remember. And I thought it was really beautiful. They do obviously a lot nowadays. Then maybe it's unfair. I don't know. In like days of like way yore because the freaking like the projection shit is insane. And like as long as you have that crazy projection shit and you like know how to use it, it's going to look cool on TV. Yeah. I was just thinking about like the old, you know, the ones from before the projection started, not like super long ago, but, you know, in our time. And how, how did like, how did they do their stuff? They had probably had a lot of like, you know, dancers and like weird puppetry and stuff to be representative. Some Julie Taymor shit or something. Oh my gosh. Can you imagine? That'd be amazing. I don't know. I'm just reminded, my favorite Olympics were the Athens ones because I love Greece. Of course. And I was like, I remember them being, they were so sad they lost the 2000 games because they really wanted it in 2000. But like it was so pretty in Australia. I know, but they wanted it on that like round number. I mean, it's nice. And they wanted it to be, you know, their, their games they lost. Maybe it's better. I don't remember Athens at all. You were talking about it. Oh my God. In Athens, they wore, whenever they won the medals, they put on the little like leaves on their heads. Okay. You know, cause, cause Greece, the olive wreath. Yeah. No, I know what you mean. And it was amazing. And in their opening ceremonies, of course, cause each country kind of has to introduce their country to the world. So they always do some kind of like crazy historical visualization of their country. So that of course they had, you know, ancient Greece represented, which is the, obviously the birth place of the Olympics. And it was extra special because they were in Greece. Yeah. I loved it. Okay. Anyway. So what, how did you feel about, about I did, I really loved the simplicity of it. I didn't quite love the length in terms of like, I felt like it, every, there was a point where it seemed that the ceremony is like climaxed. And then there was like another, you know, another thing. And I was like, Oh, I'm ready for this parade of nations, which is technically speaking, that's my favorite part.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.08, "end": 5.0, "text": " Hello and welcome to
