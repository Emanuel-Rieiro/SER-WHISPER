{"text": " Okay. Like there is no, there is no inappropriate touching that's included in a massage. They're not supposed to touch you in areas that are covered by a bathing suit. If you're wondering what that is. Right. And, and massage therapists don't, um, I, I get massages and I've never had a massage therapist, uh, touch me anywhere that I didn't want to be touched, which I'm very grateful for. Um, but unfortunately there's been some women coming forward and saying that actually more than 180 women have reported being sexually assaulted at a chain of massage, uh, at a spa chain called massage envy. Now I don't mean to, you know, just bring up these allegations against massage envy. I'm sure that this is a large chain and they've got a lot of locations. It's a billion dollar company. Um, they just have numbers. And so this is happening. And they also apparently have a corporate policy that isn't really designed to protect the clients. It's more to protect the company, you know, as we'll see, as we get into this article, but I'm sure, but, but like sexual assault happens with massage therapists all over the place. It's not just at chains. It's, it can happen to anyone basically. And, you know, it's really important if you're willing, if you're feel comfortable, um, to say something about it, because otherwise it may continue going on. And who knows how many clients, uh, a massage therapist could have, they could be touching all of those clients and everybody is thinking to themselves, Oh my God, well, did I, did I actually imagine this? I'm second guessing myself. Is anyone going to believe me if I talk about it? Well, if it happened to you, odds are you're not the only one that happened to. So, you know, I, I hope, I hope at this time in 2017, um, people are going to be more empowered and more likely to come forward if they do experience something like this and more likely to be believed. That's something that I think a lot of people have known for a really long time. Especially women that if it's happened to you, it's happened to other people. That's right. And now it's like, finally, like you said, reaching a critical mass to where it's being accepted as truth and reality, even though it's always been reality. Um, it's being more broadly accepted and that's a really good thing because yeah, if, if it has happened to you, it's happened to other people. This is the way abuse works. Abuse in sexual harassment, sexual assault is a systemic problem and abusers are able to get away with it because it's such a humiliating, intimidating thing to have happen. Yes. They count on the victims being silent. Yes. Yes. And it's a lot easier to be silent when you've experienced certain types of, I mean, to be sexually abused is one of the most disempowering things you can go through and you don't want to talk about it to people. You don't, maybe you don't want people to feel bad for you or you don't want to think of yourself as a victim. Or you're just too ashamed. Um, or you think you were the only one or something like that. I mean, even though I would say a lot more women, no, that's not the case. I think there's still a significant portion who don't know that that's a general rule when it comes to sexual abuse. Right. And the massage thing, that's, that's one of my scariest, um, your worst fears, one of my worst fears. And I didn't get a massage for so long. Cause I'm very, um, weird about strangers touching me because of my history with, with, uh, you know, being sexually abused and stuff. Like I didn't get a massage for, until I was, until after I got divorced, even, I mean, I didn't get a massage until I turned, I think I was like after 25. Um, and I only went to a friend that I had known for almost a decade at that point to give me a massage. And she was a female and, you know, I trusted her completely. And I've been weird. I've still, I'm still even kind of nervous about massages now. Um, you know, of course, most massage therapists are professionals and they're not going to engage in that kind of behavior, but you read stuff like this and it's kind of terrifying. It's you're in such, you're in one of the most vulnerable positions when you're getting a massage. You're mostly nude. You're in the, in private quarters with a stranger and it's very, you can't exactly just get up. And walk away because you're undressed. Right, right. It causes a whole thing that you have to go, you have to process. And when, when something like that is happening to you, you're not going to have an immediate reaction because you're in shock. And this is what something people don't realize when, when they say, oh, well, why didn't such and such come out about this sooner? Or why didn't they tell the person to stop? Why didn't they say something at the time or do something when it's happening? You're in such a state of shock and you're in a totally different mind frame and you have a delayed reaction to it. Sometimes you don't even get angry about what happened to you until weeks or months later. You may not even recognize it as abuse. And that's also what we're seeing with the Me Too phenomenon. You're seeing a bunch of people coming out and having to relive that and realizing that some of the things that have happened to them were not okay. We're not, we're extremely damaging and they're having to, you know, kind of reconcile that with how they're moving forward in their lives. Yeah, absolutely. I'm glad you said that because like, yeah, if anybody's listening to this, sexual harassment is extremely common. I don't know anyone who hasn't been. I don't know anyone who hasn't either, you know, of any gender, really. It happens to everyone. Yeah. And so if you think you've never been sexually harassed, let's just start there with harassment. That's sort of like the lowest bar, I guess. If you think you've never been sexually harassed, you might want to think again, because you probably have. And there are just things, you know, you just haven't understood it as such to be harassment. Right, right. It's such a broad category. And it is different than other types of sexual abuse. But that doesn't mean that it's not a problem. It's even more prevalent because it's not always as outwardly violent. Yeah, it can be extremely subtle. If you look at some of these cases, we're finding out about someone like Al Franken, who's real handsy with people and real like subtly gropey. And that's much more common than, for example, Harvey Weinstein, drugging people and raping people and setting up spy networks on them. You know, one is maybe seen as more insidious and malicious than the other one. But sexual harassment is on a spectrum like so many other things. It's still a problem, you know. It's not good to like downplay. I read this terrible article about, oh, God, it got me so upset about how Al Franken's victim wasn't a victim. Because, you know, this the person writing it was like, I've been raped, and I've had worse things happen to me. And that's the complete wrongheaded approach when it comes to this topic. Yeah, it's not a one upmanship, like my trauma is worse than your trauma. It's okay, we all have trauma, you know, to some extent in some areas. And we have to recognize everybody's traumas as such as traumas. Yeah, like I think you said, when you shared that online that like, if you drown in seven feet of water, and somebody else drowns in 14 feet of water, you both drowned, right? It's both like bad things, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I'm glad that we're seeing a larger degree of empathy for people who've gone through things like this. And we're seeing so much of this violence exposed, because let's call it what it is. You know, it is a form of violence. It is a way to exploit power dynamics in a situation. And a lot of times, these people think that nothing was going to come of it. And so far, it hasn't. I mean, oh, yeah, because until like now, kind of, it's almost like I was gonna say before, it's almost like an art, how the way that abusers manipulate people into gaslighting themselves, gaslighting is like, you know, when you kind of make someone think they're going crazy, right? Like, people who are victims of abuse and harassment often think that, like, they talk themselves out of thinking that something bad was done to them. They don't think they think, well, did I actually imagine that? Did that really happen? If I talk about this? Is anyone going to believe me? You know, am I going to get in trouble? Is this going to be blamed on me? Like, all those thoughts go through somebody's head. And the abusers have ways of like, subtly instilling those thoughts, or at least invoking them, that, like invoking the thoughts that people absorb from just general culture and society, like, society and culture teach you how to gaslight yourself almost into thinking that you weren't actually victimized, or even if you were, no one's going to care. And so you shouldn't talk about it. And you should be ashamed and embarrassed. You know, and that's what abusers count on. And that's how they get away with it. So realizing that realizing that there's actually like a concrete mechanism for this that you can describe, that is that that shows how abusers silence their victims, and how victims get, get silenced, and how they can abusers continue to get away with it. Understanding that it breaks, it breaks its spell over you, you know, it breaks its power over you so that you can actually snap out of it and understand what happened to you as something traumatic. And then if you're up for it, if you're comfortable, you can talk about it. And you can bring that abuser down. And now we're seeing that happen. And I'm glad. So anyway, you know, just introduce this topic from the, the massage envy thing. But that was kind of what the discussion that I wanted to get into. Yeah, yeah. And again, I'm glad that it's happening. I want all the predators to be outed. I don't care how likable they are. I don't care how wonderful they are. I don't care what good things they've done. No amount of good things that someone does for other people outweighs how they've abused other people in different situations, because you do treat people differently. In a lot of cases, I've heard so many cases of abuse. For example, something like domestic violence, that's so insidious, and it's such a huge problem. And one of the most common things you hear is, you're in situations like that as well. It's none of my business. It's just between those two people. And well, let's just say it's a guy, the guy's never done anything bad to me. He's never hurt me. And it's like he wouldn't have, though. Right. Especially when it comes to how men treat each other versus how they treat women. Oh, yes, a man can be perfectly nice to other men, because he recognizes that they're on an even power playing field. That's right. They're not going to not exploit that power differential of people. And that's such the biggest takeaway from all this is recognizing what power does to people, even in small ways, even in what we would think of as kind of subtle ways. And people really need to take this in, take this as a lesson, because it's not an excuse for abuse. And you're enabling abuse if you're one of those people who's saying, well, such and such was nice to me, you know, or the whole, there's two sides to every story bullshit, which, yeah, there are two sides to every story, but one side's usually closer to the truth. And when it comes to that situation, you have to observe power dynamics, and you have to observe who's more likely to be exploited. Yeah, I agree. And it's, should we treat everyone, you know, the same and as we want to be treated and stuff like that? Yeah, sure, ideally. But that's not what reality works like. And if you function in, you know, operating off of fantasy principles in reality land, bad things can happen to you. And you also, not you personally, but that's why society hasn't progressed in a lot of ways. Yeah. As people have their idea of what things should be and a limited perspective on how people can be. And we're finding out some of our most favorite artists and actors and stuff like that are not great. People, I wrote a whole article for this on Medium, too, basically about how we deal with the art and the artists. And it's called The Art We Lost. And it focuses on, yes, there are all these great artists throughout history that have created these wonderful, beautiful things that were kind of shitty people that abused people that permanently harmed people. And what about the artists and other creative types that they abused? We're forever missing out. On the art that they could have made. Yeah, that the victims could have made, but that they couldn't make because they were so traumatized, right? Yeah. Yeah, everybody, everybody, that's like the seen and the unseen, right? It's, that's what, yeah, that's the analogy I always use with this of the seen and the unseen. I mean, I've lost years of creative output to trauma. Yeah. Because of bullshit abuse that I've had to go through. And it's frustrating. And it makes me extremely angry to think about that the people who were in those positions of power and that abused me did not lose out in that same kind of way. Or they're still seen as revered in certain circles. They're still seen as good people. Or it was diminished because it was like, well, that's just between you two. That's just a relationship thing. Something we've also found is that people who kill their spouses or their partners get lighter prison sentences than strangers who kill other strangers on the street. And this is specific to women. That is really disturbing. Yeah. It is really disturbing. And it's a reflection of these kinds of social problems. The two sides-ism, right? Like the making excuses. Yeah. I know we see it in all kinds of circumstances. Like sometimes people are just so quick to be an apologist for somebody who has victimized someone else. If that person is liked, if that person is popular or socially powerful, right? Where, you know, we see it over and over like the Steubenville, Ohio rape case where they were lamenting the end of the football careers of the rapists or Brock Turner, the end of his swimming career. And his father wrote this letter to the judge where he said, oh, a 30 minute mistake shouldn't cost him a whole career, right? What about his career? We always hear that. And really, what about the, what about everything that was taken away from the victim, you know, that we may never see because they're so traumatized that they have to spend all this time healing from their trauma and can't create or do anything. Well, not that they can't necessarily do anything productive, but there is a cost to having to heal from all that trauma, having to spend time and resources healing from trauma instead of doing other things. People who are most likely to be victimized don't always even have access to those resources. Yeah, that's right. The most disadvantaged people in society. I mean, those people are the easiest to abuse and they have the least amount of resources to help recover from that abuse. You know, they're not going to be able to go to an EMDR therapist and get that type of treatment or go to a CBT therapist or, you know, get on some medication to help them deal with the, the nightmares and stuff they might be suffering or other PTSD symptoms. Like it's not always a matter of, well, you know, bad stuff happens, but at least, you know, people can get help and heal from it. Like that's a very limited perspective of who can actually get help and heal from it. Yeah, it's tricky. It's really tricky to heal sometimes and it's expensive to heal. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. And by the way, just for anybody who's listening and doesn't know what EMDR therapy is, or CBD therapy, CBT, excuse me, it's confusing. Where's your mind at? CBD oil, right? EMDR is a modality of therapy that is supposed to help with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. EMDR stands for like eye movement directed response or something like that. And it's, it basically is the, the basic idea as I understand it is kind of slowly reintroducing people to things that might be triggering to their PTSD while having them do a series of eye movements that are supposed to be like kind of just distracting enough to keep the person from dissociating and, and get them to be able to integrate that therapeutic re-exposure to the things that trigger them. And rebuilding different pathways in the brain, because we're finding out the way the brain deals with trauma is creating these pathways. And the more you think of that trauma, you're making a stronger kind of pathway. You're making a direct link. Taking that rut deeper. Right, right. And it gets harder to heal. And I've experienced this personally as someone who, you know, has gone through PTSD symptoms. It's, it's infuriating. And like the brain is so complex, but it's just, it can be infuriating and terrifying to not have any control over what your brain is thinking about and just reliving these kinds of traumatic things. Yeah. It can drive you crazy. Yeah. And it's very difficult to learn how to stop that without actual therapy, you know, and I've done a limited amount of therapy. I've done cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a different approach. The therapy that was mentioned before, cognitive behavioral therapy is the idea that there are thoughts that cause feelings. There are thoughts that underlie feelings. And so if we can question those thoughts and whether they're actually true, we can sometimes talk ourself out of feelings that are unwanted or negative. Yeah. And I've had some, some success with that, but it is very difficult when you get into a kind of depression, anxiety cycle to snap out of it. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Really, really hard. I haven't heard anybody say that in a while to someone who's depressed. Like, well, I'll just snap out of it. Cause I think now people are maybe recognizing a little more that you really can't just snap out of it.

Like there is no, there is no inappropriate touching that's included in a massage. They're not supposed to touch you in areas that are covered by a bathing suit. If you're wondering what that is. Right. And, and massage therapists don't, um, I, I get massages and I've never had a massage therapist, uh, touch me anywhere that I didn't want to be touched, which I'm very grateful for. Um, but unfortunately there's been some women coming forward and saying that actually more than 180 women have reported being sexually assaulted at a chain of massage, uh, at a spa chain called massage envy. Now I don't mean to, you know, just bring up these allegations against massage envy. I'm sure that this is a large chain and they've got a lot of locations. It's a billion dollar company. Um, they just have numbers. And so this is happening. And they also apparently have a corporate policy that isn't really designed to protect the clients. It's more to protect the company, you know, as we'll see, as we get into this article, but I'm sure, but, but like sexual assault happens with massage therapists all over the place. It's not just at chains. It's, it can happen to anyone basically. And, you know, it's really important if you're willing, if you're feel comfortable, um, to say something about it, because otherwise it may continue going on. And who knows how many clients, uh, a massage therapist could have, they could be touching all of those clients and everybody is thinking to themselves, Oh my God, well, did I, did I actually imagine this? I'm second guessing myself. Is anyone going to believe me if I talk about it? Well, if it happened to you, odds are you're not the only one that happened to. So, you know, I, I hope, I hope at this time in 2017, um, people are going to be more empowered and more likely to come forward if they do experience something like this and more likely to be believed. That's something that I think a lot of people have known for a really long time. Especially women that if it's happened to you, it's happened to other people. That's right. And now it's like, finally, like you said, reaching a critical mass to where it's being accepted as truth and reality, even though it's always been reality. Um, it's being more broadly accepted and that's a really good thing because yeah, if, if it has happened to you, it's happened to other people. This is the way abuse works. Abuse in sexual harassment, sexual assault is a systemic problem and abusers are able to get away with it because it's such a humiliating, intimidating thing to have happen. Yes. They count on the victims being silent. Yes. Yes. And it's a lot easier to be silent when you've experienced certain types of, I mean, to be sexually abused is one of the most disempowering things you can go through and you don't want to talk about it to people. You don't, maybe you don't want people to feel bad for you or you don't want to think of yourself as a victim. Or you're just too ashamed. Um, or you think you were the only one or something like that. I mean, even though I would say a lot more women, no, that's not the case. I think there's still a significant portion who don't know that that's a general rule when it comes to sexual abuse. Right. And the massage thing, that's, that's one of my scariest, um, your worst fears, one of my worst fears. And I didn't get a massage for so long. Cause I'm very, um, weird about strangers touching me because of my history with, with, uh, you know, being sexually abused and stuff. Like I didn't get a massage for, until I was, until after I got divorced, even, I mean, I didn't get a massage until I turned, I think I was like after 25. Um, and I only went to a friend that I had known for almost a decade at that point to give me a massage. And she was a female and, you know, I trusted her completely. And I've been weird. I've still, I'm still even kind of nervous about massages now. Um, you know, of course, most massage therapists are professionals and they're not going to engage in that kind of behavior, but you read stuff like this and it's kind of terrifying. It's you're in such, you're in one of the most vulnerable positions when you're getting a massage. You're mostly nude. You're in the, in private quarters with a stranger and it's very, you can't exactly just get up. And walk away because you're undressed. Right, right. It causes a whole thing that you have to go, you have to process. And when, when something like that is happening to you, you're not going to have an immediate reaction because you're in shock. And this is what something people don't realize when, when they say, oh, well, why didn't such and such come out about this sooner? Or why didn't they tell the person to stop? Why didn't they say something at the time or do something when it's happening? You're in such a state of shock and you're in a totally different mind frame and you have a delayed reaction to it. Sometimes you don't even get angry about what happened to you until weeks or months later. You may not even recognize it as abuse. And that's also what we're seeing with the Me Too phenomenon. You're seeing a bunch of people coming out and having to relive that and realizing that some of the things that have happened to them were not okay. We're not, we're extremely damaging and they're having to, you know, kind of reconcile that with how they're moving forward in their lives. Yeah, absolutely. I'm glad you said that because like, yeah, if anybody's listening to this, sexual harassment is extremely common. I don't know anyone who hasn't been. I don't know anyone who hasn't either, you know, of any gender, really. It happens to everyone. Yeah. And so if you think you've never been sexually harassed, let's just start there with harassment. That's sort of like the lowest bar, I guess. If you think you've never been sexually harassed, you might want to think again, because you probably have. And there are just things, you know, you just haven't understood it as such to be harassment. Right, right. It's such a broad category. And it is different than other types of sexual abuse. But that doesn't mean that it's not a problem. It's even more prevalent because it's not always as outwardly violent. Yeah, it can be extremely subtle. If you look at some of these cases, we're finding out about someone like Al Franken, who's real handsy with people and real like subtly gropey. And that's much more common than, for example, Harvey Weinstein, drugging people and raping people and setting up spy networks on them. You know, one is maybe seen as more insidious and malicious than the other one. But sexual harassment is on a spectrum like so many other things. It's still a problem, you know. It's not good to like downplay. I read this terrible article about, oh, God, it got me so upset about how Al Franken's victim wasn't a victim. Because, you know, this the person writing it was like, I've been raped, and I've had worse things happen to me. And that's the complete wrongheaded approach when it comes to this topic. Yeah, it's not a one upmanship, like my trauma is worse than your trauma. It's okay, we all have trauma, you know, to some extent in some areas. And we have to recognize everybody's traumas as such as traumas. Yeah, like I think you said, when you shared that online that like, if you drown in seven feet of water, and somebody else drowns in 14 feet of water, you both drowned, right? It's both like bad things, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I'm glad that we're seeing a larger degree of empathy for people who've gone through things like this. And we're seeing so much of this violence exposed, because let's call it what it is. You know, it is a form of violence. It is a way to exploit power dynamics in a situation. And a lot of times, these people think that nothing was going to come of it. And so far, it hasn't. I mean, oh, yeah, because until like now, kind of, it's almost like I was gonna say before, it's almost like an art, how the way that abusers manipulate people into gaslighting themselves, gaslighting is like, you know, when you kind of make someone think they're going crazy, right? Like, people who are victims of abuse and harassment often think that, like, they talk themselves out of thinking that something bad was done to them. They don't think they think, well, did I actually imagine that? Did that really happen? If I talk about this? Is anyone going to believe me? You know, am I going to get in trouble? Is this going to be blamed on me? Like, all those thoughts go through somebody's head. And the abusers have ways of like, subtly instilling those thoughts, or at least invoking them, that, like invoking the thoughts that people absorb from just general culture and society, like, society and culture teach you how to gaslight yourself almost into thinking that you weren't actually victimized, or even if you were, no one's going to care. And so you shouldn't talk about it. And you should be ashamed and embarrassed. You know, and that's what abusers count on. And that's how they get away with it. So realizing that realizing that there's actually like a concrete mechanism for this that you can describe, that is that that shows how abusers silence their victims, and how victims get, get silenced, and how they can abusers continue to get away with it. Understanding that it breaks, it breaks its spell over you, you know, it breaks its power over you so that you can actually snap out of it and understand what happened to you as something traumatic. And then if you're up for it, if you're comfortable, you can talk about it. And you can bring that abuser down. And now we're seeing that happen. And I'm glad. So anyway, you know, just introduce this topic from the, the massage envy thing. But that was kind of what the discussion that I wanted to get into. Yeah, yeah. And again, I'm glad that it's happening. I want all the predators to be outed. I don't care how likable they are. I don't care how wonderful they are. I don't care what good things they've done. No amount of good things that someone does for other people outweighs how they've abused other people in different situations, because you do treat people differently. In a lot of cases, I've heard so many cases of abuse. For example, something like domestic violence, that's so insidious, and it's such a huge problem. And one of the most common things you hear is, you're in situations like that as well. It's none of my business. It's just between those two people. And well, let's just say it's a guy, the guy's never done anything bad to me. He's never hurt me. And it's like he wouldn't have, though. Right. Especially when it comes to how men treat each other versus how they treat women. Oh, yes, a man can be perfectly nice to other men, because he recognizes that they're on an even power playing field. That's right. They're not going to not exploit that power differential of people. And that's such the biggest takeaway from all this is recognizing what power does to people, even in small ways, even in what we would think of as kind of subtle ways. And people really need to take this in, take this as a lesson, because it's not an excuse for abuse. And you're enabling abuse if you're one of those people who's saying, well, such and such was nice to me, you know, or the whole, there's two sides to every story bullshit, which, yeah, there are two sides to every story, but one side's usually closer to the truth. And when it comes to that situation, you have to observe power dynamics, and you have to observe who's more likely to be exploited. Yeah, I agree. And it's, should we treat everyone, you know, the same and as we want to be treated and stuff like that? Yeah, sure, ideally. But that's not what reality works like. And if you function in, you know, operating off of fantasy principles in reality land, bad things can happen to you. And you also, not you personally, but that's why society hasn't progressed in a lot of ways. Yeah. As people have their idea of what things should be and a limited perspective on how people can be. And we're finding out some of our most favorite artists and actors and stuff like that are not great. People, I wrote a whole article for this on Medium, too, basically about how we deal with the art and the artists. And it's called The Art We Lost. And it focuses on, yes, there are all these great artists throughout history that have created these wonderful, beautiful things that were kind of shitty people that abused people that permanently harmed people. And what about the artists and other creative types that they abused? We're forever missing out. On the art that they could have made. Yeah, that the victims could have made, but that they couldn't make because they were so traumatized, right? Yeah. Yeah, everybody, everybody, that's like the seen and the unseen, right? It's, that's what, yeah, that's the analogy I always use with this of the seen and the unseen. I mean, I've lost years of creative output to trauma. Yeah. Because of bullshit abuse that I've had to go through. And it's frustrating. And it makes me extremely angry to think about that the people who were in those positions of power and that abused me did not lose out in that same kind of way. Or they're still seen as revered in certain circles. They're still seen as good people. Or it was diminished because it was like, well, that's just between you two. That's just a relationship thing. Something we've also found is that people who kill their spouses or their partners get lighter prison sentences than strangers who kill other strangers on the street. And this is specific to women. That is really disturbing. Yeah. It is really disturbing. And it's a reflection of these kinds of social problems. The two sides-ism, right? Like the making excuses. Yeah. I know we see it in all kinds of circumstances. Like sometimes people are just so quick to be an apologist for somebody who has victimized someone else. If that person is liked, if that person is popular or socially powerful, right? Where, you know, we see it over and over like the Steubenville, Ohio rape case where they were lamenting the end of the football careers of the rapists or Brock Turner, the end of his swimming career. And his father wrote this letter to the judge where he said, oh, a 30 minute mistake shouldn't cost him a whole career, right? What about his career? We always hear that. And really, what about the, what about everything that was taken away from the victim, you know, that we may never see because they're so traumatized that they have to spend all this time healing from their trauma and can't create or do anything. Well, not that they can't necessarily do anything productive, but there is a cost to having to heal from all that trauma, having to spend time and resources healing from trauma instead of doing other things. People who are most likely to be victimized don't always even have access to those resources. Yeah, that's right. The most disadvantaged people in society. I mean, those people are the easiest to abuse and they have the least amount of resources to help recover from that abuse. You know, they're not going to be able to go to an EMDR therapist and get that type of treatment or go to a CBT therapist or, you know, get on some medication to help them deal with the, the nightmares and stuff they might be suffering or other PTSD symptoms. Like it's not always a matter of, well, you know, bad stuff happens, but at least, you know, people can get help and heal from it. Like that's a very limited perspective of who can actually get help and heal from it. Yeah, it's tricky. It's really tricky to heal sometimes and it's expensive to heal. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. And by the way, just for anybody who's listening and doesn't know what EMDR therapy is, or CBD therapy, CBT, excuse me, it's confusing. Where's your mind at? CBD oil, right? EMDR is a modality of therapy that is supposed to help with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. EMDR stands for like eye movement directed response or something like that. And it's, it basically is the, the basic idea as I understand it is kind of slowly reintroducing people to things that might be triggering to their PTSD while having them do a series of eye movements that are supposed to be like kind of just distracting enough to keep the person from dissociating and, and get them to be able to integrate that therapeutic re-exposure to the things that trigger them. And rebuilding different pathways in the brain, because we're finding out the way the brain deals with trauma is creating these pathways. And the more you think of that trauma, you're making a stronger kind of pathway. You're making a direct link. Taking that rut deeper. Right, right. And it gets harder to heal. And I've experienced this personally as someone who, you know, has gone through PTSD symptoms. It's, it's infuriating. And like the brain is so complex, but it's just, it can be infuriating and terrifying to not have any control over what your brain is thinking about and just reliving these kinds of traumatic things. Yeah. It can drive you crazy. Yeah. And it's very difficult to learn how to stop that without actual therapy, you know, and I've done a limited amount of therapy. I've done cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a different approach. The therapy that was mentioned before, cognitive behavioral therapy is the idea that there are thoughts that cause feelings. There are thoughts that underlie feelings. And so if we can question those thoughts and whether they're actually true, we can sometimes talk ourself out of feelings that are unwanted or negative. Yeah. And I've had some, some success with that, but it is very difficult when you get into a kind of depression, anxiety cycle to snap out of it. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Really, really hard. I haven't heard anybody say that in a while to someone who's depressed. Like, well, I'll just snap out of it. Cause I think now people are maybe recognizing a little more that you really can't just snap out of it. That's why it's called like a medical condition.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.48, "text": " Okay. Like there is no, there is no inappropriate touching that's included in a massage.
