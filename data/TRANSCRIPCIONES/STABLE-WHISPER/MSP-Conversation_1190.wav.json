{"text": " Tracy Antonea. Hi guys. Hey. Kids books. So Tracy is our resident kids book expert, aren't you Tracy? Kind of. I kind of, I love kids books. It's so much fun. There's, you know, we tend to lose that sense of imagination and fun as we get older, but dipping back into kids books lets you embrace that again and again and again. Just have fun. Yeah, there's so much, so many things that you can do in kids books that you can't do in adult books. Sorry, I'm just thinking if they tried to do it in adult books and how badly that would not work. It would be so much fun if some of it was carried over to adult books. I mean, that's why so many people like to read fantasy because it has that kind of, that anything can happen kind of mentality. I mean, I've just finished reading the new Jack and Moriarty middle grade title, which is coming out next month, I think. It's called The Extremely Inconvenient Adventures of Bronte Metalstone. Very long title. But it was so much fun. It took me almost no time to read, even though it's quite a substantial book. But it was just one adventure after the other and I could, it's just, yeah, you get to play with dragons and play with water sprites and, you know, go on adventures and do lots of fun stuff. Who says kids books are just for kids? They're not. They're not? Everyone should be made to read a kid's book at least once a month just to keep their imagination. Put a smile on your face. Yeah. Yeah. You look at the popularity of the Harry Potter books. They weren't just kids books. Adults read them and continue to read them. I'll buy them for you so that I can read them on my own. Well, I mean, this year alone I've read, right now I'm reading Nevermore by Jessica Townsend, which is just pure adventure. There's so much happening in it and I'm just sitting there going, this is a magical place. And I mean, I've read, what else have I read that's kids? I've read Isabel Carmody. Yeah. Beautiful books. Absolutely beautiful. There's been more, I know it. I know, I can't think of what I've read. I know. I know I've read more and I'm like, what have I read that's middle grade or for kids? I've been reading a lot of them. So I've read The Rogues, which is book one is The Accidental Heroes, a new series by Leanne Tanner, who wrote The Keepers, which is another amazing, adventurous kids series. I've read The Wizard of Once. By Christina Cowell, who wrote the How to Train Your Dragon series. And I have to say, I loved How to Train Your Dragon, but I love this new series even better because it is just so much fun. The characters are, you know, a wizard that has no magic, a warrior who's not supposed to have any magic, but has stolen, in inverted commas, a magical sword from her mother's dungeon and has a spoon of all things. Plus a warrior body. A bodyguard who, anytime there's any danger, falls asleep. So. Interesting. It's such a fun book. This is like a recipe for hilarious disaster, basically. Basically. Oh, he's asleep again. Yep. Pretty standard. And then there's just so many great books coming, you know, even the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which. Just anything Harry Potter can give it to me now. Can't wait for. There's, for those adults who read, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. Yes. There's his, what are they calling it? It's a, um, equal. Not a sequel. It's an equal because it starts before the events of His Dark Materials. So that's coming. It's called La Belle Sauvage, which is coming October, I think it is. Yeah, not long to go. No, that's coming soon. Um, and then there's just so many great books coming for kids this Christmas. Particularly middle grade, I have to say. I remember what I read. I read, The Magic Misfits by Neil Patrick Harris. And yes, Neil Patrick Harris from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. And that was so much fun. I really enjoyed it. It was like about magic, but like illusionist magic, not Harry Potter magic. And it was just a lot of fun. Really diverse set of characters, um, which is good to see in kids' books as well. And I just really enjoyed it. It made me so happy to read it. And I just like sat there in the afternoon and just like read it. And I just had this big smile on my face. So I think that's really good. I have to put that on my list. Yeah. Me too. I read a lot this year, so. And for little kids, um, we've got, there's a picture book coming, um, Imagine, um, John Lennon's song, which is beautiful. Um, beautiful picture book format. Um, Tim Minchin, um, Australian comedian's got When I Grow Up, which looks pretty cool. Um, found to be funny. Zoe Foster-Blake's got that No One Likes a Fart, which kids love. Disgusting fart books and that should be interesting. Um, Aaron Blavius as well. Yeah. I found a book. There's one that I'm going to have to buy for myself. It's called Franklin's Flying, um, Bookshop. And it's, Franklin's a dragon and he has a flying bookshop on his back. Oh, how cool is that? I want a flying bookshop on my back. Bookshop, bookshop. Bookshop. I want them both on my back. I want the dragon. I mean, you look at, I could. Is that the dragon arrives and you can get a book and then he flies off and when he comes back? Or you could just fly around with the dragon all day reading books. You could be the librarian. Yeah. I would totally go for that job. So would I. Tragically check seek. That sounds magical. Who was that by, Zoe? Um, it's by Jen Campbell. It's out now. But, um, and then there's things like the, um, Madeline Finn and the Library Dog, which is a beautiful book about a little girl who's not very confident about reading who reads to the library dog. Cute. And because the dog doesn't worry if she gets anything wrong. She learns how to read. It's very good. It's just adorable. And it's actually, it goes a program that they're doing in real life. Yeah. And various locations where they get children reading to animals. So they don't get stage fright. Yeah. Good books. And animals. You can't go wrong. No. Yeah. There's so many great good kids books coming. Even on my desk right now, I've got a book called The Land of Never Endings by Kate Saunders and it just sounds so cute. I know. And really imaginative and gives me, you know, Enid Blyton vibes and I loved Enid Blyton. So it makes me really excited to go and read it and love it because I feel like I'm going to love it without even reading any of it yet. I was tidying my bookshelf yesterday and I found that one. So I've moved that to the front of my reading list. But hopefully we like it. I think it will. It sounds amazing. This is why I like kids books so much. Like I feel like you can go into them knowing you're going to love it because it just, it's so different from anything else. Yeah. And it's like picking up old friends sometimes. I mean, I love the Enid Blyton. I used to read all the, all of them. Like The Faraway Tree and even like The Famous Five and The Secret Seven. I loved like the Trixie Belden detective stories which were, came out of the US. Nancy Drew. I'm trying to think some of the other really, really good kids books I've read. I mean, I love The Chronicles of Narnia. She's probably started my love of fantasy. I never really, I only read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and I had to read it for school. I never went back to school. I haven't read any of the other ones. All of them. But it always surprises me how short they are. Like I think they're going to be longer and then I see them and I'm like, why are you so little? But yeah, they're some of the books that I read time and time again. And things like Little Women and There Are Minds too. And of Green Gables. On my list as well. I'm trying to think of what else. So many good kids books. And there's something relaxing about coming up and reading one of those books. Like nothing really bad is going to happen. It's all going to work out in the end. And you know, just sit back and have fun. Yeah. And so that's, what were your favourite, we've been sort of discussing this, but what were your favourites as kids? Like did you have a top one that you always went to? I'm going to go through my list because I have a list prepared. I know you're very prepared. I really, really love The Magic Faraway Tree series by Ina Boyden, which I did just reread. I reread them last month and I loved that experience so much. There's so much you just don't pick up on as a kid. And so you reread them and it's like, oh, okay. You said they're an audiobook. They're also good. Yeah. Okay. Next thing to do, Ina Boyden on audiobook. So they, I read a lot of Ina Boyden and I passed it on to my cousins. So like I felt good that I've like given that such a great author. Spread the joy. Yeah. Spread the joy with like people I love. But another favourite was a series called Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism by Georgia Bing. I loved those books so much. They were crazy. Incredible Book of Hypnotism. There was some time travelling, I think, in the third one. It's a series I feel like not many people knew about. And I just remember like the cover, like it was like, I can't explain. I'll have to show you a photo of the cover and you'll be like, oh, like this is why I actually picked it up. But they were a lot of fun. I feel like there's not many books about hypnotism. So like they have stuck in my memory for years because they were so original. And then I have Anna Green Gables and Little Women as well. I loved Meg Cabot. She was one of my favourite authors. In particular, I really liked the Mediator series. But I mean, Princess Diaries is also always great. And then obviously Harry Potter, because who would I be without Harry Potter? Like that's a given. And then I didn't actually read these as kids. I read them only a few years ago. But I feel like if I had read them as a kid, I would have enjoyed them. And that's Percy Jackson by Rick Ryden. I never know how to say his name. Ryden. I think they would have been a lot of fun to read as a kid. Yeah. I mean, most of those came out as well as adults. But in terms of when I was younger, I loved, loved, loved the Harry Potter. Well, we always loved the Harry Potter. The Winnie the Pooh series, I'm thinking of. Yeah. But also Harry Potter. I just, I love Harry Potter, yes. But I love Winnie the Pooh. It's something I just, Eeyore is my favourite character, hands down, out of all of them. But I have a cat named Tigger. And, you know, it's, I have Winnie the Pooh cookie jars and a kettle. And all sorts of weird and wonderful little accessories. That really reminds me of childhood always. Yeah. And how simple and beautiful they are. Yeah. And it's just so much fun. Even, like, sitting back with my niece and nephew watching the movies. And, yeah, they're lots of fun. I'm trying to think of the other kids' books that I really loved. I read so many books as a kid. Yeah, the Enoblite ones were right up there. There's just nothing about them. They're just so much fun. It's like, who wouldn't want to, like, have friends who live in this massive tree? And at the top of the tree is a magical land that changes every few days. That sounds awesome. Who wouldn't want that? Like, and to get back down to the bottom of the tree, because you've climbed it. It's a lot of hard work. A slide in the middle of the tree. Like, who wouldn't want that? That's completely logical. Very logical. I think we should build one here at Wooktopia. And that's how we go home. We slide.", "segments": [{"start": 0.12, "end": 0.36, "text": " Tracy Antonea.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [33724, 5130, 546, 64, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.11751351186207362,

Hi guys. Hey. Kids books. So Tracy is our resident kids book expert, aren't you Tracy? Kind of. I kind of, I love kids books. It's so much fun. There's, you know, we tend to lose that sense of imagination and fun as we get older, but dipping back into kids books lets you embrace that again and again and again. Just have fun. Yeah, there's so much, so many things that you can do in kids books that you can't do in adult books. Sorry, I'm just thinking if they tried to do it in adult books and how badly that would not work. It would be so much fun if some of it was carried over to adult books. I mean, that's why so many people like to read fantasy because it has that kind of, that anything can happen kind of mentality. I mean, I've just finished reading the new Jack and Moriarty middle grade title, which is coming out next month, I think. It's called The Extremely Inconvenient Adventures of Bronte Metalstone. Very long title. But it was so much fun. It took me almost no time to read, even though it's quite a substantial book. But it was just one adventure after the other and I could, it's just, yeah, you get to play with dragons and play with water sprites and, you know, go on adventures and do lots of fun stuff. Who says kids books are just for kids? They're not. They're not? Everyone should be made to read a kid's book at least once a month just to keep their imagination. Put a smile on your face. Yeah. Yeah. You look at the popularity of the Harry Potter books. They weren't just kids books. Adults read them and continue to read them. I'll buy them for you so that I can read them on my own. Well, I mean, this year alone I've read, right now I'm reading Nevermore by Jessica Townsend, which is just pure adventure. There's so much happening in it and I'm just sitting there going, this is a magical place. And I mean, I've read, what else have I read that's kids? I've read Isabel Carmody. Yeah. Beautiful books. Absolutely beautiful. There's been more, I know it. I know, I can't think of what I've read. I know. I know I've read more and I'm like, what have I read that's middle grade or for kids? I've been reading a lot of them. So I've read The Rogues, which is book one is The Accidental Heroes, a new series by Leanne Tanner, who wrote The Keepers, which is another amazing, adventurous kids series. I've read The Wizard of Once. By Christina Cowell, who wrote the How to Train Your Dragon series. And I have to say, I loved How to Train Your Dragon, but I love this new series even better because it is just so much fun. The characters are, you know, a wizard that has no magic, a warrior who's not supposed to have any magic, but has stolen, in inverted commas, a magical sword from her mother's dungeon and has a spoon of all things. Plus a warrior body. A bodyguard who, anytime there's any danger, falls asleep. So. Interesting. It's such a fun book. This is like a recipe for hilarious disaster, basically. Basically. Oh, he's asleep again. Yep. Pretty standard. And then there's just so many great books coming, you know, even the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which. Just anything Harry Potter can give it to me now. Can't wait for. There's, for those adults who read, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. Yes. There's his, what are they calling it? It's a, um, equal. Not a sequel. It's an equal because it starts before the events of His Dark Materials. So that's coming. It's called La Belle Sauvage, which is coming October, I think it is. Yeah, not long to go. No, that's coming soon. Um, and then there's just so many great books coming for kids this Christmas. Particularly middle grade, I have to say. I remember what I read. I read, The Magic Misfits by Neil Patrick Harris. And yes, Neil Patrick Harris from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. And that was so much fun. I really enjoyed it. It was like about magic, but like illusionist magic, not Harry Potter magic. And it was just a lot of fun. Really diverse set of characters, um, which is good to see in kids' books as well. And I just really enjoyed it. It made me so happy to read it. And I just like sat there in the afternoon and just like read it. And I just had this big smile on my face. So I think that's really good. I have to put that on my list. Yeah. Me too. I read a lot this year, so. And for little kids, um, we've got, there's a picture book coming, um, Imagine, um, John Lennon's song, which is beautiful. Um, beautiful picture book format. Um, Tim Minchin, um, Australian comedian's got When I Grow Up, which looks pretty cool. Um, found to be funny. Zoe Foster-Blake's got that No One Likes a Fart, which kids love. Disgusting fart books and that should be interesting. Um, Aaron Blavius as well. Yeah. I found a book. There's one that I'm going to have to buy for myself. It's called Franklin's Flying, um, Bookshop. And it's, Franklin's a dragon and he has a flying bookshop on his back. Oh, how cool is that? I want a flying bookshop on my back. Bookshop, bookshop. Bookshop. I want them both on my back. I want the dragon. I mean, you look at, I could. Is that the dragon arrives and you can get a book and then he flies off and when he comes back? Or you could just fly around with the dragon all day reading books. You could be the librarian. Yeah. I would totally go for that job. So would I. Tragically check seek. That sounds magical. Who was that by, Zoe? Um, it's by Jen Campbell. It's out now. But, um, and then there's things like the, um, Madeline Finn and the Library Dog, which is a beautiful book about a little girl who's not very confident about reading who reads to the library dog. Cute. And because the dog doesn't worry if she gets anything wrong. She learns how to read. It's very good. It's just adorable. And it's actually, it goes a program that they're doing in real life. Yeah. And various locations where they get children reading to animals. So they don't get stage fright. Yeah. Good books. And animals. You can't go wrong. No. Yeah. There's so many great good kids books coming. Even on my desk right now, I've got a book called The Land of Never Endings by Kate Saunders and it just sounds so cute. I know. And really imaginative and gives me, you know, Enid Blyton vibes and I loved Enid Blyton. So it makes me really excited to go and read it and love it because I feel like I'm going to love it without even reading any of it yet. I was tidying my bookshelf yesterday and I found that one. So I've moved that to the front of my reading list. But hopefully we like it. I think it will. It sounds amazing. This is why I like kids books so much. Like I feel like you can go into them knowing you're going to love it because it just, it's so different from anything else. Yeah. And it's like picking up old friends sometimes. I mean, I love the Enid Blyton. I used to read all the, all of them. Like The Faraway Tree and even like The Famous Five and The Secret Seven. I loved like the Trixie Belden detective stories which were, came out of the US. Nancy Drew. I'm trying to think some of the other really, really good kids books I've read. I mean, I love The Chronicles of Narnia. She's probably started my love of fantasy. I never really, I only read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and I had to read it for school. I never went back to school. I haven't read any of the other ones. All of them. But it always surprises me how short they are. Like I think they're going to be longer and then I see them and I'm like, why are you so little? But yeah, they're some of the books that I read time and time again. And things like Little Women and There Are Minds too. And of Green Gables. On my list as well. I'm trying to think of what else. So many good kids books. And there's something relaxing about coming up and reading one of those books. Like nothing really bad is going to happen. It's all going to work out in the end. And you know, just sit back and have fun. Yeah. And so that's, what were your favourite, we've been sort of discussing this, but what were your favourites as kids? Like did you have a top one that you always went to? I'm going to go through my list because I have a list prepared. I know you're very prepared. I really, really love The Magic Faraway Tree series by Ina Boyden, which I did just reread. I reread them last month and I loved that experience so much. There's so much you just don't pick up on as a kid. And so you reread them and it's like, oh, okay. You said they're an audiobook. They're also good. Yeah. Okay. Next thing to do, Ina Boyden on audiobook. So they, I read a lot of Ina Boyden and I passed it on to my cousins. So like I felt good that I've like given that such a great author. Spread the joy. Yeah. Spread the joy with like people I love. But another favourite was a series called Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism by Georgia Bing. I loved those books so much. They were crazy. Incredible Book of Hypnotism. There was some time travelling, I think, in the third one. It's a series I feel like not many people knew about. And I just remember like the cover, like it was like, I can't explain. I'll have to show you a photo of the cover and you'll be like, oh, like this is why I actually picked it up. But they were a lot of fun. I feel like there's not many books about hypnotism. So like they have stuck in my memory for years because they were so original. And then I have Anna Green Gables and Little Women as well. I loved Meg Cabot. She was one of my favourite authors. In particular, I really liked the Mediator series. But I mean, Princess Diaries is also always great. And then obviously Harry Potter, because who would I be without Harry Potter? Like that's a given. And then I didn't actually read these as kids. I read them only a few years ago. But I feel like if I had read them as a kid, I would have enjoyed them. And that's Percy Jackson by Rick Ryden. I never know how to say his name. Ryden. I think they would have been a lot of fun to read as a kid. Yeah. I mean, most of those came out as well as adults. But in terms of when I was younger, I loved, loved, loved the Harry Potter. Well, we always loved the Harry Potter. The Winnie the Pooh series, I'm thinking of. Yeah. But also Harry Potter. I just, I love Harry Potter, yes. But I love Winnie the Pooh. It's something I just, Eeyore is my favourite character, hands down, out of all of them. But I have a cat named Tigger. And, you know, it's, I have Winnie the Pooh cookie jars and a kettle. And all sorts of weird and wonderful little accessories. That really reminds me of childhood always. Yeah. And how simple and beautiful they are. Yeah. And it's just so much fun. Even, like, sitting back with my niece and nephew watching the movies. And, yeah, they're lots of fun. I'm trying to think of the other kids' books that I really loved. I read so many books as a kid. Yeah, the Enoblite ones were right up there. There's just nothing about them. They're just so much fun. It's like, who wouldn't want to, like, have friends who live in this massive tree? And at the top of the tree is a magical land that changes every few days. That sounds awesome. Who wouldn't want that? Like, and to get back down to the bottom of the tree, because you've climbed it. It's a lot of hard work. A slide in the middle of the tree. Like, who wouldn't want that? That's completely logical. Very logical. I think we should build one here at Wooktopia. And that's how we go home. We slide.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.12, "end": 7.8, "text": " Tracy Antonea. Hi guys. Hey. Kids books.
