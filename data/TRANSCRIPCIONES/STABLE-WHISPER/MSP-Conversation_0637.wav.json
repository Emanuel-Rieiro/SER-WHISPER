{"text": " Welcome to the third panel episode of Polite Conversations on the Burkini Hijab-Nakab debate. Today I have an excellent panel for you, one that's been quite tricky to assemble, actually. We've got Sarah Hader. Hello. Writer, activist, and co-founder of Ex-Muslims of North America. And we have Hoda Khatibi. Yes. Muslim-Iranian activist and blogger at Juju Asad. She's also the author of the book Tehran's Street Style. And we also have Hala Arafa, who is a former newscaster and news editor at the Voice of America Arabic branch. Hello. How are you guys? Hopefully we're all well. I'm so glad you all could make it. I have tried to get so many people on to discuss this topic, and I can tell you how many people turned me down. Oh. Yeah. It seems to be like not everyone wants to have this discussion. I wonder why. But okay, so Sarah, you wrote a really good piece on this. It was really balanced and fair. And of course, on Twitter, you were attacked for that. Yes. Yes. So what were some of the things that you were talking about in your book? Well, generally speaking, I mean, I understand why people feel the need to fight back against Islamism and, you know, the hijab and the, you know, burkini and various, you know, very obviously religious gear, garb. I can understand why people feel that, you know, if we eliminate this, it will ease tensions. It will, you know, somehow send a message, the right kind of message that we want you to assimilate. I just don't think that it's very intelligent. I don't think it's very practical. I don't think it does what you want it to do, which is to say that I don't think it curbs extremism in any real sense. And I don't think it helps the most vulnerable Muslim women. Right. And actually, it turns out it boosted burkini sales. Right. So yeah, I think I agree with you quite a bit on that. I've been pretty open about how critical I am about religious modesty, garb, but I don't necessarily agree with banning it because I don't think it's effective. I think you have to coax people out of these types of beliefs and not force them out of these types of beliefs. And Hoda, you are the only person on our panel that has a current experience, I guess, everyday experience wearing the hijab, right? Do you wear a burkini? No, I haven't been. I've always lived in a landlocked state in the United States, so no chance to wear a burkini. I also live in the fashion industry and don't find them particularly fashion forward, so I just haven't worn them. Well, what do you, do you go swimming at all in the pool or? Um, I've gone swimming when I was in Iran, I went swimming. Um, and there you don't need a burkini because they just actually just section off a whole part of the Caspian Sea for you. Um, and women would wear whatever they wanted. How do they, how do they do that effectively? Um, it's not the most effective thing. Um, it's actually, it's more lax than people would imagine. Um, it's basically like, um, like the material that tents are made out of, but it's kind of built into the water and they just kind of, like a little wall basically, um, on both sides and it's just an expansive area. Everything is segregated there, so I think it would be difficult. Well, not everything. Um, some things are segregated, yeah, but definitely not everything. Do you feel that like, uh, the hijab and these modesty coverings are a form of segregation or no? Um, I don't think that necessarily a hijab is a form of segregation. Um, especially, I think we should also talk about the difference with a Muslim woman or a woman wearing a hijab. In Iran, where it is mandatory or in Saudi Arabia, um, than a woman choosing to wear a hijab freely in France or the United States, for example. Like, I think those have very different significance to them. Absolutely. But I mean, firstly, we can't really say who's choosing and who's not because it's just, it's very hard to gauge that, right? Like there's subtle pressures as well from family. Like I have family members that wear hijab and, uh, I have a, a relative that puts her nine-year-old in a hijab who is obviously not old enough to consent to it. Yeah, but I mean, I, I do think that there is pressure to wear a hijab, but I think there's also pressure not to wear a hijab. Like as a Muslim woman who chooses to wear the hijab in the United States, if anything at all, um, all I've seen around me are people constantly saying, take it off, take it off, you know, like, oh, I'm sure your hair is pretty, take off your hijab. You know, people have actually pulled it off my head. So I think that they're equal, if not more pressure to take off the hijab. Uh, I don't, I don't think, I don't know if it would be equal at all. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say equal. Come on, Hoda. In other countries, they will throw, uh, acid on the face of anybody who's not wearing it, including Christians. This is, I'm talking about Egypt. Right. And, um, I've seen Christian women, actually, my mom died, um, last April. So I had to do some stuff in the, uh, um, government and certain papers. And I went in and I saw this woman with a cross on her head. On her, um, forearm. And, but she's wearing a hijab. I told her, what are you doing? Why are you, she said, if I go home, if I walk on my street, not wearing the hijab, I, I'd be attacked. So I'm wearing it. I don't. Yeah, I know. I think that's obviously very, very awful. But saying that for me and my experience, and also like other millions of Muslims around the world to kind of take that away that we feel we don't see constant pressure to take off the hijab. Like, I was physically assaulted multiple times. Like I was beaten up for wearing the hijab. Um, and I've never had that threat in Oklahoma. Where is that? In the United States. You were beaten up? Yes. For wearing a hijab? Where? Yes. How? In Oklahoma and the United States. Like just walking down the street? From a kid in my school. I was in school and a kid actually, after he continuously called me a terrorist and he's like, you should take it off. And I kept saying no. And he beat me up. And a teacher actually, who was standing there turned around. So she didn't have to see it. So again, like I'm, I'm not at all saying that there's no pressure from Muslims to, for other people to wear the, like other Muslim women to wear the hijab. Like, of course, I think that's bad. But for me, at least there's been tremendous, extreme, more pressure coming from the outside for me to take it off so much more. And for other millions of other Muslims, um, I've talked to so many other Muslim women who also have faced similar experiences. So it definitely is like equal, if not more. Why did you choose to wear it? This is Hala. I just want to know why did you choose to wear it? Well, I think, um, it's definitely for me, it's a, it's a fluid part of my identity. So it's something that changes. So I can't say I've always worn it for the exact same reasons, just the same reason that, cause I, so I work in fashion, the way that I dress has changed also for, you know, throughout the course of my life. Um, but also I think it's important not to let one person's choice and relationship to the hijab become a standard for all women, because there's billions of women. Um, no, no, I get that. But when you say that there's, if more, if not equal, if not more pressure to take off the hijab, I think that's, that's hugely inaccurate. I mean, I totally get that there is pressure to take it off sometimes. Um, and I can see why that would be a deterrent when someone is constantly telling you to do something, that's something that you really wouldn't want to do. But I don't think it's, uh, in any way comparable to like, if you think of the majority of hijab wearing women, where, where do they reside? They reside in the Muslim world. And what happens there? They don't get a choice. So, I mean, I don't, that's what I'm saying. Like, like regulatory, like forced to job as in like a state sanctioned thing. Like I'm against that a hundred percent, but to say that I haven't, or many other Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab in the United States haven't received, um, more pressure to take off the hijab than put it on, I think is like denying my experiences. But even in the West though, we can't even begin to gauge how many women are pressured into it. So we can't. Yeah, I know. But we also can't say that it's just, um, completely inaccurate, uh, that I haven't received or other Muslim women. I'm not negating your experience at all. I'm saying, I know absolutely that you must have faced discrimination or whatever because of it. And I am completely against that as well. You know, I stand up against that kind of stuff all the time, but I just don't think that it's fair to say that it is equal, if not more pressure to remove the hijab, because I don't see anyone forcing you to take it off. If it's some crazy dude on the street, maybe, but that's a one-off experience. It's not like your regular. But it's not though. Like, I would love to agree with you, but like, it's not like, again, I'm talking from my personal experience, but there's also countless statistics and surveys that prove that this is a very large problem. Like that people are ripping off hijabs. No, I beg to differ. No, no, no, no, no. But like, I, I work very closely with care. I work very closely with organizations that document this information. Like, I'm not just like making it up, you know, like it's like, I think it's just kind of like a yes, no kind of game. But like, you can't deny my experiences are just like the countless women that I've talked to. Okay. But how is that saying that that doesn't negate the fact that Muslims still face discrimination? It doesn't make, I never, never once said that Muslims have more discrimination than the world. Yes. 153 incidents over a period of a year in 50 states does not, it does not mean it's widespread. Yes. There are some, some Americans who might be scared with good reason. There's never good reason to like rip someone's hijab off. I think just, but like, also, I think I never reported the fact that my hijab was torn up or the fact that I was beaten up to the FBI. You should. But like a lot of Muslims, Muslims don't, but you were beaten up in the schoolyard, right? I mean, this is like a children's fight though. This is different from adult children's fight. But like when you see things on the news, like it, it shows that we're part of a culture. This is all part of like a culture of Islamophobia that's cultivated in the United States. Can I, can I just like a schoolyard? Like, Oh, like, Oh, you like talk to my crush or something. It's not that like you clearly, when they call you a terrorist, you know, when they call you like, Oh, take that thing off your head, you know, like all these sort of things like, don't, Oh, don't blow me up. Where's the bomb? Like it's more than just like a schoolyard thing. It's obviously related to what they hear on their television screen. As ex-Muslims, we still get that, right? I'm not an ex-Muslim. I'm a very, very pious practicing Muslim. No, no, no. But I'm saying even as ex-Muslims like Sarah and I are, we still get anti-Muslim bigotry directed towards us. I get told that I should be sterilized because I can't be trusted to breed and stuff like that. So I get it. I've personally experienced it. I'm just trying to, get some sense of proportion here. Well, I think, I mean, I think it's important here to sort of clarify what we're talking about. Cause I think we're talking over each other, but for one, I don't think anyone is saying that it's impossible that women who wear the hijab get, you know, harassed or, or there are some, some forces that pull them in the direction of taking off the hijab. I don't think that, I don't think that that's really being denied here by anybody. And I, I agree that, that it happens. And I've, I've even, you know, seen it happen. Um, but I think it's important to make a distinction between what's happening in the aggregate and, and perhaps an individual experience that is very much different from the aggregate. So I think it's fair to say that there are, um, there are stronger polls with perhaps the average Muslim woman. Now I don't have data here, but I'm just speaking from what I think is reasonable analysis of what we do have to say that the average Muslim woman might experience a stronger poll to be more modest to, to put on the hijab than she does to take it off. Not to say that she doesn't have any polls to take it off to just that there's a greater poll in one direction. And it's coming from family, friends, community. And I think that's the most important thing because those are the people you don't want to leave. Those are the people you don't want to be isolated from. And so they have, you know, just, I've just a overwhelmingly strong, um, presence when it comes to, you know, coercive action one way or another. Yeah. So actually, um, so I do a lot of research in Iran, um, because I'm Iranian. Um, all my research is focused in Iran. I think it's a really interesting country. Um, in Iran among the youth, uh, it's actually the opposite. So despite the fact that there's a law, like a mandatory law for all women to be wearing the hijab, it's, you're pulled by your friends to take it off or kind of like have this sort of like pulling it, you know, there's having your ponytail and just setting it on your ponytail or like having it around your shoulders until the cops come up. Actually people who wear the hijab and cover up all their hair are looked down upon. Like so many times I've been in a car with young people where they're like, Oh, how many points do I get if I run over this? Like person who's wearing, you know, like wearing dress from head to toe and like religious like garments. So it's not at all. Like, I think like even in Iran where the rule is to wear a hijab, like you, it's more important for young people to be like taking it off. There's a very stronger pull for younger people to be taking it off and keeping it on. But in the larger scheme of things, the pull of the law is obviously stronger than what's, you know, a few dissenters want to do. But no, I'm talking about like pools though. Like what, what you feel socially obligate, obliged to do and where you feel that like, just like in the United States, like you're, um, I think, sorry, what's your name? Sarah, that you mentioned. Say like, um, you're just talking about how the community and family and friends are pulling you, you know, to like put it on. Um, but again, you can't say that if you live in the United States, you don't constantly know that social, like the social hierarchies in this country are, you do not wear a hijab if you want. Like even like when I go to fashion week, for example, you can tell immediately that people look down on me because I choose to wear a hijab. Like there's a very clear, like social hierarchy that's built that pushes women, especially younger women to want to take off their hijab in the United States, but also in Iran. Is it looking down on you or is it like a legitimate form of confusion? Like, cause, cause your hijab is saying one thing and then you're, you know, at fashion week, you're a fashion blogger. To me, that's very, that's, that's contradictory, right? Because how is the contradictory? Well, I heard you say in an interview, uh, or on, um, I think I heard a talk you were doing with, um, Asra and there you were asked about why you wear the hijab. And you said that, you know, for you, it's something that keeps you focused and away from the superficialities of life, right? Like to not focus on outer beauty. Things like that. But then fashion. Well, I think also fashion is more than outer beauty. Fashion is an art. Fashion is a form of self-expression. Yeah, but that's outer beauty. But no, no, no. I mean, it's, it's art. Like it's, it's different. Um, I think what I mean by outer beauty is not just like, Oh, let me wear the latest trends. Um, that's like, I think outer beauty is a superficial dependence on, um, external affirmation on the way that you look. But you follow hijabi fashion bloggers, right? But I mean, I follow for aesthetic reasons. Yeah. Just like I followed art blogs. I follow Muslim women artists. Like I think it's an art. I don't think it's like, in that realm, there will be trends as well. Right. So it's not really just necessarily about what's happening in cosmopolitan magazine. It's about different trends everywhere. It's just like what people are, everyone decides to be wearing. What kind of is like inspiring the current, maybe it's based on political climate. Maybe it's based on, you know, whatever the season, but I think it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean that it's necessarily baseless. In fact, I think that calling the fashion industry, a shallow industry or something that's just based on just external is like almost anti-feminist because historically within it's always been a very feminine, like women's centered and women dominated industry. And so a lot of patriarchal people always call fashion as like, Oh, you know, the shallow little thing because it's dominated by women and women's work is never valued. But I think fashion is very deep and has the potential to be an incredibly powerful and moving force, um, for social change, um, for art. For aesthetic reasons. So, yeah, I think it's, it's important. I think it makes a lot of sense together. The hijab and the, and fashion, you mean? Yeah, definitely. Um, I'm confused. I'm sorry. I'm older than all of you probably. So, uh, much older. I'll be your mom, probably each and every one of you, but, um, it's just the, the confusion between, I want to cover up and I want to be in public space and I want to look good, but I don't want anybody to see me. It's just that I grew up in an extremely open society. Nobody was wearing the hijab until the 1980s when the conservative movement from Saudi Arabia started invading Egypt and everybody thought it was just a regressive movement and it's never going to catch on, uh, because the woman loves to get dressed up, put makeup and everything. It's a, it goes against the woman's nature. And we were studying when we were young about the women's liberation movement and how they took off the Turkish Ottoman, um, Yashmak, we call it, which is basically the complete cover. But the complete cover came with. Like a burqa, you mean? Like the face of a sword? No, it's not like a burqa. It's just, it's a different, it, well, it, it covers completely and it has a white thing on it. But is the face covered or the face is? Yes, it is with the white, with the white thing. It's called Yashmak. Anyway, yes, the face is covered, but, but at the same time, if you want to cover the woman to protect her in, in the idea of that time, 200 years ago, um, then the, they, the woman stays at home. She doesn't go to school. She doesn't work outside the home. And this is the whole idea, the package of cover protect.", "segments": [{"start": 0.16, "end": 6.84, "text": " Welcome to the third panel episode of Polite Conversations on the Burkini Hijab-Nakab

Conversations on the Burkini Hijab-Nakab debate. Today I have an excellent panel for you, one that's been quite tricky to assemble, actually. We've got Sarah Hader. Hello. Writer, activist, and co-founder of Ex-Muslims of North America. And we have Hoda Khatibi. Yes. Muslim-Iranian activist and blogger at Juju Asad. She's also the author of the book Tehran's Street Style. And we also have Hala Arafa, who is a former newscaster and news editor at the Voice of America Arabic branch. Hello. How are you guys? Hopefully we're all well. I'm so glad you all could make it. I have tried to get so many people on to discuss this topic, and I can tell you how many people turned me down. Oh. Yeah. It seems to be like not everyone wants to have this discussion. I wonder why. But okay, so Sarah, you wrote a really good piece on this. It was really balanced and fair. And of course, on Twitter, you were attacked for that. Yes. Yes. So what were some of the things that you were talking about in your book? Well, generally speaking, I mean, I understand why people feel the need to fight back against Islamism and, you know, the hijab and the, you know, burkini and various, you know, very obviously religious gear, garb. I can understand why people feel that, you know, if we eliminate this, it will ease tensions. It will, you know, somehow send a message, the right kind of message that we want you to assimilate. I just don't think that it's very intelligent. I don't think it's very practical. I don't think it does what you want it to do, which is to say that I don't think it curbs extremism in any real sense. And I don't think it helps the most vulnerable Muslim women. Right. And actually, it turns out it boosted burkini sales. Right. So yeah, I think I agree with you quite a bit on that. I've been pretty open about how critical I am about religious modesty, garb, but I don't necessarily agree with banning it because I don't think it's effective. I think you have to coax people out of these types of beliefs and not force them out of these types of beliefs. And Hoda, you are the only person on our panel that has a current experience, I guess, everyday experience wearing the hijab, right? Do you wear a burkini? No, I haven't been. I've always lived in a landlocked state in the United States, so no chance to wear a burkini. I also live in the fashion industry and don't find them particularly fashion forward, so I just haven't worn them. Well, what do you, do you go swimming at all in the pool or? Um, I've gone swimming when I was in Iran, I went swimming. Um, and there you don't need a burkini because they just actually just section off a whole part of the Caspian Sea for you. Um, and women would wear whatever they wanted. How do they, how do they do that effectively? Um, it's not the most effective thing. Um, it's actually, it's more lax than people would imagine. Um, it's basically like, um, like the material that tents are made out of, but it's kind of built into the water and they just kind of, like a little wall basically, um, on both sides and it's just an expansive area. Everything is segregated there, so I think it would be difficult. Well, not everything. Um, some things are segregated, yeah, but definitely not everything. Do you feel that like, uh, the hijab and these modesty coverings are a form of segregation or no? Um, I don't think that necessarily a hijab is a form of segregation. Um, especially, I think we should also talk about the difference with a Muslim woman or a woman wearing a hijab. In Iran, where it is mandatory or in Saudi Arabia, um, than a woman choosing to wear a hijab freely in France or the United States, for example. Like, I think those have very different significance to them. Absolutely. But I mean, firstly, we can't really say who's choosing and who's not because it's just, it's very hard to gauge that, right? Like there's subtle pressures as well from family. Like I have family members that wear hijab and, uh, I have a, a relative that puts her nine-year-old in a hijab who is obviously not old enough to consent to it. Yeah, but I mean, I, I do think that there is pressure to wear a hijab, but I think there's also pressure not to wear a hijab. Like as a Muslim woman who chooses to wear the hijab in the United States, if anything at all, um, all I've seen around me are people constantly saying, take it off, take it off, you know, like, oh, I'm sure your hair is pretty, take off your hijab. You know, people have actually pulled it off my head. So I think that they're equal, if not more pressure to take off the hijab. Uh, I don't, I don't think, I don't know if it would be equal at all. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say equal. Come on, Hoda. In other countries, they will throw, uh, acid on the face of anybody who's not wearing it, including Christians. This is, I'm talking about Egypt. Right. And, um, I've seen Christian women, actually, my mom died, um, last April. So I had to do some stuff in the, uh, um, government and certain papers. And I went in and I saw this woman with a cross on her head. On her, um, forearm. And, but she's wearing a hijab. I told her, what are you doing? Why are you, she said, if I go home, if I walk on my street, not wearing the hijab, I, I'd be attacked. So I'm wearing it. I don't. Yeah, I know. I think that's obviously very, very awful. But saying that for me and my experience, and also like other millions of Muslims around the world to kind of take that away that we feel we don't see constant pressure to take off the hijab. Like, I was physically assaulted multiple times. Like I was beaten up for wearing the hijab. Um, and I've never had that threat in Oklahoma. Where is that? In the United States. You were beaten up? Yes. For wearing a hijab? Where? Yes. How? In Oklahoma and the United States. Like just walking down the street? From a kid in my school. I was in school and a kid actually, after he continuously called me a terrorist and he's like, you should take it off. And I kept saying no. And he beat me up. And a teacher actually, who was standing there turned around. So she didn't have to see it. So again, like I'm, I'm not at all saying that there's no pressure from Muslims to, for other people to wear the, like other Muslim women to wear the hijab. Like, of course, I think that's bad. But for me, at least there's been tremendous, extreme, more pressure coming from the outside for me to take it off so much more. And for other millions of other Muslims, um, I've talked to so many other Muslim women who also have faced similar experiences. So it definitely is like equal, if not more. Why did you choose to wear it? This is Hala. I just want to know why did you choose to wear it? Well, I think, um, it's definitely for me, it's a, it's a fluid part of my identity. So it's something that changes. So I can't say I've always worn it for the exact same reasons, just the same reason that, cause I, so I work in fashion, the way that I dress has changed also for, you know, throughout the course of my life. Um, but also I think it's important not to let one person's choice and relationship to the hijab become a standard for all women, because there's billions of women. Um, no, no, I get that. But when you say that there's, if more, if not equal, if not more pressure to take off the hijab, I think that's, that's hugely inaccurate. I mean, I totally get that there is pressure to take it off sometimes. Um, and I can see why that would be a deterrent when someone is constantly telling you to do something, that's something that you really wouldn't want to do. But I don't think it's, uh, in any way comparable to like, if you think of the majority of hijab wearing women, where, where do they reside? They reside in the Muslim world. And what happens there? They don't get a choice. So, I mean, I don't, that's what I'm saying. Like, like regulatory, like forced to job as in like a state sanctioned thing. Like I'm against that a hundred percent, but to say that I haven't, or many other Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab in the United States haven't received, um, more pressure to take off the hijab than put it on, I think is like denying my experiences. But even in the West though, we can't even begin to gauge how many women are pressured into it. So we can't. Yeah, I know. But we also can't say that it's just, um, completely inaccurate, uh, that I haven't received or other Muslim women. I'm not negating your experience at all. I'm saying, I know absolutely that you must have faced discrimination or whatever because of it. And I am completely against that as well. You know, I stand up against that kind of stuff all the time, but I just don't think that it's fair to say that it is equal, if not more pressure to remove the hijab, because I don't see anyone forcing you to take it off. If it's some crazy dude on the street, maybe, but that's a one-off experience. It's not like your regular. But it's not though. Like, I would love to agree with you, but like, it's not like, again, I'm talking from my personal experience, but there's also countless statistics and surveys that prove that this is a very large problem. Like that people are ripping off hijabs. No, I beg to differ. No, no, no, no, no. But like, I, I work very closely with care. I work very closely with organizations that document this information. Like, I'm not just like making it up, you know, like it's like, I think it's just kind of like a yes, no kind of game. But like, you can't deny my experiences are just like the countless women that I've talked to. Okay. But how is that saying that that doesn't negate the fact that Muslims still face discrimination? It doesn't make, I never, never once said that Muslims have more discrimination than the world. Yes. 153 incidents over a period of a year in 50 states does not, it does not mean it's widespread. Yes. There are some, some Americans who might be scared with good reason. There's never good reason to like rip someone's hijab off. I think just, but like, also, I think I never reported the fact that my hijab was torn up or the fact that I was beaten up to the FBI. You should. But like a lot of Muslims, Muslims don't, but you were beaten up in the schoolyard, right? I mean, this is like a children's fight though. This is different from adult children's fight. But like when you see things on the news, like it, it shows that we're part of a culture. This is all part of like a culture of Islamophobia that's cultivated in the United States. Can I, can I just like a schoolyard? Like, Oh, like, Oh, you like talk to my crush or something. It's not that like you clearly, when they call you a terrorist, you know, when they call you like, Oh, take that thing off your head, you know, like all these sort of things like, don't, Oh, don't blow me up. Where's the bomb? Like it's more than just like a schoolyard thing. It's obviously related to what they hear on their television screen. As ex-Muslims, we still get that, right? I'm not an ex-Muslim. I'm a very, very pious practicing Muslim. No, no, no. But I'm saying even as ex-Muslims like Sarah and I are, we still get anti-Muslim bigotry directed towards us. I get told that I should be sterilized because I can't be trusted to breed and stuff like that. So I get it. I've personally experienced it. I'm just trying to, get some sense of proportion here. Well, I think, I mean, I think it's important here to sort of clarify what we're talking about. Cause I think we're talking over each other, but for one, I don't think anyone is saying that it's impossible that women who wear the hijab get, you know, harassed or, or there are some, some forces that pull them in the direction of taking off the hijab. I don't think that, I don't think that that's really being denied here by anybody. And I, I agree that, that it happens. And I've, I've even, you know, seen it happen. Um, but I think it's important to make a distinction between what's happening in the aggregate and, and perhaps an individual experience that is very much different from the aggregate. So I think it's fair to say that there are, um, there are stronger polls with perhaps the average Muslim woman. Now I don't have data here, but I'm just speaking from what I think is reasonable analysis of what we do have to say that the average Muslim woman might experience a stronger poll to be more modest to, to put on the hijab than she does to take it off. Not to say that she doesn't have any polls to take it off to just that there's a greater poll in one direction. And it's coming from family, friends, community. And I think that's the most important thing because those are the people you don't want to leave. Those are the people you don't want to be isolated from. And so they have, you know, just, I've just a overwhelmingly strong, um, presence when it comes to, you know, coercive action one way or another. Yeah. So actually, um, so I do a lot of research in Iran, um, because I'm Iranian. Um, all my research is focused in Iran. I think it's a really interesting country. Um, in Iran among the youth, uh, it's actually the opposite. So despite the fact that there's a law, like a mandatory law for all women to be wearing the hijab, it's, you're pulled by your friends to take it off or kind of like have this sort of like pulling it, you know, there's having your ponytail and just setting it on your ponytail or like having it around your shoulders until the cops come up. Actually people who wear the hijab and cover up all their hair are looked down upon. Like so many times I've been in a car with young people where they're like, Oh, how many points do I get if I run over this? Like person who's wearing, you know, like wearing dress from head to toe and like religious like garments. So it's not at all. Like, I think like even in Iran where the rule is to wear a hijab, like you, it's more important for young people to be like taking it off. There's a very stronger pull for younger people to be taking it off and keeping it on. But in the larger scheme of things, the pull of the law is obviously stronger than what's, you know, a few dissenters want to do. But no, I'm talking about like pools though. Like what, what you feel socially obligate, obliged to do and where you feel that like, just like in the United States, like you're, um, I think, sorry, what's your name? Sarah, that you mentioned. Say like, um, you're just talking about how the community and family and friends are pulling you, you know, to like put it on. Um, but again, you can't say that if you live in the United States, you don't constantly know that social, like the social hierarchies in this country are, you do not wear a hijab if you want. Like even like when I go to fashion week, for example, you can tell immediately that people look down on me because I choose to wear a hijab. Like there's a very clear, like social hierarchy that's built that pushes women, especially younger women to want to take off their hijab in the United States, but also in Iran. Is it looking down on you or is it like a legitimate form of confusion? Like, cause, cause your hijab is saying one thing and then you're, you know, at fashion week, you're a fashion blogger. To me, that's very, that's, that's contradictory, right? Because how is the contradictory? Well, I heard you say in an interview, uh, or on, um, I think I heard a talk you were doing with, um, Asra and there you were asked about why you wear the hijab. And you said that, you know, for you, it's something that keeps you focused and away from the superficialities of life, right? Like to not focus on outer beauty. Things like that. But then fashion. Well, I think also fashion is more than outer beauty. Fashion is an art. Fashion is a form of self-expression. Yeah, but that's outer beauty. But no, no, no. I mean, it's, it's art. Like it's, it's different. Um, I think what I mean by outer beauty is not just like, Oh, let me wear the latest trends. Um, that's like, I think outer beauty is a superficial dependence on, um, external affirmation on the way that you look. But you follow hijabi fashion bloggers, right? But I mean, I follow for aesthetic reasons. Yeah. Just like I followed art blogs. I follow Muslim women artists. Like I think it's an art. I don't think it's like, in that realm, there will be trends as well. Right. So it's not really just necessarily about what's happening in cosmopolitan magazine. It's about different trends everywhere. It's just like what people are, everyone decides to be wearing. What kind of is like inspiring the current, maybe it's based on political climate. Maybe it's based on, you know, whatever the season, but I think it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean that it's necessarily baseless. In fact, I think that calling the fashion industry, a shallow industry or something that's just based on just external is like almost anti-feminist because historically within it's always been a very feminine, like women's centered and women dominated industry. And so a lot of patriarchal people always call fashion as like, Oh, you know, the shallow little thing because it's dominated by women and women's work is never valued. But I think fashion is very deep and has the potential to be an incredibly powerful and moving force, um, for social change, um, for art. For aesthetic reasons. So, yeah, I think it's, it's important. I think it makes a lot of sense together. The hijab and the, and fashion, you mean? Yeah, definitely. Um, I'm confused. I'm sorry. I'm older than all of you probably. So, uh, much older. I'll be your mom, probably each and every one of you, but, um, it's just the, the confusion between, I want to cover up and I want to be in public space and I want to look good, but I don't want anybody to see me. It's just that I grew up in an extremely open society. Nobody was wearing the hijab until the 1980s when the conservative movement from Saudi Arabia started invading Egypt and everybody thought it was just a regressive movement and it's never going to catch on, uh, because the woman loves to get dressed up, put makeup and everything. It's a, it goes against the woman's nature. And we were studying when we were young about the women's liberation movement and how they took off the Turkish Ottoman, um, Yashmak, we call it, which is basically the complete cover. But the complete cover came with. Like a burqa, you mean? Like the face of a sword? No, it's not like a burqa. It's just, it's a different, it, well, it, it covers completely and it has a white thing on it. But is the face covered or the face is? Yes, it is with the white, with the white thing. It's called Yashmak. Anyway, yes, the face is covered, but, but at the same time, if you want to cover the woman to protect her in, in the idea of that time, 200 years ago, um, then the, they, the woman stays at home. She doesn't go to school. She doesn't work outside the home. And this is the whole idea, the package of cover protect.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.16, "end": 6.84, "text": " Welcome to the third panel episode of Polite Conversations on the Burkini
