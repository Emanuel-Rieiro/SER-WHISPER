{"text": " and people should also follow you on Twitter because you post a lot of good audio-related stories. I'm curious where you find all these stories, Steve. Are they just things that you run across, you read in the newspaper? Are you following some other people that put out a lot of good articles? I follow a lot of people on Twitter, actually. I think Twitter's fantastic. I get most of my audio news off Twitter now. Or I use something called scoop.it where I store all this information. Which I do selfishly, really, because I think it's all going to be useful to me at some point. Hopefully it's useful to other people, too. Can you tell us some other good people to follow for audio-related things on Twitter? You know, everyone from someone like Martin Ware, who was a big sort of pop icon in the 70s in the UK with bands like Heaven 17 and Human League. Who's now a sound artist and involved in all sorts of other stuff. He's fascinating to follow. You know, Scanner is quite interesting, but he doesn't post very many links, but he's always quite lively. I mean, there's people like, there's a guy called Des Coulombe, who's an audio recordist out in, who lives, an Englishman who lives in Paris. And his posts are just fantastic. I mean, he just posts some wonderful ambient sounds from Paris that are just, you know, you can just lose yourself in completely. So tell me about your main gig at the Royal Exchange Theatre Company in Manchester. This is a large multi-room performance space, just from the photos that I saw online and the information on the website. So do you supervise a team of technicians there or do you design all of their shows? What are your responsibilities? Well, I'm head of sound for the Royal Exchange Theatre Company in Manchester. There's a team of four who I manage. A fantastically talented team of young sound designers, young technicians. I don't design all the shows there. I've designed probably near enough 100 shows there in my time. But we get a lot of guest sound designers now. And my job really is to supervise their work and use the experience I've got of the space. And it's an amazing theatre. It's a seven-sided theatre in the round. And it's worth looking up online to have a look at some pictures of it. Constructed completely out of steel and glass in the centre of Manchester. It actually sits in the old Cotton Exchange in Manchester city centre. And it looks a bit like a lunar module has landed in the middle of this very old room, which is arguably the largest room in the world. Three levels. It's a sound designer's dream in many ways. We can put sound above the audience, below the audience, inside the theatre or outside the theatre. It's about 400 tyre lines around the building. Wow. And we can put loudspeakers virtually anywhere to hopefully create a fully immersive surround sound experience for the audience. It's a challenging space to work in. It's not a place where you'd probably want to design a show if you're new to sound design. It's a place where you have to make a lot of very critical decisions very quickly. What would you say is the most challenging thing for the guest sound designers that are coming in, they're most surprised with? They say, oh, I have to decide this and that? It's the sheer number of loudspeakers you use, I think. We've got a large system. We can use anything between 70 and 120 loudspeakers. And for a drama show, that's actually quite a lot. You're doing a big musical. But for a check-off, that's a lot of loudspeakers. The system is a Maya system. We have 56 UPM ones, a load of MSL2s, UPAs, USWs. And we've also got a lot of control ones, which we use for surround sound. The biggest challenge for a sound designer coming in is really you need to have planned what you're going to do in quite a lot of detail before you start. Because we turn around shows quite quickly, if you're not clear about what you want to achieve, you can be going around in circles, literally. You can be going around in circles for hours and days, trying to get the effect you're after. What are some of your favorite parts about the space that make you really like to work there? Well, I think the most important thing about the space is that it's one that's really shared between the audience and the performer. I mean, the audience enter through the same, to the auditorium through the same doors the performers enter and exit in performance. So it really is a shared space. And no member of the audience is further than nine meters from the center of the stage. Wow. Which is phenomenal. It's a unique design. And it truly is a remarkable place to experience any theater. And as the sound designer, you can make the audience feel as if they're exactly in the room, next to the actor, which indeed they almost are. Or you can make them feel like a tiny grain of sand on a huge desert. So you can really use sound as a focusing tool in quite a unique way. I'm impressed that you're so active with professional organizations because I've been a member of the AES. Theater Bay Area. And I've tried contacting our local unions a few times, but I could never really see how it was benefiting. So I dropped most of my memberships. And I see that you're active with an international theatrical union. Could you talk a little bit about how the union, as well as other professional organizations, you're a part of affect your day-to-day work and the day-to-day work of other theater employees and contractors? And I don't know why people should be involved. The organizations, I'm involved with, I wouldn't ever really call them unions, which I see as organizations which campaign on behalf of employees for better working conditions. And I use to as a negotiating tool. For instance, OISTAP, which is the International Organization of Sonographers, Theater Architects and Technicians, has a sound design working group, which I lead. And really, our primary objective is to support and encourage professional relationships between sound designers internationally and encourage knowledge sharing and mentoring and also sharing a beer when we get together. On the rare occasions we all get together from various parts of the world. It really is an important organization for global communication, really, between sound designers. I mean, I've lots of friends who are sound designers in the United States, and friends, obviously, are sound designers in the United Kingdom. But since being part of the OISTAP sound design working group, I have sound designers who are acquaintances and friends in Bangladesh and India and Japan and the Philippines and all these amazing places where we don't really understand what they do and how they work. And they have a lot to offer in terms of techniques, ideas, attitudes, which we can all learn from. And what I'm trying to do and what I try to do and what the OISTAP sound design working group tries to do is pull all these people together and make really an international community of like-minded professionals. But our next in-person meeting will be at World Stage Design, which is happening in Cardiff next September, just about a year away from now, which is basically a theater design exhibition and there's a number of workshops and presentations and all sorts of things. And I've been busy organizing a number of events for next year's World Stage Design, which happens between September the 8th and September the 15th in Cardiff in Wales. And it's going to be at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, which is a fantastic, fantastic institution. And a brand new concert hall, which is amazing, and a brand new theater there, which we're using. They've given me the concert hall for a week to program various events, which is such a luxury. It's a fantastic honor as well. That sounds great. Well, tell me about one of the events that you're programming. I'll tell you who I've invited over, who I'm 80% sure these people will be part of the event. There's a sound designer and director from India called Dinesh Yadav, who's a fascinating musician, theater director, designer, sound designer, composer. An amazing guy from New Zealand called Daniel Belton, who's a dancer and sound designer, whose work you really need to check out on YouTube and Vimeo. There's a guy called Bassam, I'm hoping I'm pronouncing all these names correctly, by the way. Bassam Yakot from Egypt, who's a sound designer from Egypt, who's been doing some fantastic stuff out there. A guy from Bangladesh called AK Azad, who's promised to bring over a small show of his, and I'm sure that'll be fascinating. From my conversations with him, I'm really excited. We have some people coming over from the States, obviously. We have Vinnie Olivieri and Brad Berridge, who you may know. There's Joe Young from the UK, Nick Hunt and Rachel Nicholson from the UK. David Budris, hopefully, from the US. I hope I'm pronouncing this right. Olivero Grakanin from Serbia. Adrian Curtin, who's a sound design historian. He's going to come over and present some work. So there's some fantastic people coming over. The idea isn't really to talk about the technical aspects of what we do, but more about the art and the philosophy behind being a sound designer.", "segments": [{"start": 0.48, "end": 2.62, "text": "

audio-related stories. I'm curious where you find all these stories, Steve. Are they just things that you run across, you read in the newspaper? Are you following some other people that put out a lot of good articles? I follow a lot of people on Twitter, actually. I think Twitter's fantastic. I get most of my audio news off Twitter now. Or I use something called scoop.it where I store all this information. Which I do selfishly, really, because I think it's all going to be useful to me at some point. Hopefully it's useful to other people, too. Can you tell us some other good people to follow for audio-related things on Twitter? You know, everyone from someone like Martin Ware, who was a big sort of pop icon in the 70s in the UK with bands like Heaven 17 and Human League. Who's now a sound artist and involved in all sorts of other stuff. He's fascinating to follow. You know, Scanner is quite interesting, but he doesn't post very many links, but he's always quite lively. I mean, there's people like, there's a guy called Des Coulombe, who's an audio recordist out in, who lives, an Englishman who lives in Paris. And his posts are just fantastic. I mean, he just posts some wonderful ambient sounds from Paris that are just, you know, you can just lose yourself in completely. So tell me about your main gig at the Royal Exchange Theatre Company in Manchester. This is a large multi-room performance space, just from the photos that I saw online and the information on the website. So do you supervise a team of technicians there or do you design all of their shows? What are your responsibilities? Well, I'm head of sound for the Royal Exchange Theatre Company in Manchester. There's a team of four who I manage. A fantastically talented team of young sound designers, young technicians. I don't design all the shows there. I've designed probably near enough 100 shows there in my time. But we get a lot of guest sound designers now. And my job really is to supervise their work and use the experience I've got of the space. And it's an amazing theatre. It's a seven-sided theatre in the round. And it's worth looking up online to have a look at some pictures of it. Constructed completely out of steel and glass in the centre of Manchester. It actually sits in the old Cotton Exchange in Manchester city centre. And it looks a bit like a lunar module has landed in the middle of this very old room, which is arguably the largest room in the world. Three levels. It's a sound designer's dream in many ways. We can put sound above the audience, below the audience, inside the theatre or outside the theatre. It's about 400 tyre lines around the building. Wow. And we can put loudspeakers virtually anywhere to hopefully create a fully immersive surround sound experience for the audience. It's a challenging space to work in. It's not a place where you'd probably want to design a show if you're new to sound design. It's a place where you have to make a lot of very critical decisions very quickly. What would you say is the most challenging thing for the guest sound designers that are coming in, they're most surprised with? They say, oh, I have to decide this and that? It's the sheer number of loudspeakers you use, I think. We've got a large system. We can use anything between 70 and 120 loudspeakers. And for a drama show, that's actually quite a lot. You're doing a big musical. But for a check-off, that's a lot of loudspeakers. The system is a Maya system. We have 56 UPM ones, a load of MSL2s, UPAs, USWs. And we've also got a lot of control ones, which we use for surround sound. The biggest challenge for a sound designer coming in is really you need to have planned what you're going to do in quite a lot of detail before you start. Because we turn around shows quite quickly, if you're not clear about what you want to achieve, you can be going around in circles, literally. You can be going around in circles for hours and days, trying to get the effect you're after. What are some of your favorite parts about the space that make you really like to work there? Well, I think the most important thing about the space is that it's one that's really shared between the audience and the performer. I mean, the audience enter through the same, to the auditorium through the same doors the performers enter and exit in performance. So it really is a shared space. And no member of the audience is further than nine meters from the center of the stage. Wow. Which is phenomenal. It's a unique design. And it truly is a remarkable place to experience any theater. And as the sound designer, you can make the audience feel as if they're exactly in the room, next to the actor, which indeed they almost are. Or you can make them feel like a tiny grain of sand on a huge desert. So you can really use sound as a focusing tool in quite a unique way. I'm impressed that you're so active with professional organizations because I've been a member of the AES. Theater Bay Area. And I've tried contacting our local unions a few times, but I could never really see how it was benefiting. So I dropped most of my memberships. And I see that you're active with an international theatrical union. Could you talk a little bit about how the union, as well as other professional organizations, you're a part of affect your day-to-day work and the day-to-day work of other theater employees and contractors? And I don't know why people should be involved. The organizations, I'm involved with, I wouldn't ever really call them unions, which I see as organizations which campaign on behalf of employees for better working conditions. And I use to as a negotiating tool. For instance, OISTAP, which is the International Organization of Sonographers, Theater Architects and Technicians, has a sound design working group, which I lead. And really, our primary objective is to support and encourage professional relationships between sound designers internationally and encourage knowledge sharing and mentoring and also sharing a beer when we get together. On the rare occasions we all get together from various parts of the world. It really is an important organization for global communication, really, between sound designers. I mean, I've lots of friends who are sound designers in the United States, and friends, obviously, are sound designers in the United Kingdom. But since being part of the OISTAP sound design working group, I have sound designers who are acquaintances and friends in Bangladesh and India and Japan and the Philippines and all these amazing places where we don't really understand what they do and how they work. And they have a lot to offer in terms of techniques, ideas, attitudes, which we can all learn from. And what I'm trying to do and what I try to do and what the OISTAP sound design working group tries to do is pull all these people together and make really an international community of like-minded professionals. But our next in-person meeting will be at World Stage Design, which is happening in Cardiff next September, just about a year away from now, which is basically a theater design exhibition and there's a number of workshops and presentations and all sorts of things. And I've been busy organizing a number of events for next year's World Stage Design, which happens between September the 8th and September the 15th in Cardiff in Wales. And it's going to be at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, which is a fantastic, fantastic institution. And a brand new concert hall, which is amazing, and a brand new theater there, which we're using. They've given me the concert hall for a week to program various events, which is such a luxury. It's a fantastic honor as well. That sounds great. Well, tell me about one of the events that you're programming. I'll tell you who I've invited over, who I'm 80% sure these people will be part of the event. There's a sound designer and director from India called Dinesh Yadav, who's a fascinating musician, theater director, designer, sound designer, composer. An amazing guy from New Zealand called Daniel Belton, who's a dancer and sound designer, whose work you really need to check out on YouTube and Vimeo. There's a guy called Bassam, I'm hoping I'm pronouncing all these names correctly, by the way. Bassam Yakot from Egypt, who's a sound designer from Egypt, who's been doing some fantastic stuff out there. A guy from Bangladesh called AK Azad, who's promised to bring over a small show of his, and I'm sure that'll be fascinating. From my conversations with him, I'm really excited. We have some people coming over from the States, obviously. We have Vinnie Olivieri and Brad Berridge, who you may know. There's Joe Young from the UK, Nick Hunt and Rachel Nicholson from the UK. David Budris, hopefully, from the US. I hope I'm pronouncing this right. Olivero Grakanin from Serbia. Adrian Curtin, who's a sound design historian. He's going to come over and present some work. So there's some fantastic people coming over. The idea isn't really to talk about the technical aspects of what we do, but more about the art and the philosophy behind being a sound designer.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.48, "end": 2.62,
