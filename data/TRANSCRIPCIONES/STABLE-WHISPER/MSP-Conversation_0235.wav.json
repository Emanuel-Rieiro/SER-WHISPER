{"text": " Well, he approached me, yeah. We had a model in my school, and we were contesting. So, like, the teacher was the coach of it. So he took me for a rehearsal, and I was, like, the best. So he actually got jumped, I can say. And how did you feel about him approaching you? You're a student and he's a teacher. Every girl was talking about him. So I couldn't show myself I wanted him. But the thing that everyone was, like, talking about him and talking about him. He was just, like, a lotto ticket, you know. Yeah, so I won the lotto, but it wasn't a serious thing. Did you feel any sense of doubt when he approached you? It was second term in my school. So, like, it came about five student teachers. So among the five, I knew he was going to be the one approaching me. Did this affect the way you behaved in class? Well, it did. I was that student, you know, an A student. So it did, because sometimes I wouldn't attend lessons because of him. And if I passed the test, some students would think maybe I'm favored or something, but I'm just a buffin'. Tell me what your relationship was. How close were you? How physical did you get? Well, we were very close. And, like, it was something known to everyone in school. How far did you get in terms of being, you know, physically connected, intimate? Yeah, I'll echo that childish. Please don't touch me. Don't do this to me. Yeah, you know, that kind of stuff. But you wanted to? Yeah. You wanted to have sex with him? Not really. Not sex and such. Yeah. Now, when we look at the way, you know, other kids behaved around you, they knew about your relationship with the teacher. What was the talk around the subject of you being in love? Well, they were jealous, as I told you. But I won the modern competition. So it was like, I'm favored and stuff, but though I was going to win. Do you think it was fair on other kids that you were in love with the teacher? It wasn't really fair. Yeah, it wasn't. Did you notice any special treatment when you were in class? Yeah. When he came, it was that time of choosing school prefects and what, what, what. I wasn't supposed to be a prefect anyhow. But I was one because I felt favored. And if your parents found out that you were dating that teacher, how do you think they'd react? My dad was going to be mad. Yeah, seriously, I was going to be mad. Now, what's your message to school teachers pertaining to this issue of them approaching? Their students? I don't think it's appropriate for teachers to date school kids. I think they should hold their feelings and like approach the girl after they left the school and moved on to another school. Today, we're talking about romantic relationships between teachers and their students. You've just heard from Samantha, who has fond memories of a relationship with her teacher. But how do her age mates see it? Here's a discussion with a group of students from Mulawayo. As much as we would like to sugarcoat it, I know that the reality is that those things are really happening out there now. You might find that there's a student teacher and this is a very young person. Maybe he's 21, he's 22. And, you know, he's just trying to make his way in life. And then especially if he's teaching at high school, those mature girls, 19, 18. Obviously, they might date, right? And might blossom into something beautiful. They end up getting married. I know about this couple they met at high school. The guy was actually a teacher. But then the thing is, it's bad. Generally, there's a stereotype that teachers shouldn't date their students. It disturbs everything and all that. But then, I don't know. Get along just fine. And if no one is taking advantage of the situation. For example, if a girl is 19 and the teacher is 21, you know, they can relate. So, I don't know. There's two sides to the story. I think we have two teachers here. The very old teacher who is going to play. Yes, that one is the problem. And the one who's got potential. Maybe the guy is on his sim break and he wants to teach part-time, right? I think that's where we are here. We have two teachers. He's married, but he wants secret. Small house. No, he just wants to use you sexually. But there's this other one who is dating for a purpose. Maybe he's seeing future life in you. Do you talk about it as friends that I'm interested in that teacher or that teacher is interested in me? What kind of discussions happen during break, in between lessons, you know? Now, it depends on the company that you hang with. Some friends will tell you, you know, just take care of this person. Just going to mess you up. Then other girls will tell you, you might as well just do it. Let's just spend as many. All right. So, is it a secret? No, it's not a secret. Everyone will be knowing it, that's why he's dating a teacher. Myself, I was approached by a teacher and everyone knew it. And my opinion on this, I think a teacher must be a role model. It must be someone who molds you. And if the same teacher comes to you and say, let's go out, it's not good at all. Because school is not a dating zone. Your teacher is dating a classmate. How do you as classmates take it? It generally pisses me off. Because, like, that's like trying to take advantage of someone that's young. I don't think it should happen like that. Because if a teacher now starts quoting a student, that's kind of weird. I found that there was a guy who was actually after the chick. But then the chick would be saying, the teacher is much better. He's got money. The student doesn't have money. So, in this case, the student will lose out and then the teacher will win at the end of the day. But the problem is, you might take advantage of him being a teacher, abusing his powers on me, the guy. That's the bad part of it. How do the girls view that? There is some kind of animosity that will be created when I know there is a guy who's after me and there is a teacher who's after me. Generally, if I decide to date that chick, you know you're going to fail. You know things are not going to go your way. And you know there will be total disrespect in public by the teacher, just to prove a point. Does it embarrass you that you've been approached by a teacher where it actually raises your bar? It's embarrassing. Because you ask yourself, why? Why out of all the guys in the school, why a teacher? It depends. Sometimes, you know, when you're in high school, during your teenage years, it feels good to some people that you're being approached by someone older than you. You're being seen. It makes you feel better than all the other girls in school. And then, in most cases, it's not like he's older. Maybe there will be a two years, three years difference. And then you find that, out of school, he's actually a good person. But he's your teacher. Still, he's my teacher. But at the end of the day, there's boy and girl, woman and man, regardless of me being a student. It's not like we're going to show our affection in front of the class and we're going to do everything like that in front of the class. What kind of affection takes place in this relationship? Well, maybe... What sort of affection takes place? You know, the kind of, the holy affection. What you did yesterday or last night, does it not spill over when this teacher comes to teach you? It does. It does. As I see him standing in front of the class, I'm actually thinking about all the things that he was doing to me yesterday. All the fun that we were having. His eyes, his smile, the way he was touching me. I can't even hear what he's talking about. The only thing that I hear in my head is how much he loves me. Now I can't even hear what he's teaching. Okay. Wow. Okay, we just have to let that sink in. Okay. We know that this happens more on the girl's side. The girl is being approached by the male teachers. Don't you have female teachers who approach young boys or students? I had a friend who was dating a teacher. A guy. Okay, tell us more about that. Yeah, just go. To be honest, the teacher was good looking. So the guy, I don't know what got into him. He approached the teacher and then the teacher said she is. And then they started dating. But only a few people knew of it. The way they were doing it, you couldn't tell that they were dating. They could keep it on a low. When you look at this, when we compare this situation here, does the guy get respect? Does he feel, you know, embarrassed by the whole situation? What's the situation like comparatively? Let's talk about that. If a guy is to date a teacher, he's more or less on the advantage than I am. Even if we're both doing it for the same reason. I'm the immoral one. He's got respect for what he's doing. Do you think teachers are to blame for them approaching you as girls or as guys? Yeah, they have told that they mustn't date students. Yeah, and in some cases they take advantage of the student. Like I was saying, sometimes for girls, it may feel good that your teacher is asking you out. So they take advantage of that. They mustn't do that. They should just be our role model. Something like that. So what's your message to teachers as students? Stick to teaching. You should just learn to draw the line. You just have to focus on your work and leave the girls alone. Well, I can't say leave the girls alone. Both parties are to blame. Exactly. Especially, well, I could say the girls, you know, like things, you know, fast things, easy things. Teachers have more money than the students. So basically both parties are to blame and they should learn how to handle themselves. But most of the blame obviously goes towards the teachers because they are more mature, they are older, they benefit more in such situations. If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel, will you keep bringing out the best in me? You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo. You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo. Too good for me. Those were students from high schools in the city. To get a complete picture in this discussion on teachers and students dating, we need to hear the voice of a teacher. Bruce once worked as a temporary teacher and he says that sometimes it's the students that take the initiative. I got one later. Then we sat down with other guys. We decided what do we do with this lead. So we took that later, we kept it. I forwarded the letter to my HR team. Unfortunately, it was a man. He just took the letter, we discussed and I said, I know this girl has got potential at school. We can't even forward the letter because she might get expelled. So let's try and talk to her. Maybe she will understand. We did that. Yeah, and it worked. So the relationship between me and her after that, it was just as normal as a teacher and a student relationship. Let's be honest with each other, man to man now. How did you feel about this approach that this girl did? You're a man and you're bound to be attracted to a young lady who might be good looking or who might just be interesting. Now, how did you take this particular situation? It wasn't easy. I was like, okay, but I mean, why do I say, I know she's a student, but I evaluated the situation first. Okay. What if I get caught and stuff? What if, what if? Do you think that teachers or students are not being treated fairly if there should be such a rule that it is unethical for them to date each other when it's a teacher and a student? When it comes to the girl's situation, I don't think it's going to work because the teacher and the student have to be like a parent and a child. What are the others going to say? How will they feel? They'll say, ah, the student is getting so, so mugged because the teacher is. Do you think maybe it starts off from the way that you as a teacher treats the young girl? If you give her maybe the preferential treatment, like you do her some favors, mostly teachers would like to send children to her, go and buy me this, keep the change, go and do this for me. Yeah, maybe I'm going to pay you with this. Then that kind of thing, the relationship, it grows bigger and bigger. And sometimes send her to the cottages, go and do this for me, go and sweep my room. The next thing, the teacher will be there.", "segments": [{"start": 0.18, "end": 1.56, "text": " Well, he approached me, yeah.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [1042, 11, 415, 17247, 385, 11, 1338, 13],

We had a model in my school, and we were contesting. So, like, the teacher was the coach of it. So he took me for a rehearsal, and I was, like, the best. So he actually got jumped, I can say. And how did you feel about him approaching you? You're a student and he's a teacher. Every girl was talking about him. So I couldn't show myself I wanted him. But the thing that everyone was, like, talking about him and talking about him. He was just, like, a lotto ticket, you know. Yeah, so I won the lotto, but it wasn't a serious thing. Did you feel any sense of doubt when he approached you? It was second term in my school. So, like, it came about five student teachers. So among the five, I knew he was going to be the one approaching me. Did this affect the way you behaved in class? Well, it did. I was that student, you know, an A student. So it did, because sometimes I wouldn't attend lessons because of him. And if I passed the test, some students would think maybe I'm favored or something, but I'm just a buffin'. Tell me what your relationship was. How close were you? How physical did you get? Well, we were very close. And, like, it was something known to everyone in school. How far did you get in terms of being, you know, physically connected, intimate? Yeah, I'll echo that childish. Please don't touch me. Don't do this to me. Yeah, you know, that kind of stuff. But you wanted to? Yeah. You wanted to have sex with him? Not really. Not sex and such. Yeah. Now, when we look at the way, you know, other kids behaved around you, they knew about your relationship with the teacher. What was the talk around the subject of you being in love? Well, they were jealous, as I told you. But I won the modern competition. So it was like, I'm favored and stuff, but though I was going to win. Do you think it was fair on other kids that you were in love with the teacher? It wasn't really fair. Yeah, it wasn't. Did you notice any special treatment when you were in class? Yeah. When he came, it was that time of choosing school prefects and what, what, what. I wasn't supposed to be a prefect anyhow. But I was one because I felt favored. And if your parents found out that you were dating that teacher, how do you think they'd react? My dad was going to be mad. Yeah, seriously, I was going to be mad. Now, what's your message to school teachers pertaining to this issue of them approaching? Their students? I don't think it's appropriate for teachers to date school kids. I think they should hold their feelings and like approach the girl after they left the school and moved on to another school. Today, we're talking about romantic relationships between teachers and their students. You've just heard from Samantha, who has fond memories of a relationship with her teacher. But how do her age mates see it? Here's a discussion with a group of students from Mulawayo. As much as we would like to sugarcoat it, I know that the reality is that those things are really happening out there now. You might find that there's a student teacher and this is a very young person. Maybe he's 21, he's 22. And, you know, he's just trying to make his way in life. And then especially if he's teaching at high school, those mature girls, 19, 18. Obviously, they might date, right? And might blossom into something beautiful. They end up getting married. I know about this couple they met at high school. The guy was actually a teacher. But then the thing is, it's bad. Generally, there's a stereotype that teachers shouldn't date their students. It disturbs everything and all that. But then, I don't know. Get along just fine. And if no one is taking advantage of the situation. For example, if a girl is 19 and the teacher is 21, you know, they can relate. So, I don't know. There's two sides to the story. I think we have two teachers here. The very old teacher who is going to play. Yes, that one is the problem. And the one who's got potential. Maybe the guy is on his sim break and he wants to teach part-time, right? I think that's where we are here. We have two teachers. He's married, but he wants secret. Small house. No, he just wants to use you sexually. But there's this other one who is dating for a purpose. Maybe he's seeing future life in you. Do you talk about it as friends that I'm interested in that teacher or that teacher is interested in me? What kind of discussions happen during break, in between lessons, you know? Now, it depends on the company that you hang with. Some friends will tell you, you know, just take care of this person. Just going to mess you up. Then other girls will tell you, you might as well just do it. Let's just spend as many. All right. So, is it a secret? No, it's not a secret. Everyone will be knowing it, that's why he's dating a teacher. Myself, I was approached by a teacher and everyone knew it. And my opinion on this, I think a teacher must be a role model. It must be someone who molds you. And if the same teacher comes to you and say, let's go out, it's not good at all. Because school is not a dating zone. Your teacher is dating a classmate. How do you as classmates take it? It generally pisses me off. Because, like, that's like trying to take advantage of someone that's young. I don't think it should happen like that. Because if a teacher now starts quoting a student, that's kind of weird. I found that there was a guy who was actually after the chick. But then the chick would be saying, the teacher is much better. He's got money. The student doesn't have money. So, in this case, the student will lose out and then the teacher will win at the end of the day. But the problem is, you might take advantage of him being a teacher, abusing his powers on me, the guy. That's the bad part of it. How do the girls view that? There is some kind of animosity that will be created when I know there is a guy who's after me and there is a teacher who's after me. Generally, if I decide to date that chick, you know you're going to fail. You know things are not going to go your way. And you know there will be total disrespect in public by the teacher, just to prove a point. Does it embarrass you that you've been approached by a teacher where it actually raises your bar? It's embarrassing. Because you ask yourself, why? Why out of all the guys in the school, why a teacher? It depends. Sometimes, you know, when you're in high school, during your teenage years, it feels good to some people that you're being approached by someone older than you. You're being seen. It makes you feel better than all the other girls in school. And then, in most cases, it's not like he's older. Maybe there will be a two years, three years difference. And then you find that, out of school, he's actually a good person. But he's your teacher. Still, he's my teacher. But at the end of the day, there's boy and girl, woman and man, regardless of me being a student. It's not like we're going to show our affection in front of the class and we're going to do everything like that in front of the class. What kind of affection takes place in this relationship? Well, maybe... What sort of affection takes place? You know, the kind of, the holy affection. What you did yesterday or last night, does it not spill over when this teacher comes to teach you? It does. It does. As I see him standing in front of the class, I'm actually thinking about all the things that he was doing to me yesterday. All the fun that we were having. His eyes, his smile, the way he was touching me. I can't even hear what he's talking about. The only thing that I hear in my head is how much he loves me. Now I can't even hear what he's teaching. Okay. Wow. Okay, we just have to let that sink in. Okay. We know that this happens more on the girl's side. The girl is being approached by the male teachers. Don't you have female teachers who approach young boys or students? I had a friend who was dating a teacher. A guy. Okay, tell us more about that. Yeah, just go. To be honest, the teacher was good looking. So the guy, I don't know what got into him. He approached the teacher and then the teacher said she is. And then they started dating. But only a few people knew of it. The way they were doing it, you couldn't tell that they were dating. They could keep it on a low. When you look at this, when we compare this situation here, does the guy get respect? Does he feel, you know, embarrassed by the whole situation? What's the situation like comparatively? Let's talk about that. If a guy is to date a teacher, he's more or less on the advantage than I am. Even if we're both doing it for the same reason. I'm the immoral one. He's got respect for what he's doing. Do you think teachers are to blame for them approaching you as girls or as guys? Yeah, they have told that they mustn't date students. Yeah, and in some cases they take advantage of the student. Like I was saying, sometimes for girls, it may feel good that your teacher is asking you out. So they take advantage of that. They mustn't do that. They should just be our role model. Something like that. So what's your message to teachers as students? Stick to teaching. You should just learn to draw the line. You just have to focus on your work and leave the girls alone. Well, I can't say leave the girls alone. Both parties are to blame. Exactly. Especially, well, I could say the girls, you know, like things, you know, fast things, easy things. Teachers have more money than the students. So basically both parties are to blame and they should learn how to handle themselves. But most of the blame obviously goes towards the teachers because they are more mature, they are older, they benefit more in such situations. If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel, will you keep bringing out the best in me? You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo. You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo. Too good for me. Those were students from high schools in the city. To get a complete picture in this discussion on teachers and students dating, we need to hear the voice of a teacher. Bruce once worked as a temporary teacher and he says that sometimes it's the students that take the initiative. I got one later. Then we sat down with other guys. We decided what do we do with this lead. So we took that later, we kept it. I forwarded the letter to my HR team. Unfortunately, it was a man. He just took the letter, we discussed and I said, I know this girl has got potential at school. We can't even forward the letter because she might get expelled. So let's try and talk to her. Maybe she will understand. We did that. Yeah, and it worked. So the relationship between me and her after that, it was just as normal as a teacher and a student relationship. Let's be honest with each other, man to man now. How did you feel about this approach that this girl did? You're a man and you're bound to be attracted to a young lady who might be good looking or who might just be interesting. Now, how did you take this particular situation? It wasn't easy. I was like, okay, but I mean, why do I say, I know she's a student, but I evaluated the situation first. Okay. What if I get caught and stuff? What if, what if? Do you think that teachers or students are not being treated fairly if there should be such a rule that it is unethical for them to date each other when it's a teacher and a student? When it comes to the girl's situation, I don't think it's going to work because the teacher and the student have to be like a parent and a child. What are the others going to say? How will they feel? They'll say, ah, the student is getting so, so mugged because the teacher is. Do you think maybe it starts off from the way that you as a teacher treats the young girl? If you give her maybe the preferential treatment, like you do her some favors, mostly teachers would like to send children to her, go and buy me this, keep the change, go and do this for me. Yeah, maybe I'm going to pay you with this. Then that kind of thing, the relationship, it grows bigger and bigger. And sometimes send her to the cottages, go and do this for me, go and sweep my room. The next thing, the teacher will be there.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.18, "end": 1.56, "text": " Well, he approached me, yeah.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [1042, 11, 415, 17247, 385, 11, 1338,
