{"text": " It's this movie that I believe is on Netflix. And I know I mentioned it to you before once. It's actually a LGBT movie. And I thought the plot was interesting. And the way that they handle kind of hard topics, I guess, was really nice. Like, it is a comedy, but they don't make a comedy about, like, the serious things. What is it? It's called Alex Strangelove. Oh, okay. I haven't seen that. Yeah, and I don't know what it was. It's like I heard about it. And then I just got bored and I saw it on Netflix. And I was like, okay, I'm going to check this out. And it's essentially about a guy, Alex, and he's a high schooler. I mean, it's a high schooler coming of age story. And, like, it starts out and it's like he meets this girl in class. And they become best friends because they like all the same stuff. And then they've been friends for, like, four years. So they end up dating once they get to, like, senior year of high school and stuff. You know, it's just kind of, like, basic everyday high school dude, right? And kind of as it goes along, like, he meets this guy. And then he starts to realize that, like, he has feelings for this guy. And then he gets really confused because it's like, because the story is like, well, you know, I really, I really love this girl. Like, she's my best friend. And I really do care about her and love her. But the girl is ready to, like, you know, sleep with him. And he's, like, not really enthusiastic about it. But he's confused about it. He's like, why wouldn't I be? Because I love her and all this stuff. And it's just... He sort of realizes that he, like, stumbled into the relationship because that's how it works with the series of events, not because... Yeah. Yeah. He was just like, oh, well, we're, like, 17 now. So I guess we should start dating. But it's like, he really does care for the girlfriend character. But it's just, it's a different kind of love, I guess. And it's just, it's really interesting. And it has, like, a happy ending and all. But it's, like, you know, like, they have real arguments that make sense. And it's, again, it's, like, it is a comedy. But they don't, it's not, like, there's not, like, haha gay jokes or anything in it. Because it's just, it's a very, it seems like a very honest movie of just, like, just different kinds of love. Like, romantic love and friendship love. And it's just, I was like, oh, this is such a sweet movie. Like, I didn't expect it. And it was just, it was, it was very good. And I definitely recommend it. Cool. Yeah. I definitely want to, like, check that out. Because I like, I like that more movies can have, or rather, I don't know. I guess I hope that more movies can kind of take that step to be, to show that there are different kinds of love and different, like, levels of that. I'm watching this Netflix series right now called Sex Education. It has Gillian Anderson in it. And it's about, like, teens in high school. And it's wildly dramatized and funny. But I think it's really well written and has, like, pretty colors and stuff. One of the main characters is, like, freaked out because he does not really have a sex drive. And he's like, what's wrong with me? And he's, like, 17 or 16 or whatever. And the whole time I'm watching it, I'm kind of like, my dude, you're asexual. Like, I think you're ace. But I don't, but the problem is that I don't think the movie, I don't think the show is going to go in that direction. Because he ends up meeting a girl who he likes. And then he kind of, like, has, like, sexual feelings for. And he's like, oh, this is it. But I'm like, I want to see more representations of queerness and things that people, like, that it's not, like, rather teens coming to realize, like, hey, I don't have to conform to this, like, step-by-step process of, like, how to be a teen and, like, life. Like, have a crush. Go on dates. Like, start dating. Like, and, like, I have to, like, I don't know, be in a relationship with someone by this age or et cetera, et cetera. Having that unsureness and people realizing that, hey, I don't maybe want this and that's okay. And I want to explore other things that I might want. I like that. I hope that more movies and shows have that kind of narrative in it. And I'm glad that you really liked that movie because I want to check it out. I was a little anxious about it. It's very good. It's, like, I can't recommend it enough. After I watched it, I just had so many, like, fuzzy feelings for these little teenagers, you know, figuring things out. And it's all very natural. Like, I feel like the actor, the main character, like, he has chemistry with both, like, the girlfriend and also this guy that he meets. And it's just, it's all very natural. And he doesn't, like, I mean, he's, like, awkward or whatever. He doesn't look, you know, stereotypically gay or something. And it's just something that, like, just kind of blossoms naturally over the movie. And I'm like, this is nice. I like that it kind of, from what you're telling me, it sounds like he's, it's ambiguous, but in a way that it's, like, he's trying to figure it out. Like, he doesn't have to be gay or straight or, like, explicitly bi. He's just, like, this is me and I'm figuring out what I, like, want. Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, it just essentially is, like, you know, he started dating this girl that he was best friends with and did, like, I feel like, I think they had, like, a YouTube channel or something in the beginning of their friendship and all this stuff. And it was just, like, they were hanging out every day. And it's, like, he obviously cared for her a lot. And it just ended up that, like, it wasn't, like, he didn't sexually, wasn't sexually attracted to her, but he still, like, loved her in a different way. And I think it's just important to see that, especially, like, in high school. It's, like, you can, you can love people in different ways. It's, it was, ah, so good. I love how modern that is with that they, like, they had a YouTube channel. I'm, like, wow. Yeah. That, like, that just pinpoints, like, ages the movie, like, so perfectly in its time. I just, it's so funny. But, like, it's very cool to see more exploration and, I don't know, just more, like, a variety of stories in new rom-com stuff rather than the mainstream things that we had in the 80s, 90s. 2000s. It's, like, I really like those movies that I grew up with, but I'm also, like, they're all very similar. A lot of, a lot of those are the same stuff, which is, I like some of that stuff. So, I'm, like, hey, fun. But, hey, there's way more other things out there that we could be focusing on or, like, exploring in. Yeah. Romance genre. That actually kind of leads me into my next answer of my favorite, like, 80s, 90s movie. Yeah, that was my intent. Yes. So, I mean, I was born in the late 80s. I don't really remember the 80s, but I do have a fondness for 80s movies and 80s pop culture and stuff because 80s movies, especially, like, teen movies and coming-of-age movies, it's slightly familiar to me and yet still very foreign because I wasn't a teenager in the 80s. Yeah. But, like, I remember a lot of, like, the remnants of the 80s and the early 90s and stuff. The problem is, is that as I got older, a lot of movies just do not age very well. Mostly, what I'm thinking of is, I love John Hughes movies, but they, yeah, they're, like, yeah, they're classics. And then you watch them again, you're, like, mmm. Oh, my gosh. That, yeah. Molly Ringwald, actually. Yes. The actress who is in, she's the redhead in Breakfast Club and a lot of his other movies. Yeah. She wrote an article recently, maybe a handful of months ago, about how she is now a mother and she actually is also still acting, which is very cool. It's fun to see her in different shows. But she wrote an article about how... She is on Riverdale. Yeah. Oh, she's the mom. It's wonderful. She is a mother of, like, I think a preteen right now. And she wrote an article about how... about how she came to terms with the idea that her child might see the Breakfast Club now and how she would want them to see it and how it's very different. So, especially in, like, the Me Too era, there is this one scene where she's, like, sitting at her desk and I guess the teacher comes in, I can't quite remember, but the bad boy that she ends up, like, ending up with is underneath the table hiding and he, like, she's wearing a skirt and he, like, sticks his face, like, in between his legs and, like, there's, like, a panty shot and it's very... something that would be extremely, like, gross and wrong now and also, like, is looking back at it. Yeah. So, specifically, like, talking about that scene, she wrote an article about it and how it's just the perspective, like, the optics of it have maybe not shifted but definitely, like, come into focus. Yeah. So, it's just, like, some things just do not age well and it's important to be able to take that with a grain of salt. And, like, especially when those movies are so idealized. Yeah, it's, like, I still have a lot of fondness for a lot of those movies. Like, if you just take away all the not-so-good moments, like, there are moments that I still love about it and, like, classic things about it but, like, I can still acknowledge, like, hey, those movies aren't as great as I remember them because they were actually a mess. But, I do have one movie that is from the 80s that I don't remember really any properly and I saw it pretty recently and it's kind of the same way that I like Alex Strangelove and that it's very, it's just, it feels very real. It doesn't feel like the characters are tropes or anything or it's very 80s or anything and it's the movie Say Anything which is, a lot of people remember it as the movie with the scene where the guy has the boombox. Yeah, I almost said that. I almost said, hey, yeah, the boombox movie. Yes, but no, that, because, like, I'd always known about that moment and I never actually knew the movie behind it and so I watched it and, because you see that and you think, like, oh, the guy, like, totally screwed up and she dumped him and now he's trying to get her back or whatever and it's actually not like that at all. I mean, it's, it's kind of a typical, oh, he's kind of a, like, he's not a loser but he's kind of an underachiever and she's, like, the valedictorian and she's, like, super smart and going to, like, going abroad to college or something and she's very ambitious and all that stuff but they're both very awkward teenagers and so, like, their little romance that they have is very sweet and very, just very cute because, like, she's one of those characters where she's very beautiful but she's not but, no, she's very shy because, like, guys don't really talk to her and stuff and, and he finally, like, kind of starts talking to her and it's very cute but it's, it's, the main obstacle is, like, her dad or whatever. Her dad's, like, you don't have time for a boyfriend. You have all these, like, things you have to do for college and all this stuff and so, like, they kind of break up or whatever because she feels pressured that she just doesn't have time for a boyfriend and all this stuff and so that's why he started playing that song outside of her bedroom and it's just, it's very sweet and, like, he's, there's no, there's never a moment where, like, he does anything that's super creepy or, like, a jerk or anything and I was, like, oh, finally, like, I don't have to feel bad rooting for him because he does something horrible. There are so many male leads in, like, mainstream rom-coms that are just assholes or just, like, I'm, like, why am I supposed to like this person at all? So, actually, the other night I watched P.S. I Love You, which, I like Gerard Butler all right, so I was, like, oh, this is on Netflix, I'll watch it. It does not age super well. Some of it is good but, like, like, very quickly there was, like, a transphobic joke in the beginning of it or rather it's, like, it's, like, I'm just, like, I'm uncomfortable and then one of the characters that she's, like, maybe gonna end up with is just, just, like, jerk who's just, like, he's, like, rude and there's just, like, some mental health things that I'm, like, okay, side eyes. It's a lot anyway but I'm, like, why, why are these, like, men, I, like, I don't like them. They're not even nice. They're just, like, smarmy and it's, it's very upsetting and, like, while I am kind of, like, okay, how typical the, like, valedictorian versus loser boy, like, it's never, like, the loser girl and the valedictorian boy, typically because it's either it's, like, the jock and the, like, shy awkward girl but she's actually, like, hot on the air. Anyway, rom-coms are littered with tons of, like, cliches that are not often very good but you can still, like, like some of those stories if they're done well, like, two cute awkward kids. I haven't seen Say Anything but after hearing you talk about it, I'm, like, maybe I wanna, I wanna watch it. Yeah, and it's not very long. It's a pretty short little movie and I just remember, like, whenever they would have, you know, arguments or whatever to create the conflict of the plot, um, they were very understandable arguments. Like, nobody really came off as a jerk. It was just kind of, like, awkward situations and teenagers and I was, like, okay, this, like, I understand both sides to this. So it just felt like a very, yeah, and it just felt like a very real relationship and it was just really nice and I just, I mean, I, like I said, it's been a few years but I just distinctly remember watching it and being, like, oh, I don't feel so grimy watching this as I do if I watch, you know, Sixteen Candles again which I really can't watch anymore because it's just, it's too bad. I actually, God, okay, you mentioned that, like, set me back in time. I had never seen it in my youth but I watched it with one of my great old, uh, like, babysitters who is very close to my age. She's only about eight years older than me or so but, um, I remember watching it in high school because it was one of her favorites growing up and we watched it and we were just, like, oh, boy, that doesn't age well at all and there are also some really gross scenes and I'm just, like, what the fuck? There was also, like, nudity at some point and I'm, like, oh, my God, I remember being shocked because I was in high school and also, like, these people are supposed to be high schoolers. I think it's, like, the girls in the locker room or something and they're showering and I'm just, like, what the fuck? Right? And I'm, like, these are supposed to be underage girls also. Anyway, it's just a whole smorgasbord of, of, of mess. Yeah, I mean, like, like I said, I love, I love the 80s. I have a very soft spot for it but they definitely had a different sense of humor and entertainment. It just doesn't, doesn't work anymore. A sense of what was okay and what was, like, not too far which is now it's just, like, optics, perspective, like, anyway. But I, I, I think that Say Anything is, is fantastic and not problematic and that, that song In Your Eyes is a very sweet song and I'm just, like, oh. Is it In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel? Yep. I love that song. Yep, that is the, that is the song but it's just that, that, um, that boombox moment is, like, it's very iconic for a reason. Like, it's a very, I don't know, my heart swelled when it happened. I was just, like, oh. Wait, that's, the song that he plays on the boombox? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. Wow. Uh, Sara Bareilles does a really great cover of it. It's on her, like, Love Song Stripped album. It's incredible. I love, I heard that song first through her cover and then. It's, it's a very good song, okay? Mm-hmm. It's very good. It's a good song. So, and, and I think I had to, like, rent it off of Amazon or something so I don't know where you can watch it but it, I highly recommend it. It's, like I said, it's very short. It's only, like, an hour and a half, I think. And it's just, I don't know, it's just, it's good. It's my favorite. 80s movie, no. Yeah, I'm also kind of a sucker for, like, first love stories. Yeah. I'm like, this is cute. This is so stupid. It'll know any better. I think that actually is a bit of a segue into, um, what I wanted to bring up with anime and manga romances. Mm-hmm. Because I love, like, the sweet, soft, like, first love genre. Mm-hmm. I was trying to figure out what my favorite romances in anime and manga were. And with manga, I had a lot of different lists of them. With anime, it was a little easier but I'll go into manga first. I used to read a lot of slice of life, um, manga. Oh, yeah. Uh, like, just a ton and starting with, like, okay, I believe in the past I considered Peach Girl a slice of life but really it's a soap opera. I was thinking about that the other day. I was like, what manga? What did I read? I'm so glad. I just read a lot of Peach Girl. For our listeners, um, I owned every single volume of Peach Girl, um, which is a very great soap opera manga. It maybe doesn't age super well. There are some things that are, like, there's one, like, It's not too bad. Yeah, but I'm thinking particularly of this, the mean girl character who, they're kind of friends but the mean girl Oh, yeah, she's the worst. Yes, he, like, sets up She is mentally unstable. Uh, she sets up, like, non-con, uh, I'm just gonna say, like, rape attempts for the main character that don't happen but it's, like, she set them up, like, she sent a gigolo to her house. Anyway, it's, like, a whole thing and it's, like, or gigolo. I think that was the first time I read that word, gigolo. Yeah. It was in that manga. Anyway. Gigolo. Yeah, thinking about it more, I'm just, like, this doesn't age super well but the art is pretty and I like the main character a lot. Momo, she's good. Anyway, I read, I had all of the books and I read the Change of Heart, like, um, spinoff first and then I went back and read the first volume and then I had Peach Girl say a story. Anyway, I owned all of them and then when I was cleaning out my room for my move, I had all these books and I didn't want to sell these ones because Peach Girl meant a lot to me when I was younger and reading all of it. So I gave them all the peony and now they have a good home at the place. Yeah, they're right next to me. I'm so glad. I, I, I have a, like, a random skinny bookcase. Oh, perfect. And they, they've just taken up, like, three-fourths of it. It's very good. They're Tokyo Pop, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So those are, like, super rare. Just, I'm very happy they have a place and they are not just, like, in a dumpster fire somewhere. Oh, no. No, they are mine. They are all mine and you can borrow them whenever you want. The best home. Thank you. We can just co-share them. Yes. I love, I love Peach Girl a lot. But that being said, it's not really a romance. It, because it's, like, ooh, it, it, it's a love triangle but it's not, like, a romance, really. It's just, it's just a soap opera drama. But my favorite romance of manga were more of, like, the actual slice of life things. So first, like, first that came to mind was Honey and Clover, which doesn't focus so much on the romance of it. I don't know if you've read it or watched it, but it's also an anime. It has two scenes of anime and then it has a live-action movie. And the live-action movie is really good. It, cuts off, like, it ends kind of in the middle of the manga series. But if you read the whole series all the way through, I think it has a really satisfying ending that also kind of mentions, like, it, it finally answers the question of why is it called Honey and Clover? That's revealed in literally the last or second to last chapter.

And I know I mentioned it to you before once. It's actually a LGBT movie. And I thought the plot was interesting. And the way that they handle kind of hard topics, I guess, was really nice. Like, it is a comedy, but they don't make a comedy about, like, the serious things. What is it? It's called Alex Strangelove. Oh, okay. I haven't seen that. Yeah, and I don't know what it was. It's like I heard about it. And then I just got bored and I saw it on Netflix. And I was like, okay, I'm going to check this out. And it's essentially about a guy, Alex, and he's a high schooler. I mean, it's a high schooler coming of age story. And, like, it starts out and it's like he meets this girl in class. And they become best friends because they like all the same stuff. And then they've been friends for, like, four years. So they end up dating once they get to, like, senior year of high school and stuff. You know, it's just kind of, like, basic everyday high school dude, right? And kind of as it goes along, like, he meets this guy. And then he starts to realize that, like, he has feelings for this guy. And then he gets really confused because it's like, because the story is like, well, you know, I really, I really love this girl. Like, she's my best friend. And I really do care about her and love her. But the girl is ready to, like, you know, sleep with him. And he's, like, not really enthusiastic about it. But he's confused about it. He's like, why wouldn't I be? Because I love her and all this stuff. And it's just... He sort of realizes that he, like, stumbled into the relationship because that's how it works with the series of events, not because... Yeah. Yeah. He was just like, oh, well, we're, like, 17 now. So I guess we should start dating. But it's like, he really does care for the girlfriend character. But it's just, it's a different kind of love, I guess. And it's just, it's really interesting. And it has, like, a happy ending and all. But it's, like, you know, like, they have real arguments that make sense. And it's, again, it's, like, it is a comedy. But they don't, it's not, like, there's not, like, haha gay jokes or anything in it. Because it's just, it's a very, it seems like a very honest movie of just, like, just different kinds of love. Like, romantic love and friendship love. And it's just, I was like, oh, this is such a sweet movie. Like, I didn't expect it. And it was just, it was, it was very good. And I definitely recommend it. Cool. Yeah. I definitely want to, like, check that out. Because I like, I like that more movies can have, or rather, I don't know. I guess I hope that more movies can kind of take that step to be, to show that there are different kinds of love and different, like, levels of that. I'm watching this Netflix series right now called Sex Education. It has Gillian Anderson in it. And it's about, like, teens in high school. And it's wildly dramatized and funny. But I think it's really well written and has, like, pretty colors and stuff. One of the main characters is, like, freaked out because he does not really have a sex drive. And he's like, what's wrong with me? And he's, like, 17 or 16 or whatever. And the whole time I'm watching it, I'm kind of like, my dude, you're asexual. Like, I think you're ace. But I don't, but the problem is that I don't think the movie, I don't think the show is going to go in that direction. Because he ends up meeting a girl who he likes. And then he kind of, like, has, like, sexual feelings for. And he's like, oh, this is it. But I'm like, I want to see more representations of queerness and things that people, like, that it's not, like, rather teens coming to realize, like, hey, I don't have to conform to this, like, step-by-step process of, like, how to be a teen and, like, life. Like, have a crush. Go on dates. Like, start dating. Like, and, like, I have to, like, I don't know, be in a relationship with someone by this age or et cetera, et cetera. Having that unsureness and people realizing that, hey, I don't maybe want this and that's okay. And I want to explore other things that I might want. I like that. I hope that more movies and shows have that kind of narrative in it. And I'm glad that you really liked that movie because I want to check it out. I was a little anxious about it. It's very good. It's, like, I can't recommend it enough. After I watched it, I just had so many, like, fuzzy feelings for these little teenagers, you know, figuring things out. And it's all very natural. Like, I feel like the actor, the main character, like, he has chemistry with both, like, the girlfriend and also this guy that he meets. And it's just, it's all very natural. And he doesn't, like, I mean, he's, like, awkward or whatever. He doesn't look, you know, stereotypically gay or something. And it's just something that, like, just kind of blossoms naturally over the movie. And I'm like, this is nice. I like that it kind of, from what you're telling me, it sounds like he's, it's ambiguous, but in a way that it's, like, he's trying to figure it out. Like, he doesn't have to be gay or straight or, like, explicitly bi. He's just, like, this is me and I'm figuring out what I, like, want. Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, it just essentially is, like, you know, he started dating this girl that he was best friends with and did, like, I feel like, I think they had, like, a YouTube channel or something in the beginning of their friendship and all this stuff. And it was just, like, they were hanging out every day. And it's, like, he obviously cared for her a lot. And it just ended up that, like, it wasn't, like, he didn't sexually, wasn't sexually attracted to her, but he still, like, loved her in a different way. And I think it's just important to see that, especially, like, in high school. It's, like, you can, you can love people in different ways. It's, it was, ah, so good. I love how modern that is with that they, like, they had a YouTube channel. I'm, like, wow. Yeah. That, like, that just pinpoints, like, ages the movie, like, so perfectly in its time. I just, it's so funny. But, like, it's very cool to see more exploration and, I don't know, just more, like, a variety of stories in new rom-com stuff rather than the mainstream things that we had in the 80s, 90s. 2000s. It's, like, I really like those movies that I grew up with, but I'm also, like, they're all very similar. A lot of, a lot of those are the same stuff, which is, I like some of that stuff. So, I'm, like, hey, fun. But, hey, there's way more other things out there that we could be focusing on or, like, exploring in. Yeah. Romance genre. That actually kind of leads me into my next answer of my favorite, like, 80s, 90s movie. Yeah, that was my intent. Yes. So, I mean, I was born in the late 80s. I don't really remember the 80s, but I do have a fondness for 80s movies and 80s pop culture and stuff because 80s movies, especially, like, teen movies and coming-of-age movies, it's slightly familiar to me and yet still very foreign because I wasn't a teenager in the 80s. Yeah. But, like, I remember a lot of, like, the remnants of the 80s and the early 90s and stuff. The problem is, is that as I got older, a lot of movies just do not age very well. Mostly, what I'm thinking of is, I love John Hughes movies, but they, yeah, they're, like, yeah, they're classics. And then you watch them again, you're, like, mmm. Oh, my gosh. That, yeah. Molly Ringwald, actually. Yes. The actress who is in, she's the redhead in Breakfast Club and a lot of his other movies. Yeah. She wrote an article recently, maybe a handful of months ago, about how she is now a mother and she actually is also still acting, which is very cool. It's fun to see her in different shows. But she wrote an article about how... She is on Riverdale. Yeah. Oh, she's the mom. It's wonderful. She is a mother of, like, I think a preteen right now. And she wrote an article about how... about how she came to terms with the idea that her child might see the Breakfast Club now and how she would want them to see it and how it's very different. So, especially in, like, the Me Too era, there is this one scene where she's, like, sitting at her desk and I guess the teacher comes in, I can't quite remember, but the bad boy that she ends up, like, ending up with is underneath the table hiding and he, like, she's wearing a skirt and he, like, sticks his face, like, in between his legs and, like, there's, like, a panty shot and it's very... something that would be extremely, like, gross and wrong now and also, like, is looking back at it. Yeah. So, specifically, like, talking about that scene, she wrote an article about it and how it's just the perspective, like, the optics of it have maybe not shifted but definitely, like, come into focus. Yeah. So, it's just, like, some things just do not age well and it's important to be able to take that with a grain of salt. And, like, especially when those movies are so idealized. Yeah, it's, like, I still have a lot of fondness for a lot of those movies. Like, if you just take away all the not-so-good moments, like, there are moments that I still love about it and, like, classic things about it but, like, I can still acknowledge, like, hey, those movies aren't as great as I remember them because they were actually a mess. But, I do have one movie that is from the 80s that I don't remember really any properly and I saw it pretty recently and it's kind of the same way that I like Alex Strangelove and that it's very, it's just, it feels very real. It doesn't feel like the characters are tropes or anything or it's very 80s or anything and it's the movie Say Anything which is, a lot of people remember it as the movie with the scene where the guy has the boombox. Yeah, I almost said that. I almost said, hey, yeah, the boombox movie. Yes, but no, that, because, like, I'd always known about that moment and I never actually knew the movie behind it and so I watched it and, because you see that and you think, like, oh, the guy, like, totally screwed up and she dumped him and now he's trying to get her back or whatever and it's actually not like that at all. I mean, it's, it's kind of a typical, oh, he's kind of a, like, he's not a loser but he's kind of an underachiever and she's, like, the valedictorian and she's, like, super smart and going to, like, going abroad to college or something and she's very ambitious and all that stuff but they're both very awkward teenagers and so, like, their little romance that they have is very sweet and very, just very cute because, like, she's one of those characters where she's very beautiful but she's not but, no, she's very shy because, like, guys don't really talk to her and stuff and, and he finally, like, kind of starts talking to her and it's very cute but it's, it's, the main obstacle is, like, her dad or whatever. Her dad's, like, you don't have time for a boyfriend. You have all these, like, things you have to do for college and all this stuff and so, like, they kind of break up or whatever because she feels pressured that she just doesn't have time for a boyfriend and all this stuff and so that's why he started playing that song outside of her bedroom and it's just, it's very sweet and, like, he's, there's no, there's never a moment where, like, he does anything that's super creepy or, like, a jerk or anything and I was, like, oh, finally, like, I don't have to feel bad rooting for him because he does something horrible. There are so many male leads in, like, mainstream rom-coms that are just assholes or just, like, I'm, like, why am I supposed to like this person at all? So, actually, the other night I watched P.S. I Love You, which, I like Gerard Butler all right, so I was, like, oh, this is on Netflix, I'll watch it. It does not age super well. Some of it is good but, like, like, very quickly there was, like, a transphobic joke in the beginning of it or rather it's, like, it's, like, I'm just, like, I'm uncomfortable and then one of the characters that she's, like, maybe gonna end up with is just, just, like, jerk who's just, like, he's, like, rude and there's just, like, some mental health things that I'm, like, okay, side eyes. It's a lot anyway but I'm, like, why, why are these, like, men, I, like, I don't like them. They're not even nice. They're just, like, smarmy and it's, it's very upsetting and, like, while I am kind of, like, okay, how typical the, like, valedictorian versus loser boy, like, it's never, like, the loser girl and the valedictorian boy, typically because it's either it's, like, the jock and the, like, shy awkward girl but she's actually, like, hot on the air. Anyway, rom-coms are littered with tons of, like, cliches that are not often very good but you can still, like, like some of those stories if they're done well, like, two cute awkward kids. I haven't seen Say Anything but after hearing you talk about it, I'm, like, maybe I wanna, I wanna watch it. Yeah, and it's not very long. It's a pretty short little movie and I just remember, like, whenever they would have, you know, arguments or whatever to create the conflict of the plot, um, they were very understandable arguments. Like, nobody really came off as a jerk. It was just kind of, like, awkward situations and teenagers and I was, like, okay, this, like, I understand both sides to this. So it just felt like a very, yeah, and it just felt like a very real relationship and it was just really nice and I just, I mean, I, like I said, it's been a few years but I just distinctly remember watching it and being, like, oh, I don't feel so grimy watching this as I do if I watch, you know, Sixteen Candles again which I really can't watch anymore because it's just, it's too bad. I actually, God, okay, you mentioned that, like, set me back in time. I had never seen it in my youth but I watched it with one of my great old, uh, like, babysitters who is very close to my age. She's only about eight years older than me or so but, um, I remember watching it in high school because it was one of her favorites growing up and we watched it and we were just, like, oh, boy, that doesn't age well at all and there are also some really gross scenes and I'm just, like, what the fuck? There was also, like, nudity at some point and I'm, like, oh, my God, I remember being shocked because I was in high school and also, like, these people are supposed to be high schoolers. I think it's, like, the girls in the locker room or something and they're showering and I'm just, like, what the fuck? Right? And I'm, like, these are supposed to be underage girls also. Anyway, it's just a whole smorgasbord of, of, of mess. Yeah, I mean, like, like I said, I love, I love the 80s. I have a very soft spot for it but they definitely had a different sense of humor and entertainment. It just doesn't, doesn't work anymore. A sense of what was okay and what was, like, not too far which is now it's just, like, optics, perspective, like, anyway. But I, I, I think that Say Anything is, is fantastic and not problematic and that, that song In Your Eyes is a very sweet song and I'm just, like, oh. Is it In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel? Yep. I love that song. Yep, that is the, that is the song but it's just that, that, um, that boombox moment is, like, it's very iconic for a reason. Like, it's a very, I don't know, my heart swelled when it happened. I was just, like, oh. Wait, that's, the song that he plays on the boombox? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. Wow. Uh, Sara Bareilles does a really great cover of it. It's on her, like, Love Song Stripped album. It's incredible. I love, I heard that song first through her cover and then. It's, it's a very good song, okay? Mm-hmm. It's very good. It's a good song. So, and, and I think I had to, like, rent it off of Amazon or something so I don't know where you can watch it but it, I highly recommend it. It's, like I said, it's very short. It's only, like, an hour and a half, I think. And it's just, I don't know, it's just, it's good. It's my favorite. 80s movie, no. Yeah, I'm also kind of a sucker for, like, first love stories. Yeah. I'm like, this is cute. This is so stupid. It'll know any better. I think that actually is a bit of a segue into, um, what I wanted to bring up with anime and manga romances. Mm-hmm. Because I love, like, the sweet, soft, like, first love genre. Mm-hmm. I was trying to figure out what my favorite romances in anime and manga were. And with manga, I had a lot of different lists of them. With anime, it was a little easier but I'll go into manga first. I used to read a lot of slice of life, um, manga. Oh, yeah. Uh, like, just a ton and starting with, like, okay, I believe in the past I considered Peach Girl a slice of life but really it's a soap opera. I was thinking about that the other day. I was like, what manga? What did I read? I'm so glad. I just read a lot of Peach Girl. For our listeners, um, I owned every single volume of Peach Girl, um, which is a very great soap opera manga. It maybe doesn't age super well. There are some things that are, like, there's one, like, It's not too bad. Yeah, but I'm thinking particularly of this, the mean girl character who, they're kind of friends but the mean girl Oh, yeah, she's the worst. Yes, he, like, sets up She is mentally unstable. Uh, she sets up, like, non-con, uh, I'm just gonna say, like, rape attempts for the main character that don't happen but it's, like, she set them up, like, she sent a gigolo to her house. Anyway, it's, like, a whole thing and it's, like, or gigolo. I think that was the first time I read that word, gigolo. Yeah. It was in that manga. Anyway. Gigolo. Yeah, thinking about it more, I'm just, like, this doesn't age super well but the art is pretty and I like the main character a lot. Momo, she's good. Anyway, I read, I had all of the books and I read the Change of Heart, like, um, spinoff first and then I went back and read the first volume and then I had Peach Girl say a story. Anyway, I owned all of them and then when I was cleaning out my room for my move, I had all these books and I didn't want to sell these ones because Peach Girl meant a lot to me when I was younger and reading all of it. So I gave them all the peony and now they have a good home at the place. Yeah, they're right next to me. I'm so glad. I, I, I have a, like, a random skinny bookcase. Oh, perfect. And they, they've just taken up, like, three-fourths of it. It's very good. They're Tokyo Pop, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So those are, like, super rare. Just, I'm very happy they have a place and they are not just, like, in a dumpster fire somewhere. Oh, no. No, they are mine. They are all mine and you can borrow them whenever you want. The best home. Thank you. We can just co-share them. Yes. I love, I love Peach Girl a lot. But that being said, it's not really a romance. It, because it's, like, ooh, it, it, it's a love triangle but it's not, like, a romance, really. It's just, it's just a soap opera drama. But my favorite romance of manga were more of, like, the actual slice of life things. So first, like, first that came to mind was Honey and Clover, which doesn't focus so much on the romance of it. I don't know if you've read it or watched it, but it's also an anime. It has two scenes of anime and then it has a live-action movie. And the live-action movie is really good. It, cuts off, like, it ends kind of in the middle of the manga series. But if you read the whole series all the way through, I think it has a really satisfying ending that also kind of mentions, like, it, it finally answers the question of why is it called Honey and Clover? That's revealed in literally the last or second to last chapter.
