{"text": " I think we spent like two minutes discussing Brooklyn Nine-Nine in this podcast. Should we like reclassify this as just a conversation podcast? We've been having that, you know, I don't know, maybe. I mean, it's this is probably a conversation you and I should have like at another time. But like, I don't know. I need to sit and like audit my feelings about the show because I'm not sure how I feel about it. Do you want to like mute for a little while? I'm sorry? Like, I mean, I still like this show, but I don't know if it's worth podcasting about right now. Yeah, I kind of. I have no idea what I what I like levels of engagement with the community are or anything like that. I don't know how engaged the community is because I don't pay attention to that sort of thing. But I don't feel like we're prioritizing this podcast. I mean, a big part of it is just like our real lives are so crazy right now, especially mine, because I like did the move and my job is really intense and it's like brand new job, you know? Yeah. And the forms of media I mostly care about consuming have shifted since we started this. This is the only sitcom I'm watching. Yeah. Yeah. I was watching. I still like it, but I don't. Sitcoms don't matter to me very much right now. Yeah, I think I was watching more sitcoms when I was watching this and then all my sitcoms either got canceled or are like on hiatus or whatever. And I'm also like behind on all of my TV because my set top box got lost. This move has really fucked me up, man. And now I just watch anime and wrestling. It does make it a little harder to talk about the larger television landscape. Yeah, I mean, something like that. Something might be happening. Yeah, I don't know. I think. Well, I do think we and I probably should sit down and talk about that. Maybe not in this podcast, but like in this. Yeah, we don't put this outward facing. We also I will say, though, like even with us being irresponsible, me being irresponsible at the editing and posting and everything, we still have a sizable audience. Like it's not insignificant. It's smaller than it was at our peak when we were really on. I definitely think a combination of like our interest shifting plus like season two not being engaging enough for us after how much potential season one had going out. Like really impacted not only my level of engagement with the show, but also like. I don't know. Things change. I also think that like. As I've listened to more podcasts, I've become kind of skeptical of the idea of like. A weekly like. Focused on something the size of a 30 minute episode of television podcast. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think a part of it is also like this was created, at least from my perspective, as a reaction to just not having a good way to have like a threaded long form conversation about the show when I want to have one. The problem is not every week warrants that kind of conversation. We could theoretically shift the format. To like. A once in a while check in on a few episodes. Talk about where the show has been going over the last month or so. Talk about where we think it's going and also like our other media feelings since last time we talked. And. Have it be longer. And more meaningfully. Shall we do it? Yeah. And not just like because we're like kind of necessarily restricted to knee jerk. Oh, it's going well. It's going badly. What's going on things right now? We don't get to have a lot of perspective. And I think more substantive is more useful. I'm not sure that weekly. Is as useful as substantive. Is just like. I don't know. A really talky blog post. Yeah. I also. I was also thinking about this. Like we're not professional TV critics. So we're like if we were, we would be doing this wrong. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I'd be down to like shifting this to being like a once a month format podcast where like we just kind of at the end of the month, we kind of look back at the three or four episodes that have come by that month. If there have been episodes. Or we just do like a check in with each other and be like, hey, what have you been hearing? That'd be. I'd actually be really down for that. Or like, what have you been seeing? What conversations have been coming up? It also means, though, that you're kind of breaking up. I'm not quite sure what you just said. Oh, is this is this helpful? Yeah. Yeah. I said I'd be down to like switch it to once a month or whatever and kind of like look back at the episodes that have come out and sort of. Talk about them sort of in a in a single run. I also think if we did that, though, you and I would both need to be a little. I at least would have to be more responsible for myself. But like noting down interesting Tumblr posts that I get sent or noting down talking points that I think of like on the bus, you know. Right. So like I think the once a month format means we both have to prepare a little bit more. On the other hand, it's a lot overall like a lesser time commitment for both of us in the long term. Yeah. I don't really know what I think. Like of the podcasts I listen to, the only ones kind of focused on reviewing a single piece of media each episode is so like. There's a podcast I listen to that like kind of talks about a video game each episode, but also talks about like a million other things. And like the two guys on it spend the whole time like joke-ily weirdly flirting. So like they have an energy that we can't hope to match. I mean, we kind of I also think a couple of mentions to me like our our vibe is different now that we're not in the same room. Crazy. Yeah. I mean. Podcasts with remote correspondence are worse. They're a lot. They're just worse. Yeah, they really are. I mean, we've we've like because I edit them. Right. Like we're doing OK. All things considered. It took us a few episodes to get our sort of like our rhythm back, but we're doing OK. It's just not like 80 percent where we used to be 100 percent. Maybe. I don't know. I do. I do like the idea of dialing it back to once a month, not just because my job is super demanding, but also because like. My job isn't like hugely like time demanding, but it is quite. Like. Kind of. I don't know. It's mentally and emotionally demanding. Right now, I don't feel like I'm doing a lot, but I do feel quite worn out. And that's mostly just because like the year is about to be over. Thank God. Yeah. Yeah. And I that's that's a big part of it, too. Like you and I'll be going on vacation. The show will be going on hiatus for a while soon. Like all these things are coming. So, yeah, let's after this, let's let's just dial it back to once a month. I think that's probably for the best for both of our sanities as well as for like after what? After this episode that like we're recording. Sure. Yeah. And then we'll just dial it back. Well, is there one next week? I think the next week. Fuck it. I don't care. There's a Thanksgiving episode. I don't know if it's before or after. It doesn't matter. Like we'll just record later in December and we'll just cover a bunch of episodes at the same time. Like unless something really massive, interesting and landmark happens. I mean, Terry's baby is coming, but like. Did this episode is probably the most important as far as like things, plot lines that we actively. Are tracking. Do you know what I mean? Like I care about Terry's baby, but not as much as I am frustrated by how Jake and Amy are shaking out. Although I feel less frustrated upon rewatch, but we can talk about that. Our next episode until like the holidays, whichever ones they are. Okay. Cause like their Christmas episode is episode 10, which will probably air what December, like around December 10th. I do not know. Something like that. I don't know. Welcome to back in the field. My name is Carl. And my name is Arthie. And today we're talking about the mattress. When I heard the title of this, I thought it had something to do with going to the mattresses. I know. I really. I kind of wish this had been about that and not like a literal mattress, but you know. Although that would mean that it was about an incredibly vicious escalation of a gang war. Well, it could have been about like an escalation of a gang war. An escalation of some type, maybe not necessarily directly related to gang violence. That's a little bit abstract. Well, this show also tends to be very literalist about its titles. Yeah. It was always going to be about a mattress. I know. I know. So I, today's Wednesday when we're recording this morning, I put out the episode I was supposed to put out last Friday. Not things have not happened. I've not been great, Carl. What? I've not been very good about putting out the episodes on time. I feel kind of bad. Yeah. I don't know. Well, I'm going to keep trying to be better about it, but you know, if wishes were horses or whatever. Well, it's not working out like this time because I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be editing it before, I don't know, Saturday or Sunday. I think, I think I'm just going to edit it. Oh. Yeah, I think I'll take it. Okay. Well, I'm working from home tomorrow, so I sort of end up with two bonus hours because my. I'm not commuting. Yeah, exactly. So I can take it. Okay. Yeah. So it's fine. Hey, so. Deciding on air. Oh, yeah. A hundred percent. But things we should be deciding on air is, hey, Carl, what happened in this episode? Do I get to decide that? Yes, you do. Okay. I swear I watched the episode. What happened in this episode? In the A-plot, Jake and Amy work drug case together to find a new drug called Taxi. But bubbling under the surface is Amy's physical and emotional discomfort with Jake's mattress and his refusal to buy a new mattress, which ruins their case and threatens to ruin their romance. In the B-plot, in the B-plot, Boyle accidentally, well, Boyle gets pissed at Holt for parking in the B-plot. His car across one and a half parking spaces, one of which is Boyle's parking space. And then scratches his car and almost gets murdered before Gina saves the day. And in the C-plot, Terry continues to underestimate ballerinas. And it's kind of a pig about it. But does sort of prevent Rosa from permanently burning the bridge with her little brother. And then big brother, little brother thing. And maybe killing him too. So not much killing happened in this episode. Oh, also, Jake and Amy figure it out and he buys a mattress. Yes. Go team. Yes. Okay. Go team romance. I, okay. I have a lot of opinions about the Jake-Amy plotline, but I want to get to them last because I suspect they'll be like, me ranting for 15 minutes. P.S. If I sound garbage, it's because I'm kind of sick. So it's what I get for trying to do something crazy. I did a day trip to San Francisco on Sunday and I definitely went in and out. Aren't you in L.A.? I am in L.A., yeah. Isn't that six hours? It was a 70-minute flight. Each way? Wait, you day tripped a flight? Yeah. I flew. Arthie, that's crazy bad for the planet. I know. I know. I was the most- Arthie, you're basically a war criminal. It was the most rich people thing I've ever done. And I'm a little bit ashamed, but it was worth it. Arthie, in a hundred years, the amount of jet fuel you used will be enough to start a small war. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Well, I did this and there's no helping it now. It's in the past, but I did this. You could learn from what you've done. I'm doing this again. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By the way, Sunil Patel says hi. Oh, hey, Sunil. We've met in person once. You've never listened to this podcast. He might now. He likes this show. He might have listened to the other podcast I was on. I don't know. I hope some of our listeners listen to that one. It's a good one. It is. I talk about Brooklyn Nine-Nine on it, so you should go listen to it. Although there's nothing I haven't said here about 150 times. I, what was I going to say? Oh, well, I went up to San Francisco and because I flew, I definitely caught the plane cold. Ah. So, it probably didn't help that I was like, I woke up at like five in the morning. I like went to bed at like midnight. Like, I didn't sleep enough. I didn't drink enough water. I didn't anything enough. So. Also, you're now being haunted by the ghost of a baby Triceratops. Yes, there is that. I forgot. Thank you. It was really easy to forget about her in the corner just snarling at me, but now you reminded me. You used me for a day trip. Oh, my God, Carl. What is even happening? Okay. Let's work backwards. So, let's start with the C plot. Okay. Stop underestimating ballet. Yeah, seriously. I love her. Like, Terry goes, don't, don't, like, what is it? He's like, don't be too afraid. She was a ballerina. And the guy goes, ha ha. And she goes, it gave me the physical skills I need to, like, to strangle you with my feet. Yep. Yeah. Apparently, strong feet is a thing you can have. So, I wouldn't mess. Terry was, Terry had his heart in the right place for some of this episode, but man, dude, lay off the ballet. Especially. Just because you spent your time getting buffed due to, like, you know, high impact, high speed, ball-based man wrestling doesn't make you a more legitimate athlete than her. Also, like, most football players end up taking ballet as a conditioning exercise anyway. What? Yeah. You gotta be kidding me. I'm not joking. Most football players end up taking. They don't have, they don't have even moderately compatible body type. Something, I mean, because the, the, the nature of football has become about a lot of, like, rapid, um, the game has gotten faster is sort of how sports people talk about it. So, football players to remain agile and, and continue to have, like, the sort of long length of muscles that they need to do those kinds of movements end up conditioning with ballet as an, it's a support, it's, um, how do you say? It's a, it's a supportive activity that they do. Like, they do it in addition to their training. I see. Huh. Yeah. So, you mean they do, like, bar workouts? Yeah, they'll do a bar workout or the, like, what you and I would think of as a bar workout they'll do, which is sort of like a low level. They basically end up doing, like, what? The, the first couple years of ballet course as, like, their conditioning and strength. Huh. Um, yeah, it's like a Pilates bar kind of situation. But the, the larger point here is that Terry has no leg to stand on. If Terry were a serious football player, he would have been doing ballet courses. You're dumb about this, dude. Also, don't, don't laugh about her pink hair. Like, the most deadly female wrestler in, in the NXT had bright pink hair and she could murder you. So, I ever, I recommend everyone go, like, type into your search bar, WWE Asuka, A-S-U-K-A, murder princess. Oh my god. Deadly warrior. Wait, she, I didn't know that. What? I didn't know that, that she has pink hair. How did I miss that? I, did I, I showed you one of her matches, right? Or did I not? I think you showed me, like, I, you may have shown me, like, her, her profile and I just, how did I miss that? I missed that she had pink hair. God. You might have seen an old picture of her as Kana when she was, she wrestled in Japan as Kana. Um, and she, I think she had red hair then. Oh, yeah. But, like, I'll send you a picture of her in her ring gear. Yeah? Ignore this is that from H-A-W-T celebs dot com. Not my fault. Nothing to shake it. I wonder if that was a reference to, didn't Stephanie Beatriz, like, pink her hair over the summer? I don't know. Okay. Cool. I don't have Insta. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Also, I'm never gonna say Insta again.

And the forms of media I mostly care about consuming have shifted since we started this. This is the only sitcom I'm watching. Yeah. Yeah. I was watching. I still like it, but I don't. Sitcoms don't matter to me very much right now. Yeah, I think I was watching more sitcoms when I was watching this and then all my sitcoms either got canceled or are like on hiatus or whatever. And I'm also like behind on all of my TV because my set top box got lost. This move has really fucked me up, man. And now I just watch anime and wrestling. It does make it a little harder to talk about the larger television landscape. Yeah, I mean, something like that. Something might be happening. Yeah, I don't know. I think. Well, I do think we and I probably should sit down and talk about that. Maybe not in this podcast, but like in this. Yeah, we don't put this outward facing. We also I will say, though, like even with us being irresponsible, me being irresponsible at the editing and posting and everything, we still have a sizable audience. Like it's not insignificant. It's smaller than it was at our peak when we were really on. I definitely think a combination of like our interest shifting plus like season two not being engaging enough for us after how much potential season one had going out. Like really impacted not only my level of engagement with the show, but also like. I don't know. Things change. I also think that like. As I've listened to more podcasts, I've become kind of skeptical of the idea of like. A weekly like. Focused on something the size of a 30 minute episode of television podcast. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think a part of it is also like this was created, at least from my perspective, as a reaction to just not having a good way to have like a threaded long form conversation about the show when I want to have one. The problem is not every week warrants that kind of conversation. We could theoretically shift the format. To like. A once in a while check in on a few episodes. Talk about where the show has been going over the last month or so. Talk about where we think it's going and also like our other media feelings since last time we talked. And. Have it be longer. And more meaningfully. Shall we do it? Yeah. And not just like because we're like kind of necessarily restricted to knee jerk. Oh, it's going well. It's going badly. What's going on things right now? We don't get to have a lot of perspective. And I think more substantive is more useful. I'm not sure that weekly. Is as useful as substantive. Is just like. I don't know. A really talky blog post. Yeah. I also. I was also thinking about this. Like we're not professional TV critics. So we're like if we were, we would be doing this wrong. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I'd be down to like shifting this to being like a once a month format podcast where like we just kind of at the end of the month, we kind of look back at the three or four episodes that have come by that month. If there have been episodes. Or we just do like a check in with each other and be like, hey, what have you been hearing? That'd be. I'd actually be really down for that. Or like, what have you been seeing? What conversations have been coming up? It also means, though, that you're kind of breaking up. I'm not quite sure what you just said. Oh, is this is this helpful? Yeah. Yeah. I said I'd be down to like switch it to once a month or whatever and kind of like look back at the episodes that have come out and sort of. Talk about them sort of in a in a single run. I also think if we did that, though, you and I would both need to be a little. I at least would have to be more responsible for myself. But like noting down interesting Tumblr posts that I get sent or noting down talking points that I think of like on the bus, you know. Right. So like I think the once a month format means we both have to prepare a little bit more. On the other hand, it's a lot overall like a lesser time commitment for both of us in the long term. Yeah. I don't really know what I think. Like of the podcasts I listen to, the only ones kind of focused on reviewing a single piece of media each episode is so like. There's a podcast I listen to that like kind of talks about a video game each episode, but also talks about like a million other things. And like the two guys on it spend the whole time like joke-ily weirdly flirting. So like they have an energy that we can't hope to match. I mean, we kind of I also think a couple of mentions to me like our our vibe is different now that we're not in the same room. Crazy. Yeah. I mean. Podcasts with remote correspondence are worse. They're a lot. They're just worse. Yeah, they really are. I mean, we've we've like because I edit them. Right. Like we're doing OK. All things considered. It took us a few episodes to get our sort of like our rhythm back, but we're doing OK. It's just not like 80 percent where we used to be 100 percent. Maybe. I don't know. I do. I do like the idea of dialing it back to once a month, not just because my job is super demanding, but also because like. My job isn't like hugely like time demanding, but it is quite. Like. Kind of. I don't know. It's mentally and emotionally demanding. Right now, I don't feel like I'm doing a lot, but I do feel quite worn out. And that's mostly just because like the year is about to be over. Thank God. Yeah. Yeah. And I that's that's a big part of it, too. Like you and I'll be going on vacation. The show will be going on hiatus for a while soon. Like all these things are coming. So, yeah, let's after this, let's let's just dial it back to once a month. I think that's probably for the best for both of our sanities as well as for like after what? After this episode that like we're recording. Sure. Yeah. And then we'll just dial it back. Well, is there one next week? I think the next week. Fuck it. I don't care. There's a Thanksgiving episode. I don't know if it's before or after. It doesn't matter. Like we'll just record later in December and we'll just cover a bunch of episodes at the same time. Like unless something really massive, interesting and landmark happens. I mean, Terry's baby is coming, but like. Did this episode is probably the most important as far as like things, plot lines that we actively. Are tracking. Do you know what I mean? Like I care about Terry's baby, but not as much as I am frustrated by how Jake and Amy are shaking out. Although I feel less frustrated upon rewatch, but we can talk about that. Our next episode until like the holidays, whichever ones they are. Okay. Cause like their Christmas episode is episode 10, which will probably air what December, like around December 10th. I do not know. Something like that. I don't know. Welcome to back in the field. My name is Carl. And my name is Arthie. And today we're talking about the mattress. When I heard the title of this, I thought it had something to do with going to the mattresses. I know. I really. I kind of wish this had been about that and not like a literal mattress, but you know. Although that would mean that it was about an incredibly vicious escalation of a gang war. Well, it could have been about like an escalation of a gang war. An escalation of some type, maybe not necessarily directly related to gang violence. That's a little bit abstract. Well, this show also tends to be very literalist about its titles. Yeah. It was always going to be about a mattress. I know. I know. So I, today's Wednesday when we're recording this morning, I put out the episode I was supposed to put out last Friday. Not things have not happened. I've not been great, Carl. What? I've not been very good about putting out the episodes on time. I feel kind of bad. Yeah. I don't know. Well, I'm going to keep trying to be better about it, but you know, if wishes were horses or whatever. Well, it's not working out like this time because I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be editing it before, I don't know, Saturday or Sunday. I think, I think I'm just going to edit it. Oh. Yeah, I think I'll take it. Okay. Well, I'm working from home tomorrow, so I sort of end up with two bonus hours because my. I'm not commuting. Yeah, exactly. So I can take it. Okay. Yeah. So it's fine. Hey, so. Deciding on air. Oh, yeah. A hundred percent. But things we should be deciding on air is, hey, Carl, what happened in this episode? Do I get to decide that? Yes, you do. Okay. I swear I watched the episode. What happened in this episode? In the A-plot, Jake and Amy work drug case together to find a new drug called Taxi. But bubbling under the surface is Amy's physical and emotional discomfort with Jake's mattress and his refusal to buy a new mattress, which ruins their case and threatens to ruin their romance. In the B-plot, in the B-plot, Boyle accidentally, well, Boyle gets pissed at Holt for parking in the B-plot. His car across one and a half parking spaces, one of which is Boyle's parking space. And then scratches his car and almost gets murdered before Gina saves the day. And in the C-plot, Terry continues to underestimate ballerinas. And it's kind of a pig about it. But does sort of prevent Rosa from permanently burning the bridge with her little brother. And then big brother, little brother thing. And maybe killing him too. So not much killing happened in this episode. Oh, also, Jake and Amy figure it out and he buys a mattress. Yes. Go team. Yes. Okay. Go team romance. I, okay. I have a lot of opinions about the Jake-Amy plotline, but I want to get to them last because I suspect they'll be like, me ranting for 15 minutes. P.S. If I sound garbage, it's because I'm kind of sick. So it's what I get for trying to do something crazy. I did a day trip to San Francisco on Sunday and I definitely went in and out. Aren't you in L.A.? I am in L.A., yeah. Isn't that six hours? It was a 70-minute flight. Each way? Wait, you day tripped a flight? Yeah. I flew. Arthie, that's crazy bad for the planet. I know. I know. I was the most- Arthie, you're basically a war criminal. It was the most rich people thing I've ever done. And I'm a little bit ashamed, but it was worth it. Arthie, in a hundred years, the amount of jet fuel you used will be enough to start a small war. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Well, I did this and there's no helping it now. It's in the past, but I did this. You could learn from what you've done. I'm doing this again. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By the way, Sunil Patel says hi. Oh, hey, Sunil. We've met in person once. You've never listened to this podcast. He might now. He likes this show. He might have listened to the other podcast I was on. I don't know. I hope some of our listeners listen to that one. It's a good one. It is. I talk about Brooklyn Nine-Nine on it, so you should go listen to it. Although there's nothing I haven't said here about 150 times. I, what was I going to say? Oh, well, I went up to San Francisco and because I flew, I definitely caught the plane cold. Ah. So, it probably didn't help that I was like, I woke up at like five in the morning. I like went to bed at like midnight. Like, I didn't sleep enough. I didn't drink enough water. I didn't anything enough. So. Also, you're now being haunted by the ghost of a baby Triceratops. Yes, there is that. I forgot. Thank you. It was really easy to forget about her in the corner just snarling at me, but now you reminded me. You used me for a day trip. Oh, my God, Carl. What is even happening? Okay. Let's work backwards. So, let's start with the C plot. Okay. Stop underestimating ballet. Yeah, seriously. I love her. Like, Terry goes, don't, don't, like, what is it? He's like, don't be too afraid. She was a ballerina. And the guy goes, ha ha. And she goes, it gave me the physical skills I need to, like, to strangle you with my feet. Yep. Yeah. Apparently, strong feet is a thing you can have. So, I wouldn't mess. Terry was, Terry had his heart in the right place for some of this episode, but man, dude, lay off the ballet. Especially. Just because you spent your time getting buffed due to, like, you know, high impact, high speed, ball-based man wrestling doesn't make you a more legitimate athlete than her. Also, like, most football players end up taking ballet as a conditioning exercise anyway. What? Yeah. You gotta be kidding me. I'm not joking. Most football players end up taking. They don't have, they don't have even moderately compatible body type. Something, I mean, because the, the, the nature of football has become about a lot of, like, rapid, um, the game has gotten faster is sort of how sports people talk about it. So, football players to remain agile and, and continue to have, like, the sort of long length of muscles that they need to do those kinds of movements end up conditioning with ballet as an, it's a support, it's, um, how do you say? It's a, it's a supportive activity that they do. Like, they do it in addition to their training. I see. Huh. Yeah. So, you mean they do, like, bar workouts? Yeah, they'll do a bar workout or the, like, what you and I would think of as a bar workout they'll do, which is sort of like a low level. They basically end up doing, like, what? The, the first couple years of ballet course as, like, their conditioning and strength. Huh. Um, yeah, it's like a Pilates bar kind of situation. But the, the larger point here is that Terry has no leg to stand on. If Terry were a serious football player, he would have been doing ballet courses. You're dumb about this, dude. Also, don't, don't laugh about her pink hair. Like, the most deadly female wrestler in, in the NXT had bright pink hair and she could murder you. So, I ever, I recommend everyone go, like, type into your search bar, WWE Asuka, A-S-U-K-A, murder princess. Oh my god. Deadly warrior. Wait, she, I didn't know that. What? I didn't know that, that she has pink hair. How did I miss that? I, did I, I showed you one of her matches, right? Or did I not? I think you showed me, like, I, you may have shown me, like, her, her profile and I just, how did I miss that? I missed that she had pink hair. God. You might have seen an old picture of her as Kana when she was, she wrestled in Japan as Kana. Um, and she, I think she had red hair then. Oh, yeah. But, like, I'll send you a picture of her in her ring gear. Yeah? Ignore this is that from H-A-W-T celebs dot com. Not my fault. Nothing to shake it. I wonder if that was a reference to, didn't Stephanie Beatriz, like, pink her hair over the summer? I don't know. Okay. Cool. I don't have Insta. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Also, I'm never gonna say Insta again.
