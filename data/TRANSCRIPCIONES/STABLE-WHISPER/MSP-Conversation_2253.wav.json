{"text": " Stephen and other characters, I think in modern shows, they make it a lot more complex where there are multiple sides to the story instead of just kind of the good versus evil thing. Stephen really wants to know the person and like he changes them. It's not that they necessarily were good underneath all of it, but it's that he helps their hearts like come out. And that's very, very cool to have like this little boy main character show so much compassion, especially for kids of all ages and genders and everything watching. And it's not like teased or made fun of for acting this way. He's like awarded and like praised for it. And it's like, hey, you know, it's a really cool thing. Like we could have they could have like destroyed the city and talked them down. Everyone loves him for it. I think that's it's really it's I love the the trend of goodness that we see in new recent media, especially because the world is like pretty shitty right now. Just yeah, it's been particularly I'm not going to get into it. But I think that I read this article about what they called nice core movies, things like there was this movie called Hearts Beat Loud, which had Nick Offerman in it and like his daughter. And they just it's about them ending their relationship and like forming a band. And that's it. And it's very like about the goodness of relationships and things and like the Paddington Bear movies. And just how like goodness can be entertaining, too. And we don't need all this grittiness. We don't need we don't need to see a lot of like badness. We sometimes just need like a good feel good movie that makes you I don't know, just believe in goodness of things. Yeah, that article actually reminded me of something. And this isn't technically magical girl, but it is the fairy tale sort of genre. Well, I mean, it is. But it reminded me of this. So I have I have kind of mixed feelings about the live action movies that have been coming out. Like, they're great. Sometimes they're terrible. And but I love the Cinderella remake. Yes, because it really took me by surprise, like how, how good it like just how good it was. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't a complete copy of the original. And it was so one of the taglines of the movie was have courage and be kind. And that just sounds like kind of like some Pinterest saying, you know, like, it's just whatever. But it was really, it made a lot of sense as you watch the movies, because the whole point is that like, her life is pretty terrible. And she, she doesn't, you know, people complain about like, well, she should have just why did she wait on a prince to save her? She should have just left. But the movie makes it very obvious that she doesn't have anywhere else to go. And also that house that mansion is kind of the last thing of her parents that she has. So she feels very loyal to staying there and keeping that in her family, which is now just her really. And it takes a lot of bravery to stay. And, you know, still be kind, like it was, it could have been very easy for her to turn bitter and to turn mean and to, you know, just be a mean, bitter person. And she still stayed kind. And that's very difficult to do. And it's like, I don't know, it was a nice, like, lesson that I wasn't expecting to get out of it. So I really love that motto. And I think it applies to certainly Steven Universe and a lot of those other, other shows were instead of fighting evil with, with violence, and actually, you know, like having sword fights and stabbing somebody, you know, it's like, an attempt to maybe convince the person not to be evil. You know, it's like, it sounds silly, but there are a lot of stories these days where it's like compassion and, and kindness and stuff is really what ends up saving the day. That's cool. I agree. Cinderella also took me by surprise. I remember going in to see it just as a, I knew it was going to be pretty. I'd seen the trailers and things. I was a little confused if it was going to be a musical or not. But I went in to see it. And I just walked out just like, it was just a very good experience. And it, you're so right, like the have courage, be kind, seems like it would be cheesy. But the way that it was portrayed in that movie, I think was really powerful, especially with how the first Cinderella was made. It, I am grateful that we get to consume more media now that is so carefully and complexly constructed, where I feel like a lot of things, at least that I grew up with were a little more straightforward. They are for kids, and I get it. But with Cinderella, it's like, that is the last bit of her family. And it was really, the movie really emphasized that. Yeah, because I think there was one scene where she was like going to the market or something. And someone, like some other character, like just straight up asked her, why don't you leave? And she gave this really like sweet response of like, well, I, you know, I can't, there's nowhere else for me to go. And that's my home. And I was just like, oh, it just, yeah. And having her as a role model is really wonderful because she, like, kindness, is so hard. And she, she could be angry sometimes, but also like forgiveness is really difficult as well. I think sometimes, I don't think everyone necessarily deserves forgiveness. This is all, of course, like, you can't just say blanket things because like different circumstances, I get it. But I do think that there is, there is strength in being able to be kind and courageous. And Cinderella was a really good movie. And now I need to rewatch it. I've been wanting to rewatch it for so long. But I don't, it's not on anything. And her dress, though, just like as a side note, her dress and like the way it like, when she spun, how it twirled. I was just like, I was, I was stunned by it because I did not think it would look that beautiful. Oh, yeah. I mean, as a, as a cosplayer. And I've seen, I've seen people cosplay her before. I'm just like, dang, I have a friend who cosplays the prince. And I'm just like, all the costumes in that movie were so good. I know. I mean, she sort of has a magical girl transformation, I guess. Yeah. But it just did remind me because I feel like that's a, it's a main theme that I've been noticing in a lot of media these days. And since a lot of the media that I still watch is kind of the magical cartoony stuff. It's something I've been noticing. And it's, I think that's just a, you know, it's kind of reflects what the people that are making these shows want to put out as messages. Yeah. I think, I think the point is that we shouldn't bear our heads in the sand with like news and bad things and everything and the shit going on. But I think that the people putting good out into the world and putting up, uplifting like stories and things like that and, and good deeds and everything. I mean, it helps make things a little better. So I like, I like appreciating that. It's good. And I don't know if this is like really, I don't know if I can't say if this is like a cultural thing or not, but I feel like, especially now with a lot of Maho Shoujo titles kind of being a little bit more gritty, like they're, they're tough issues are really dire and really intense. Whereas you still have that in Western shows, but it's a little bit dialed down. Like there's still a lot of, you've got like betrayal and you've got like, you know, conflicted feelings for the protagonists and hard choices and all that sort of conflict. Like it's still going on, but it's different kind of conflict. It's not nearly as intense. I feel like. I think, I think Maho Shoujo has always had a little more tragedy than the Western genre adapted. Like with Sailor Moon, how Queen Serena and Endymion died. Like the, it has this whole tragic backstory of, of their kingdoms, like being destroyed and wars and things. And while magical girl things in the West kind of still deal with heart issues, they're not as senselessly tragic sometimes. Okay. Every day. I regret saying the word senselessly because I think it has a point and it can be also very like beautiful moving. But particularly in regards to a magical rising project, which I love is still, it has an element of cruelty. To it that the characters eventually overcome, but not after, but they've already lost so much. So they can't ever get back what they've lost, but they have still, they can maybe forge a better world than what they had come to know. Whereas with magical girl anime and, or magical girl cartoons and Western things, I think they still deal with like a lot of pretty dark things, like at least in Star Wars is the forces of evil. Steven universe also has a lot of very dark, truly upsetting things. Poor Steven. I just want to protect him. And he just wants to protect everyone he loves and everyone he knows. And a lot of shit has gone down and all of this, but it's still not quite as hopeless. I think as at least some of the magical girl genre or Maho Shodra that I enjoy. Yeah. I feel like it's a lot more bittersweet. Like so much bad stuff has happened that, you know, I'm, I'm willing to go forward and give you example of like, for them, I guess. Yeah, it's not just like sugarcoated cutesy stuff that doesn't really, you know, doesn't really impact you. It's just like fun to watch. It's, it's like, there's a lot of real life things that go on. And it's, it's just good writing. And what else is there to talk about? I feel like I, I, we, I kind of regret because I think we talked about our like conclusion stuff before, before I got to what I wanted to talk about. What else did you want to talk about? But I wanted to talk about how Western shows different, differ from our Mahou Shoujo, particularly with Miraculous Ladybug. I wanted to bring that up because I adore this show as well. Yeah. While I don't, from what we've seen so far, it does not go into as deep themes as we were just talking about with Steven Universe or Star vs. the Force of Evil or She-Ra or whatever. Although it does, but it's much more in a personal, interpersonal and like familial way, especially with Adrian and his, his, his father. Yeah, it seems a little more lighthearted, but I'm going to, I'm going to quickly, I'm going to quickly give a brief kind of synopsis sort of thing of this real quick. Miraculous Ladybug features these two kids and it's a French animated show. So you can watch it in the sub or the dub. Dub takes a little bit of getting used to, but I genuinely enjoyed it. And the French sub is like really cute, but it's these two kids and they go to school together. They don't really know each other that well. One of them is Marinette and the other one is Adrian. And Marinette is kind of an awkward, kind of clumsy girl, but she's like silly and goofy, but not like she has personality. She's not necessarily like the every girl who is just average on all accounts. And then Adrian is the very popular boy, but he's also very humble. He's also a supermodel. It's fine. They're like 14. It's okay. And they both, both have these magical items. Marinette has little earrings and Adrian has a ring that helps them transform into Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir. And they are the like superheroes of good luck, good luck, and also bad luck. And they fight together to get rid of these butterflies who infect people and like bring out their like fears or hatred or whatever, turn them into monsters. So the thing with this show that is so, wonderfully addictive is that it is a love square, which I just like absolutely fucking adore. Okay. So Marinette is in love with Adrian because she thinks he's so cool. And like, he's like very cute and everything. Adrian doesn't really know Marinette. He, she's like kind of weird, but like they're friends, I guess. Meanwhile, Cat Noir is absolutely in love with Ladybug. So Adrian is in love with Ladybug and, and Ladybug is in love with Adrian, but they don't know it because it's flipped. And so every time like Cat Noir is with Ladybug, he just like was trying to get her attention. And every time Ladybug or Marinette is with Adrian, she's trying to get his attention, but Adrian doesn't get Marinette and Marinette doesn't get Cat Noir. And it's just like, it's just a lot, but it's very, very cute. And this whole show hinges on secret identities because they both don't know like if the other one or their friends are going to accept them. If they know that they're superheroes, so they're juggling the high school and the superhero aspect of it constantly. And then there's like the big evil villain and we don't really know like who he is. And Marinette is kind of dealing with her friend who is a blogger and this mean girl who loves, who loves Ladybug, but hates Marinette. And then like Adrian has issues with his father and his mom died and there's just a lot going on, but it's not so much tragedy and stuff. It's still like, they are magical girls. They transform with their magical identity. Items into their superhero selves, but it's very much superhero tropes of like, how will they figure out my secret identity? But magical girl things of like, oh no, I need to finish my math homework, but there's a demon like evilized Akuma outside. What are we going to do? And it's very, very cute. And that's, that's my spiel. Everyone should watch it. It's all on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I wanted to talk about with that though. Cause I think the other differences in Western shows we've kind of touched on but definitely a lot of magical girl cartoons take more of the superhero route. They kind of do blend together sometimes. And in Mahou Shoujo, they call them superheroes sometimes, but it's very much, they mean different things culturally, especially in like magical girl cartoons where they have superhero costumes and like people know who they, who the superheroes like personas are, but then they have to very much keep it kind of under wraps. There are, there is an element of secret identities in Mahou Shoujo, I think, but it's a, it's a little less, it's less like, oh no, what if the world knows that I'm miraculous lady bug versus like Mahou Shoujo being like, oh no, what if this cute boy I like knows like what, who I am in my superhero suit? They were like, what, that I fight aliens and that I'm really like really weird. So it kind of takes on a more like global sphere in magical girl cartoons in the West.

instead of just kind of the good versus evil thing. Stephen really wants to know the person and like he changes them. It's not that they necessarily were good underneath all of it, but it's that he helps their hearts like come out. And that's very, very cool to have like this little boy main character show so much compassion, especially for kids of all ages and genders and everything watching. And it's not like teased or made fun of for acting this way. He's like awarded and like praised for it. And it's like, hey, you know, it's a really cool thing. Like we could have they could have like destroyed the city and talked them down. Everyone loves him for it. I think that's it's really it's I love the the trend of goodness that we see in new recent media, especially because the world is like pretty shitty right now. Just yeah, it's been particularly I'm not going to get into it. But I think that I read this article about what they called nice core movies, things like there was this movie called Hearts Beat Loud, which had Nick Offerman in it and like his daughter. And they just it's about them ending their relationship and like forming a band. And that's it. And it's very like about the goodness of relationships and things and like the Paddington Bear movies. And just how like goodness can be entertaining, too. And we don't need all this grittiness. We don't need we don't need to see a lot of like badness. We sometimes just need like a good feel good movie that makes you I don't know, just believe in goodness of things. Yeah, that article actually reminded me of something. And this isn't technically magical girl, but it is the fairy tale sort of genre. Well, I mean, it is. But it reminded me of this. So I have I have kind of mixed feelings about the live action movies that have been coming out. Like, they're great. Sometimes they're terrible. And but I love the Cinderella remake. Yes, because it really took me by surprise, like how, how good it like just how good it was. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't a complete copy of the original. And it was so one of the taglines of the movie was have courage and be kind. And that just sounds like kind of like some Pinterest saying, you know, like, it's just whatever. But it was really, it made a lot of sense as you watch the movies, because the whole point is that like, her life is pretty terrible. And she, she doesn't, you know, people complain about like, well, she should have just why did she wait on a prince to save her? She should have just left. But the movie makes it very obvious that she doesn't have anywhere else to go. And also that house that mansion is kind of the last thing of her parents that she has. So she feels very loyal to staying there and keeping that in her family, which is now just her really. And it takes a lot of bravery to stay. And, you know, still be kind, like it was, it could have been very easy for her to turn bitter and to turn mean and to, you know, just be a mean, bitter person. And she still stayed kind. And that's very difficult to do. And it's like, I don't know, it was a nice, like, lesson that I wasn't expecting to get out of it. So I really love that motto. And I think it applies to certainly Steven Universe and a lot of those other, other shows were instead of fighting evil with, with violence, and actually, you know, like having sword fights and stabbing somebody, you know, it's like, an attempt to maybe convince the person not to be evil. You know, it's like, it sounds silly, but there are a lot of stories these days where it's like compassion and, and kindness and stuff is really what ends up saving the day. That's cool. I agree. Cinderella also took me by surprise. I remember going in to see it just as a, I knew it was going to be pretty. I'd seen the trailers and things. I was a little confused if it was going to be a musical or not. But I went in to see it. And I just walked out just like, it was just a very good experience. And it, you're so right, like the have courage, be kind, seems like it would be cheesy. But the way that it was portrayed in that movie, I think was really powerful, especially with how the first Cinderella was made. It, I am grateful that we get to consume more media now that is so carefully and complexly constructed, where I feel like a lot of things, at least that I grew up with were a little more straightforward. They are for kids, and I get it. But with Cinderella, it's like, that is the last bit of her family. And it was really, the movie really emphasized that. Yeah, because I think there was one scene where she was like going to the market or something. And someone, like some other character, like just straight up asked her, why don't you leave? And she gave this really like sweet response of like, well, I, you know, I can't, there's nowhere else for me to go. And that's my home. And I was just like, oh, it just, yeah. And having her as a role model is really wonderful because she, like, kindness, is so hard. And she, she could be angry sometimes, but also like forgiveness is really difficult as well. I think sometimes, I don't think everyone necessarily deserves forgiveness. This is all, of course, like, you can't just say blanket things because like different circumstances, I get it. But I do think that there is, there is strength in being able to be kind and courageous. And Cinderella was a really good movie. And now I need to rewatch it. I've been wanting to rewatch it for so long. But I don't, it's not on anything. And her dress, though, just like as a side note, her dress and like the way it like, when she spun, how it twirled. I was just like, I was, I was stunned by it because I did not think it would look that beautiful. Oh, yeah. I mean, as a, as a cosplayer. And I've seen, I've seen people cosplay her before. I'm just like, dang, I have a friend who cosplays the prince. And I'm just like, all the costumes in that movie were so good. I know. I mean, she sort of has a magical girl transformation, I guess. Yeah. But it just did remind me because I feel like that's a, it's a main theme that I've been noticing in a lot of media these days. And since a lot of the media that I still watch is kind of the magical cartoony stuff. It's something I've been noticing. And it's, I think that's just a, you know, it's kind of reflects what the people that are making these shows want to put out as messages. Yeah. I think, I think the point is that we shouldn't bear our heads in the sand with like news and bad things and everything and the shit going on. But I think that the people putting good out into the world and putting up, uplifting like stories and things like that and, and good deeds and everything. I mean, it helps make things a little better. So I like, I like appreciating that. It's good. And I don't know if this is like really, I don't know if I can't say if this is like a cultural thing or not, but I feel like, especially now with a lot of Maho Shoujo titles kind of being a little bit more gritty, like they're, they're tough issues are really dire and really intense. Whereas you still have that in Western shows, but it's a little bit dialed down. Like there's still a lot of, you've got like betrayal and you've got like, you know, conflicted feelings for the protagonists and hard choices and all that sort of conflict. Like it's still going on, but it's different kind of conflict. It's not nearly as intense. I feel like. I think, I think Maho Shoujo has always had a little more tragedy than the Western genre adapted. Like with Sailor Moon, how Queen Serena and Endymion died. Like the, it has this whole tragic backstory of, of their kingdoms, like being destroyed and wars and things. And while magical girl things in the West kind of still deal with heart issues, they're not as senselessly tragic sometimes. Okay. Every day. I regret saying the word senselessly because I think it has a point and it can be also very like beautiful moving. But particularly in regards to a magical rising project, which I love is still, it has an element of cruelty. To it that the characters eventually overcome, but not after, but they've already lost so much. So they can't ever get back what they've lost, but they have still, they can maybe forge a better world than what they had come to know. Whereas with magical girl anime and, or magical girl cartoons and Western things, I think they still deal with like a lot of pretty dark things, like at least in Star Wars is the forces of evil. Steven universe also has a lot of very dark, truly upsetting things. Poor Steven. I just want to protect him. And he just wants to protect everyone he loves and everyone he knows. And a lot of shit has gone down and all of this, but it's still not quite as hopeless. I think as at least some of the magical girl genre or Maho Shodra that I enjoy. Yeah. I feel like it's a lot more bittersweet. Like so much bad stuff has happened that, you know, I'm, I'm willing to go forward and give you example of like, for them, I guess. Yeah, it's not just like sugarcoated cutesy stuff that doesn't really, you know, doesn't really impact you. It's just like fun to watch. It's, it's like, there's a lot of real life things that go on. And it's, it's just good writing. And what else is there to talk about? I feel like I, I, we, I kind of regret because I think we talked about our like conclusion stuff before, before I got to what I wanted to talk about. What else did you want to talk about? But I wanted to talk about how Western shows different, differ from our Mahou Shoujo, particularly with Miraculous Ladybug. I wanted to bring that up because I adore this show as well. Yeah. While I don't, from what we've seen so far, it does not go into as deep themes as we were just talking about with Steven Universe or Star vs. the Force of Evil or She-Ra or whatever. Although it does, but it's much more in a personal, interpersonal and like familial way, especially with Adrian and his, his, his father. Yeah, it seems a little more lighthearted, but I'm going to, I'm going to quickly, I'm going to quickly give a brief kind of synopsis sort of thing of this real quick. Miraculous Ladybug features these two kids and it's a French animated show. So you can watch it in the sub or the dub. Dub takes a little bit of getting used to, but I genuinely enjoyed it. And the French sub is like really cute, but it's these two kids and they go to school together. They don't really know each other that well. One of them is Marinette and the other one is Adrian. And Marinette is kind of an awkward, kind of clumsy girl, but she's like silly and goofy, but not like she has personality. She's not necessarily like the every girl who is just average on all accounts. And then Adrian is the very popular boy, but he's also very humble. He's also a supermodel. It's fine. They're like 14. It's okay. And they both, both have these magical items. Marinette has little earrings and Adrian has a ring that helps them transform into Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir. And they are the like superheroes of good luck, good luck, and also bad luck. And they fight together to get rid of these butterflies who infect people and like bring out their like fears or hatred or whatever, turn them into monsters. So the thing with this show that is so, wonderfully addictive is that it is a love square, which I just like absolutely fucking adore. Okay. So Marinette is in love with Adrian because she thinks he's so cool. And like, he's like very cute and everything. Adrian doesn't really know Marinette. He, she's like kind of weird, but like they're friends, I guess. Meanwhile, Cat Noir is absolutely in love with Ladybug. So Adrian is in love with Ladybug and, and Ladybug is in love with Adrian, but they don't know it because it's flipped. And so every time like Cat Noir is with Ladybug, he just like was trying to get her attention. And every time Ladybug or Marinette is with Adrian, she's trying to get his attention, but Adrian doesn't get Marinette and Marinette doesn't get Cat Noir. And it's just like, it's just a lot, but it's very, very cute. And this whole show hinges on secret identities because they both don't know like if the other one or their friends are going to accept them. If they know that they're superheroes, so they're juggling the high school and the superhero aspect of it constantly. And then there's like the big evil villain and we don't really know like who he is. And Marinette is kind of dealing with her friend who is a blogger and this mean girl who loves, who loves Ladybug, but hates Marinette. And then like Adrian has issues with his father and his mom died and there's just a lot going on, but it's not so much tragedy and stuff. It's still like, they are magical girls. They transform with their magical identity. Items into their superhero selves, but it's very much superhero tropes of like, how will they figure out my secret identity? But magical girl things of like, oh no, I need to finish my math homework, but there's a demon like evilized Akuma outside. What are we going to do? And it's very, very cute. And that's, that's my spiel. Everyone should watch it. It's all on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I wanted to talk about with that though. Cause I think the other differences in Western shows we've kind of touched on but definitely a lot of magical girl cartoons take more of the superhero route. They kind of do blend together sometimes. And in Mahou Shoujo, they call them superheroes sometimes, but it's very much, they mean different things culturally, especially in like magical girl cartoons where they have superhero costumes and like people know who they, who the superheroes like personas are, but then they have to very much keep it kind of under wraps. There are, there is an element of secret identities in Mahou Shoujo, I think, but it's a, it's a little less, it's less like, oh no, what if the world knows that I'm miraculous lady bug versus like Mahou Shoujo being like, oh no, what if this cute boy I like knows like what, who I am in my superhero suit? They were like, what, that I fight aliens and that I'm really like really weird. So it kind of takes on a more like global sphere in magical girl cartoons in the West.
