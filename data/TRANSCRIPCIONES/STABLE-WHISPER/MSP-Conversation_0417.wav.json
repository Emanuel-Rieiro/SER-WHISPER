{"text": " It's Mark. Nemi. And Wayne. Wayne, thanks for sitting in. Our main host, Ian Freeman, is off talking to a bunch of people who probably pretty much hate him and don't want to hear from him. He went to a city council meeting, and I guess there's something to do with the common closing it down. I don't know entirely. Whatever it is, he's playing with bureaucrats this evening. So it's us, just us, doing our thing here. 855-450-3733. At least he's not in the slammer. Yeah, right. This particular time. The evening is still young. That's right. That's right. We don't know for sure yet what's going to happen. But, you know, all the luck in the world to him. I'm not a big believer in participatory democracies actually carrying what you have to say. It's just me. But you can go to freetalklive.com, check out the website we have there for you. It is user-controlled. Just like the show, you can call in and talk about what you want. You can go to the website and link to blog posts or videos or news stories that you like. Other people will vote your submissions up or vote them down. You can do the same to theirs. Lots of eyes on the website there. A whole bunch of visits per month. I was very, very surprised. Go to freetalklive.com. You know, Wayne, we both have the same story this evening. And it is a disturbing one. It's a story about, well, streetlights. New streetlights. And the one I've got is from Infowars.com. Who, you know, some people will dismiss as a conspiracy-type website. But, frankly, I have yet to find them be inaccurate on anything. They tend to be cutting edge on some stuff. And, you know, maybe some things don't come to fruition. But here we go. The applications, including speaker systems, motion sensors, and video surveillance, are now being rolled out with the aid of government funding. So that means the streetlight can watch you, talk to you, and, you know, see what you're doing. You knew this was coming. This is like the all-in-one printer, fax machine, and scanner. Yeah. Only this has that Big Brother smack to it. Yes. Ridiculous digital infrastructure. SIC. What is that? S-I-C, when they put it into something. That's what it says. SIC. I don't know. I think it's Latin for that's their mistake, not mine. Right. Infrastructure that allows streetlights to be controlled remotely by means of a ubiquitous Wi-Fi-linked and miniature computer housed in each streetlight. So do they talk to each other in little cells, like the Wi-Fi jumps from one to the next? Just like the voting machines. Yeah, right. Great. Housed in each streetlight, allowing for security, energy management, data harvesting, and digital media, according to the Illuminating Concepts website. According to the company's YouTube video, the concept, the primary capabilities of the devices include energy conservation. That seems like a good thing. Homeland security. Hmm. I wonder what they mean. Public safety. How do streetlights keep us safe? I suppose they could light things. Traffic control. Advertising. What? Video surveillance. Homeland security applications. Each of the light poles contains a speaker system that can be used to broadcast emergency alerts or say, citizen, move along. I guess the mafia won't be dumping dead bodies on the side of the road anymore. Right. Not where these things are. The primary capabilities of the devices include, excuse me, in terms of homeland security applications, each of the light poles contains a speaker system that can be used to broadcast emergency alerts as well as display that transmits security levels, presuming a similar system to the DHS's. Maligned color-coded terror alert designation. So it'll tell you just how dangerous the neighborhood is, I guess. In addition to showing instructions by the way of this LED video screen, the lights also include proximity sensors that can record both pedestrian and road traffic. The video display and speaker systems will also be used to transmit minority report style advertising. You know, in the movie, one of the things that I liked the very best about the movie is it, you know, said, hello, Wayne. It is good to see you. And that it would, you know, broadcast advertising directly to you. You know, advertising for 50-year-old males was, who are in shape and that kind of thing. You know, it'd give you, it'd broadcast your Tahitian nani juice ad right there. And your natural Viagra. Right. Those things. You know, the things that are, because, you know, I mean, what a waste of an ad to advertise to somebody, you know, to send you, you know, an ad for something with, with an artificial sweetener in it or, you know, a feminine product. What's a, what a waste of time. Some guys might want a feminine product. Not that I would, but some might, you know. I don't know what they would do with it. They probably know, though. If the guy's a cross-dresser, they would know about it if they've got all that data. Yeah. It could very well be. Well, we, this article does go on, but I want to step down, take a call here. We've got Buck from Alabama. Let's go to Buck. Buck? Can you hear me now, Buck? Yep, I'm here. Hey, what's going on? What's on your mind? Not much. How about yourself? I'm just calling in, actually, just on a recommendation from my friend for some good conversation. Just wanted to know your thoughts on the American military, both historically and in our current situation today, the war on terror. Well, I guess, I guess you'd have to. I know that, I understand that's a pretty broad question. Yeah, it's a broad question. Why don't you start out, why don't you start out generally by, do you agree with America having as large a military as we have? I mean, it is, granted, smaller than it's ever been in the past three decades, but do you agree with the general concept of having the army to defend the nation? The military's smaller than it's been in the past three decades right now? Sure. Oh, I wouldn't know. I thought that Clinton downsized it in the late 90s. Clinton downsized it in the late 90s, but it's smaller than it's been in the past three decades now. I'm going to go ahead and take your word on that. I have no idea whether or not that's true, Buck. It's also difficult to know how that measurement's being made. Is it based on personnel? Because, you see, nowadays they use a lot more contractors that aren't considered troops, but they're still there shooting on behalf of the United States. So it's very difficult to actually say something's big or small. American diplomats that may be in the interest of the United States for policy, but they're not American military personnel. But they have used, you would agree, Buck, that they do use contractors for military operations and things like that, right? I mean, what do you consider military operations? I guess shooting bad guys. Yeah, killing people. Military operations? Shooting bad guys? Shooting bad guys, sure. I mean, you know, we need to protect our diplomats over there, so we hire private contractors. But it's not the same thing as the American military. It's not troops fighting for a flag. Okay, I mean... Do you understand my point? I don't... No, actually, I really can't tell the difference. I mean, a guy with a gun does what he's told. It sounds the same to me. Pardon me, sir. I don't mean to interrupt you. I really don't. But you can't understand the difference between a fella who's a hired gun and someone who is serving in the United States Armed Forces. No, I can't, because a guy who's serving in the United States Armed Forces is a hired gun. Serving in the United States Armed Forces is a hired gun. With all due respect, my friend, there is a difference between wanting to take up a gun and actively protect your nation and being a hired gun. Well, what would you constitute protecting a nation? What would you constitute protecting a nation? Nothing that's happened in the last 70 years. Exactly. Wait, I'm sorry. Nothing that has happened in the last 70 years in protecting the nation. Very little. I'll go with very little. Surely there is a military man in the last 70 years that has done something. Both my grandfather's fought in World War II. Nothing that has happened in the past 70 years... Isn't... Okay, isn't the last... I was trying to exempt... Buck, I was trying to exempt World War II because I think that it is a war that is too easy to defend. I can... You know, we can have the argument about World War II, but I'd really like to have everything that happened from 1946 on was really what I was trying to point out. 1946 on. Okay, fair enough. We'll... Hold the line here, Buck. We'll bring you right back. 855-450-3733. You're on Free Talk Live. Looks like it's going to be, well, I don't know, peaceniks versus warmongers. I don't know. Free Talk Live, 855-450-FREE. It's a cycle toll-free call-in line here on the live Wednesday night edition of Free Talk Live with Mark. Nemi. And Wayne. You can call in, take control of the airwaves. That's what we do here on Free Talk Live. The Ruger has a new SR-40C. It's a compact version of the Recon. Coil-reducing, striker-fired SR-40 pistol. One of the slimmest, most ergonomic, full-sized .40 caliber pistols on the market today. The Ruger SR-40C is based on the same high-performance, glass-filled, nylon frame as those used on so many great Ruger pistols, offering the same features, including a slim frame, short trigger reach, reversible backstrap, amni-dexterous controls. The SR-40C features a throw-hardened stainless steel slide or an alloy steel slide with a Nitro-Dox pro-black finish. You can see it at Ruger.com and purchase it at your local gun dealer. It is, again, the SR-40C at Ruger.com. So, Buck, you there? Buck? Hello? Hey, Buck. So, Buck, it looks like a friend of yours is trying to lead us both down the Primrose path. They had you call in to Free Talk Live to, you know, talk about sort of military things. And we've, you know, had the exchange here. I just, I made a statement, which was, I guess, factually inaccurate from, well, not factually inaccurate, inaccurate in what I wanted to say. I wanted to say that everything that's happened since World War II has largely been a misuse of the United States military. I said 70 years. It's 66. So, I hope you'll forgive me if you would react. Absolutely, absolutely. I was cut off a little quickly there. I heard you say when you probably thought I was off the line, guess it looks like it's going to be a little bit more. The peace lovers versus warmongers. I said peaceniks. Peaceniks. Maybe peacekeepers. I'm sorry. No, peaceniks. Peaceniks. I was, what I was trying to do. Yeah, I said peaceniks versus warmongers. And what I was trying to do is use sort of colloquial self-effacing terms on both sides in order to, you know, make it a compelling conversation. Go ahead, Buck. All right, all right. Well taken. Well, perhaps we better start this from a level ground there. If you said everything that has happened, after 1946, has been a misuse of the United States military. Largely or something like that, yeah. What would you say, in its most basic definition, the United States military was created to do? What would you say is an appropriate use of the United States military? Perhaps you could give me a historical example or just a conceptual view of what you think the purpose of the United States military is. Well, I guess that it's, you know, most accurately what a military is for. And the founding fathers were pretty much against many of the founding fathers were against a standing military in general. They felt that they were, they would always be misused, that they would be used to, you know, create empire, that they would be extraordinarily expensive, that they were more dangerous to liberty than pretty much anything else except perhaps a central bank. And I would, but I would say if you're going to have one, Alexander Hamilton, you know, the sort of the early big government guy, he really wanted himself a military. And, you know, that's what happened. I would say if, in General Smedley Butler, the two-time Medal of Honor winner, actually it should have been three, he was, but at the time they wouldn't give Medals of Honor to officers. So two-time, but practically speaking, three-time Medal of Honor winner. He suggested that the military only be, the army only be kept on U.S. soil and that the Navy only be within 500 miles of the coastline. Now, I don't know if that's practical today, but I would say that the, you know, land-based military should probably be on U.S. soil and then, you know, the ships can, they can go around in the oceans wherever they want to go. Okay. That's, I don't want to insult what you said. It's pretty general there, though. Yes, you're correct. Many of the founding fathers were extraordinarily uneasy about having a standing military. I mean, Jefferson alone, I think, really epitomizes their views. Of course, you can probably empathize with them as well, considering that they had just fought a revolution against British troops that they would have once considered friendly. I mean, King George essentially sent the troops over to, as he would have seen it, enforce order in the colonies and really just collect taxes. So, to me, it's pretty understandable why some of the founding fathers, really the Republican founding fathers, would have been uneasy about having a standing military because with the executive under the Constitution having both the power of the purse and the sword, they probably just saw the military as a device that the executive could use to collect taxes. Do you think that... I think you can argue both ways, however, that the President of the United States does not use the United States military to collect taxes. I mean, clearly, the military has got a much, much more specific and larger purpose here. And, I mean, in this war on terror, will you at least agree with me that there are insurgents out there, that there are rogue states, and that there are rapids that are actively growing nations that pose a threat to the United States of America, and that we need to be both pragmatic and, in some scenarios, preemptive with our tactics to ensure our national security? Why is that? Look what's happening in Libya. Look what's happening in Iraq right now, in Afghanistan. They're radicalizing these people. They're not becoming more peaceful towards the United States. I'm sorry. Listen here, partner. We invaded, to use your word, Afghanistan because the Taliban had imposed military rule on the entire country. Who funded the Taliban? Well, hold on just a second, Buck. Who funded the Taliban? Whose business... Lots of places have imposed military rule on lots of countries. That's not a good reason. The United States didn't go into... We did not go into Afghanistan, partner, because of that. We went into Afghanistan because they refused to turn over Osama bin Laden, whom they did not have, on George Bush's say-so, without any evidence whatsoever that he had committed a crime. Like Bush. You don't like me calling you partner. Well, partner, listen. I'm not disagreeing with you yet on anything. The only thing I want to say right now is that you said the United States military went into Afghanistan, and there were no radicals in Afghanistan prior to our invasion. Now, I don't know... No, no, no. We're not saying there were none, but the country wasn't run by them. We were firmly implanted in that country long before we invaded, as with Iraq as well. Well, why are they taking over then now? Saddam Hussein just exacerbated the wars between smaller factions that had originally been suppressed by his dictatorship. So, Buck, here's what my contention is. The United States military is used in a fashion, and they will follow whatever orders they're told to, even though they take some oath to the Constitution, and there hasn't been a declared war since 1940. They'll continue to do whatever the president says, and they're generals and whatever. They'll do these things. And their actions result in things like 9-11. The terrorists themselves say that the United States military presence in the Middle East is one of their big problems, and of course the Jews and Israel and all that stuff. And don't you think... Wouldn't you act in a militant fashion if there were... A militant fashion if, say, there were attacking, occupying forces here in the United States? Military base in Texas? Yeah. Yep. I'm sorry. I'm only getting every other word of what you're saying, but I'll go back to the last thing that I heard. Thanks for the call here, Buck. I do appreciate it. Give us a call sometime in the...

A segment is just kind of the way I'm taught in the radio business that, you know, it's one thing to hold somebody through to another segment, but a third one. Now I'm beginning to regret it. He was such a good caller, and we were talking about this. It was still compelling us to speak about it during the break. And to me, that means that he was probably quite good, and I hope Buck calls in in the future because I really enjoyed discussing these things with him.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.44,

Nemi. And Wayne. Wayne, thanks for sitting in. Our main host, Ian Freeman, is off talking to a bunch of people who probably pretty much hate him and don't want to hear from him. He went to a city council meeting, and I guess there's something to do with the common closing it down. I don't know entirely. Whatever it is, he's playing with bureaucrats this evening. So it's us, just us, doing our thing here. 855-450-3733. At least he's not in the slammer. Yeah, right. This particular time. The evening is still young. That's right. That's right. We don't know for sure yet what's going to happen. But, you know, all the luck in the world to him. I'm not a big believer in participatory democracies actually carrying what you have to say. It's just me. But you can go to freetalklive.com, check out the website we have there for you. It is user-controlled. Just like the show, you can call in and talk about what you want. You can go to the website and link to blog posts or videos or news stories that you like. Other people will vote your submissions up or vote them down. You can do the same to theirs. Lots of eyes on the website there. A whole bunch of visits per month. I was very, very surprised. Go to freetalklive.com. You know, Wayne, we both have the same story this evening. And it is a disturbing one. It's a story about, well, streetlights. New streetlights. And the one I've got is from Infowars.com. Who, you know, some people will dismiss as a conspiracy-type website. But, frankly, I have yet to find them be inaccurate on anything. They tend to be cutting edge on some stuff. And, you know, maybe some things don't come to fruition. But here we go. The applications, including speaker systems, motion sensors, and video surveillance, are now being rolled out with the aid of government funding. So that means the streetlight can watch you, talk to you, and, you know, see what you're doing. You knew this was coming. This is like the all-in-one printer, fax machine, and scanner. Yeah. Only this has that Big Brother smack to it. Yes. Ridiculous digital infrastructure. SIC. What is that? S-I-C, when they put it into something. That's what it says. SIC. I don't know. I think it's Latin for that's their mistake, not mine. Right. Infrastructure that allows streetlights to be controlled remotely by means of a ubiquitous Wi-Fi-linked and miniature computer housed in each streetlight. So do they talk to each other in little cells, like the Wi-Fi jumps from one to the next? Just like the voting machines. Yeah, right. Great. Housed in each streetlight, allowing for security, energy management, data harvesting, and digital media, according to the Illuminating Concepts website. According to the company's YouTube video, the concept, the primary capabilities of the devices include energy conservation. That seems like a good thing. Homeland security. Hmm. I wonder what they mean. Public safety. How do streetlights keep us safe? I suppose they could light things. Traffic control. Advertising. What? Video surveillance. Homeland security applications. Each of the light poles contains a speaker system that can be used to broadcast emergency alerts or say, citizen, move along. I guess the mafia won't be dumping dead bodies on the side of the road anymore. Right. Not where these things are. The primary capabilities of the devices include, excuse me, in terms of homeland security applications, each of the light poles contains a speaker system that can be used to broadcast emergency alerts as well as display that transmits security levels, presuming a similar system to the DHS's. Maligned color-coded terror alert designation. So it'll tell you just how dangerous the neighborhood is, I guess. In addition to showing instructions by the way of this LED video screen, the lights also include proximity sensors that can record both pedestrian and road traffic. The video display and speaker systems will also be used to transmit minority report style advertising. You know, in the movie, one of the things that I liked the very best about the movie is it, you know, said, hello, Wayne. It is good to see you. And that it would, you know, broadcast advertising directly to you. You know, advertising for 50-year-old males was, who are in shape and that kind of thing. You know, it'd give you, it'd broadcast your Tahitian nani juice ad right there. And your natural Viagra. Right. Those things. You know, the things that are, because, you know, I mean, what a waste of an ad to advertise to somebody, you know, to send you, you know, an ad for something with, with an artificial sweetener in it or, you know, a feminine product. What's a, what a waste of time. Some guys might want a feminine product. Not that I would, but some might, you know. I don't know what they would do with it. They probably know, though. If the guy's a cross-dresser, they would know about it if they've got all that data. Yeah. It could very well be. Well, we, this article does go on, but I want to step down, take a call here. We've got Buck from Alabama. Let's go to Buck. Buck? Can you hear me now, Buck? Yep, I'm here. Hey, what's going on? What's on your mind? Not much. How about yourself? I'm just calling in, actually, just on a recommendation from my friend for some good conversation. Just wanted to know your thoughts on the American military, both historically and in our current situation today, the war on terror. Well, I guess, I guess you'd have to. I know that, I understand that's a pretty broad question. Yeah, it's a broad question. Why don't you start out, why don't you start out generally by, do you agree with America having as large a military as we have? I mean, it is, granted, smaller than it's ever been in the past three decades, but do you agree with the general concept of having the army to defend the nation? The military's smaller than it's been in the past three decades right now? Sure. Oh, I wouldn't know. I thought that Clinton downsized it in the late 90s. Clinton downsized it in the late 90s, but it's smaller than it's been in the past three decades now. I'm going to go ahead and take your word on that. I have no idea whether or not that's true, Buck. It's also difficult to know how that measurement's being made. Is it based on personnel? Because, you see, nowadays they use a lot more contractors that aren't considered troops, but they're still there shooting on behalf of the United States. So it's very difficult to actually say something's big or small. American diplomats that may be in the interest of the United States for policy, but they're not American military personnel. But they have used, you would agree, Buck, that they do use contractors for military operations and things like that, right? I mean, what do you consider military operations? I guess shooting bad guys. Yeah, killing people. Military operations? Shooting bad guys? Shooting bad guys, sure. I mean, you know, we need to protect our diplomats over there, so we hire private contractors. But it's not the same thing as the American military. It's not troops fighting for a flag. Okay, I mean... Do you understand my point? I don't... No, actually, I really can't tell the difference. I mean, a guy with a gun does what he's told. It sounds the same to me. Pardon me, sir. I don't mean to interrupt you. I really don't. But you can't understand the difference between a fella who's a hired gun and someone who is serving in the United States Armed Forces. No, I can't, because a guy who's serving in the United States Armed Forces is a hired gun. Serving in the United States Armed Forces is a hired gun. With all due respect, my friend, there is a difference between wanting to take up a gun and actively protect your nation and being a hired gun. Well, what would you constitute protecting a nation? What would you constitute protecting a nation? Nothing that's happened in the last 70 years. Exactly. Wait, I'm sorry. Nothing that has happened in the last 70 years in protecting the nation. Very little. I'll go with very little. Surely there is a military man in the last 70 years that has done something. Both my grandfather's fought in World War II. Nothing that has happened in the past 70 years... Isn't... Okay, isn't the last... I was trying to exempt... Buck, I was trying to exempt World War II because I think that it is a war that is too easy to defend. I can... You know, we can have the argument about World War II, but I'd really like to have everything that happened from 1946 on was really what I was trying to point out. 1946 on. Okay, fair enough. We'll... Hold the line here, Buck. We'll bring you right back. 855-450-3733. You're on Free Talk Live. Looks like it's going to be, well, I don't know, peaceniks versus warmongers. I don't know. Free Talk Live, 855-450-FREE. It's a cycle toll-free call-in line here on the live Wednesday night edition of Free Talk Live with Mark. Nemi. And Wayne. You can call in, take control of the airwaves. That's what we do here on Free Talk Live. The Ruger has a new SR-40C. It's a compact version of the Recon. Coil-reducing, striker-fired SR-40 pistol. One of the slimmest, most ergonomic, full-sized .40 caliber pistols on the market today. The Ruger SR-40C is based on the same high-performance, glass-filled, nylon frame as those used on so many great Ruger pistols, offering the same features, including a slim frame, short trigger reach, reversible backstrap, amni-dexterous controls. The SR-40C features a throw-hardened stainless steel slide or an alloy steel slide with a Nitro-Dox pro-black finish. You can see it at Ruger.com and purchase it at your local gun dealer. It is, again, the SR-40C at Ruger.com. So, Buck, you there? Buck? Hello? Hey, Buck. So, Buck, it looks like a friend of yours is trying to lead us both down the Primrose path. They had you call in to Free Talk Live to, you know, talk about sort of military things. And we've, you know, had the exchange here. I just, I made a statement, which was, I guess, factually inaccurate from, well, not factually inaccurate, inaccurate in what I wanted to say. I wanted to say that everything that's happened since World War II has largely been a misuse of the United States military. I said 70 years. It's 66. So, I hope you'll forgive me if you would react. Absolutely, absolutely. I was cut off a little quickly there. I heard you say when you probably thought I was off the line, guess it looks like it's going to be a little bit more. The peace lovers versus warmongers. I said peaceniks. Peaceniks. Maybe peacekeepers. I'm sorry. No, peaceniks. Peaceniks. I was, what I was trying to do. Yeah, I said peaceniks versus warmongers. And what I was trying to do is use sort of colloquial self-effacing terms on both sides in order to, you know, make it a compelling conversation. Go ahead, Buck. All right, all right. Well taken. Well, perhaps we better start this from a level ground there. If you said everything that has happened, after 1946, has been a misuse of the United States military. Largely or something like that, yeah. What would you say, in its most basic definition, the United States military was created to do? What would you say is an appropriate use of the United States military? Perhaps you could give me a historical example or just a conceptual view of what you think the purpose of the United States military is. Well, I guess that it's, you know, most accurately what a military is for. And the founding fathers were pretty much against many of the founding fathers were against a standing military in general. They felt that they were, they would always be misused, that they would be used to, you know, create empire, that they would be extraordinarily expensive, that they were more dangerous to liberty than pretty much anything else except perhaps a central bank. And I would, but I would say if you're going to have one, Alexander Hamilton, you know, the sort of the early big government guy, he really wanted himself a military. And, you know, that's what happened. I would say if, in General Smedley Butler, the two-time Medal of Honor winner, actually it should have been three, he was, but at the time they wouldn't give Medals of Honor to officers. So two-time, but practically speaking, three-time Medal of Honor winner. He suggested that the military only be, the army only be kept on U.S. soil and that the Navy only be within 500 miles of the coastline. Now, I don't know if that's practical today, but I would say that the, you know, land-based military should probably be on U.S. soil and then, you know, the ships can, they can go around in the oceans wherever they want to go. Okay. That's, I don't want to insult what you said. It's pretty general there, though. Yes, you're correct. Many of the founding fathers were extraordinarily uneasy about having a standing military. I mean, Jefferson alone, I think, really epitomizes their views. Of course, you can probably empathize with them as well, considering that they had just fought a revolution against British troops that they would have once considered friendly. I mean, King George essentially sent the troops over to, as he would have seen it, enforce order in the colonies and really just collect taxes. So, to me, it's pretty understandable why some of the founding fathers, really the Republican founding fathers, would have been uneasy about having a standing military because with the executive under the Constitution having both the power of the purse and the sword, they probably just saw the military as a device that the executive could use to collect taxes. Do you think that... I think you can argue both ways, however, that the President of the United States does not use the United States military to collect taxes. I mean, clearly, the military has got a much, much more specific and larger purpose here. And, I mean, in this war on terror, will you at least agree with me that there are insurgents out there, that there are rogue states, and that there are rapids that are actively growing nations that pose a threat to the United States of America, and that we need to be both pragmatic and, in some scenarios, preemptive with our tactics to ensure our national security? Why is that? Look what's happening in Libya. Look what's happening in Iraq right now, in Afghanistan. They're radicalizing these people. They're not becoming more peaceful towards the United States. I'm sorry. Listen here, partner. We invaded, to use your word, Afghanistan because the Taliban had imposed military rule on the entire country. Who funded the Taliban? Well, hold on just a second, Buck. Who funded the Taliban? Whose business... Lots of places have imposed military rule on lots of countries. That's not a good reason. The United States didn't go into... We did not go into Afghanistan, partner, because of that. We went into Afghanistan because they refused to turn over Osama bin Laden, whom they did not have, on George Bush's say-so, without any evidence whatsoever that he had committed a crime. Like Bush. You don't like me calling you partner. Well, partner, listen. I'm not disagreeing with you yet on anything. The only thing I want to say right now is that you said the United States military went into Afghanistan, and there were no radicals in Afghanistan prior to our invasion. Now, I don't know... No, no, no. We're not saying there were none, but the country wasn't run by them. We were firmly implanted in that country long before we invaded, as with Iraq as well. Well, why are they taking over then now? Saddam Hussein just exacerbated the wars between smaller factions that had originally been suppressed by his dictatorship. So, Buck, here's what my contention is. The United States military is used in a fashion, and they will follow whatever orders they're told to, even though they take some oath to the Constitution, and there hasn't been a declared war since 1940. They'll continue to do whatever the president says, and they're generals and whatever. They'll do these things. And their actions result in things like 9-11. The terrorists themselves say that the United States military presence in the Middle East is one of their big problems, and of course the Jews and Israel and all that stuff. And don't you think... Wouldn't you act in a militant fashion if there were... A militant fashion if, say, there were attacking, occupying forces here in the United States? Military base in Texas? Yeah. Yep. I'm sorry. I'm only getting every other word of what you're saying, but I'll go back to the last thing that I heard. Thanks for the call here, Buck. I do appreciate it. Give us a call sometime in the...

A segment is just kind of the way I'm taught in the radio business that, you know, it's one thing to hold somebody through to another segment, but a third one. Now I'm beginning to regret it. He was such a good caller, and we were talking about this. It was still compelling us to speak about it during the break. And to me, that means that he was probably quite good, and I hope Buck calls in in the future because I really enjoyed discussing these things with him.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end":
