{"text": " Have you heard of benching? Ooh. That sounds trampy. That's, you know, drinking on a bench together. Yeah, it's not actually having some kind of liaison on a bench. But, yeah. Is it where you park somebody for later? Yes. That's what it'll be. Exactly. Like you're benched. They're on the bench. So you can join the team in a bit when I'm, you know, when I'm feeling tired. In the audience, cheer. How many of you knew what benching was? Woo. Oh. One very kind of... Guilty person. Yeah, clued up kind of person. Now, this is my favourite one, actually. Have you heard of Marley-ing? Marley-ing? Oh, is that... Are we back to Christmas Carol? We are back to Christmas ghosts. Ah. Yes. So, A, like the ghost of... So, does anyone in the audience know this? Marley. So, it's basically, it's when you get in touch with your ex suddenly out of the blue at Christmas. Oh. Oh. That's perfect. Nice. Just feeling a bit lonely for the holidays. So, there we go. Anyway, back to marriage. Yeah, I kind of have... I guess I have strange feelings about marriage because, obviously, I mean, being a gay woman for many years, that was just not something available at all. And then when, I guess, loads of my friends were getting really excited about the fact that we could, I was like, oh, you know, why do we even want to kind of buy into... It's very gross. ...a sort of patriarchal institution. Yeah. But then, equally, there is something... I'm very conflicted because there's something appealing about it and also just practically quite beneficial as well. I mean... Well, very practically beneficial. Me and my fella, I know, I've been with the same man now for, what, nine years? It's too long. It's too long. But, yeah, we're going to... The plan is to get civil partnered in the year because I refuse to... I refuse to get married because, similarly, it's just disgusting. Well, it really is. It's just a terrible thing. See, I quite like funerals. They're all right. Because you're allowed to be sad and faking sadness is much easier than faking delight. And it's... Also, what's really good about funerals is the food is there. So, you go to a wake and there's food immediately. You don't have to piss about speaking to aunts and uncles you don't care about. So, there's that sort of thing. But the actual... If you look at what they're doing, you're selling a lady. Hooray! Let's sell a lady, everybody. Let's dress her up and pretend she's never had sex and walk her down the aisle and her father can sell her to there. And, look, there's another bloke there who'll do if the groom doesn't turn up. No. It's weird. It's proper weird. It really is weird when I think about the fact that some of my family are here and the last time I ever saw them was a wedding in 1987. There we go. Very strange indeed. It's just... I just... I mean, the equivalent is... Imagine going to an employer and part of your job interview was they looked in your mouth. That's the equivalent. It's just... It's icky. But you look lovely on a wedding day and I'd love the photos and you're so sweet. But no. It's... Yeah. I don't like the way it sets up one kind of relationship is so much more important than all others. And I think that's my issue. And that's my issue with break-up as well because we don't really have that language for friends or colleagues. And I feel like a lot of the problems with romantic love is because culturally we put so much pressure on it to be so many things for us, which is really quite a new thing historically. Of course, yes. To be like they've got to be our best friend and our cheerleader and the carer when we're sick and have kids with them. And, you know, often like to the exclusion, I think you were saying last week, how that, you know, often that friendships, you know, die down and like, you know, it's all about that partnership. And I think that puts those relationships under huge amount of pressure. It's why a lot of people stay in damaging relationships because they think they can't get out of them. It's also why a lot of people kind of go from one person to another because it's never going to be good enough because there's so much pressure. But if like we were dismantling that hierarchy and seeing all the relationships in our lives as equally important and putting a lot more time and effort into all of them across the board, I think that we'd be in a better place. So that's why I'm not keen on the whole marriage thing and also have some problems around the whole break-up thing because it's like, why aren't we treating all relationships as equally special and equally worthy of celebrating and marking the ending? Yes. That's good to say. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Oh no, I mean. And that is why never ever go out with MJ at Valentine's Day. You'll be disappointed. Oh, I'm romantic. Oh, are you? Oh, I am, yes. That did not sound romantic. That sounded very. With friends also. You can get my romantic anti-romance rant and then I will give you a flower. But what you're, what you're, what you're talking about is, kind of falls under the banner of relationship anarchy, which is kind of, well, kind of term for sort of really doing away with those hierarchies and celebrating and valuing friendships and other types of relationships. In one of my radio pieces, I called it a new currency of commitment, but it's about kind of redistributing that value that we place on relationships, isn't it? But what was fun was actually the one relationship anarchy meeting I went to when you were there, actually, and we had a chat. Yes. I just thought what was brilliant was it was a relationship anarchy meeting and I thought we're going to be just tearing up the patriarchy and it was the most organised meeting I've ever been to. We like queued, you know, until the room was ready and then we had an agenda. Yes. And it was like really kind of quite strict and regimented. It doesn't have to be this way. No, I know. But I just thought it was perhaps a slight irony. It wasn't very anarchist, was it? No, not really. But yeah, this idea of that. But I love that kind of principle. Yeah, I mean, relationship anarchy, you know, it's about valuing different relationships. Evenly and also the sense of the people being free. So it's kind of getting away from that kind of belonging idea. And yeah, like intentional relationships is another way of putting it if you don't want the anarchy word in there. But yeah, Justin and I talk about it quite a lot on our podcast. Just to give that a plug. Oh, yes. Meg, John and Justin. Meg, John and Justin.com. You can get a little worksheet so you can figure out how to do your relationships online if you want to. That's a bit too organised as well, isn't it? That sounds like. Yeah. Well, you have to. Or you can just listen to the podcast while you're working out. Some people say it's funny. If you're polyamorous, you have to be organised, don't you? If you are having multiple. But I don't like this idea either. This is why, you know, I mean, yeah, like, yeah. I mean, no, you don't. Because like, it's about, it's about having friendships. Exactly. You don't have to. A lot of polyamorous people do like have, you know, ridiculous spreadsheets and like calendars, colour coded. And I have been there. I have done that. But like, you don't have to. And again, I like this idea that if we just treat all our relationships as equally important and we're maybe not saying partnerships is a special thing where we have to do like dates every da-da-da and have the calendar. It would be good. I mean, I'm not talking, I still sort of, it would be nice to be able to have sex with one person, to have finances with another person, to have dinner with another person. Yeah. I mean, it's friendships, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, that's what I find. I find a lot of the kind of like relationships I have are with my friends more than anyone. Oh, definitely. And you can see what works with them, right? Yeah, exactly. And do those things. I talk about, I talk about love affairs. And it's really placing this value on that particular central person. Yeah. I feel like I have like with my friends, I have everything with them that I would have in a relationship except for sex. But like with all of my close friends, I mean, I have a good group of them and I have so much love and affinity for them. Well, I think you could be polyamorous and just be having sex with one person or having sex with no people. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Solo poly is another thing where people value their relationship with themselves. You know, that's, that's their primary relationship. And some people are asexual as well and might have multiple loving relationships. Yeah, which, you know, and that's again where non-monogamy opens up the option for like to have, not have sexual relationships, but they might be platonic, they might be romantic or platonic relationships. You know, I think this diversity of language that we get now around, you know, the different versions of asexuality and aromantic and different versions of polyamory and, you know, it just opens this whole territory up for people to find out what works for them instead of feeling like shoved into this mold that you're talking about. Yeah. This old. Patriarchal mold. But even though, I mean, we sort of say that, right, I'm just going to give a slight defense. My co-presenter on Making History is called Tom Holland. He's got this amazing book called Dominion, which is basically explaining how Christian we still are, even though we don't believe in God. And what's really interesting when you look at it is we sort of have this idea that, you know, oh, the problem is marriage and the problem is monogamy is enforced and everything else. But previously before that, it wasn't as though in Greek culture and Roman culture, everybody got to have sex with who you wanted. No, rich, powerful men got to have sex with whoever they wanted. Yes. And the rest of us got fucked. And then only if they were, well, it's literally because only if they were active. So if those guys were actually into being recipients, then that would have been found upon. Homosexual relationships were fine as long as you weren't the bottom. Yeah. Literally. Being seen as womanly was bad and being seen as weak was bad. And it wasn't until you had Christianity you actually went, oh, actually, our God is a very, very good God. Weak creature who died, you know, in the way a slave would die. And therefore actually being weak is a good thing. And maybe everybody has virtue and rights and everything like that. And that's where the whole sort of idea comes from. And monogamy is actually a way of protecting weak people. It's for women, really. It sounds really backwards and wrong because it's really patriarchal. But compared to the previous stuff, it's quite good. But it's not good. We can do better. We can do better. We need to move into the future. Yeah, we are. And we are moving into the future, aren't we? And I mean, some of these new terms, I don't really like things like ghosting because a lot of them seem to be kind of defining rather dicky behavior. And actually, we kind of make it sound kind of fun. But I don't know. What do you think about? I mean, I know it's pretentious, but some of the kind of terms that celebrities have used and endorsed like conscious uncoupling. I mean, it sounds icky, but I like the idea. No, definitely. I think it would be great. Again, if we can go away from putting all this pressure on this particular kind of relationship, that's potentially why we have to have all this language around breakup because we're expecting so much from people. And, you know, again, well, I think what you're saying about the dicky behavior as well, it's this weird area, love, where we like we can experience the best of what we're capable of. You know, we can really meet another person and be met ourselves in all of who we are and be kind of present with somebody. So easily drawn into like objectifying someone, making them into something for us, putting them on a pedestal, treating them in unrealistic ways, expecting too much of them in ways that make it impossible to stay. You know, either we stay and go through a lot of turmoil or we end up breaking up. Whereas if we could like have just multiple models for how to do these things and not put so much pressure on. So I guess that's where that kind of conscious and intentional relationship is a cool idea. This is going to make soap operas really boring. Yeah. It's like non-monogamy does, doesn't it? There's no drama here. This is the trouble. There's no smashing of plates. And I can't believe you slept with her. No, you told me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't that be awesome though? We might have energy for other things like, you know, saving the planet. It would be really great. No. Come on now. She's going too far. Sharon, you told me a funny story about ghosting because you did ghost a more casual lover. Oh, God, I forgot I told you that. Because of an unfortunate coincidence about their name. Yeah. So there was this guy and his girlfriend that I was seeing for a bit. And he was so annoying though. I should have dumped him a long time ago. But anyway, he... Oh, so my brother then had a child and named him Omar. And the guy that I was seeing, his name was Omar. So he then called me to be like, oh, do you want to come around? And I was just like, oh, I can't. I'm like, I'm ill. I can't. I'm sorry. And he was like, okay, cool. Like, I'll call you next week. And I was like, okay, bye. And the whole time I was just like, I can't fuck someone with the same name as my nephew. I can't do this. I don't know what to do. And I can't say it out loud because it makes me feel weird. So I was just like, just don't answer the phone. So a week later he called. And he still calls me every now and then. I just don't answer. I've locked his number now. Okay. Because it's just, it's too much now. But like, yeah, I just can't, I can't fuck someone with the same name as my nephew. I've had sex with somebody the same name as my mother. Oh, no, no, no, no. See, I don't have a problem. I don't meet that many. I'm in Orinda's, so I think I'm okay. Oh, dear. You were telling me as well about some kind of quite tricky experiences on the kind of dating apps and stuff as a bi woman. And maybe a bit of biphobia kind of from both sides, perhaps? Yeah, yeah. So I haven't actually been in a relationship with a woman. I've just fucked loads of women. So I kind of, I went on dating apps for a while. My friends downloaded dating apps for me, basically. And I was just like, oh, I guess I'll give it a go. And I hated it instantly. As soon as someone matched with me and messaged me, even if it was like, hey, how are you doing? I'd just be like, I fucking hate you. I just couldn't stand him. I don't know why. There was no reason. And so like, I took interest in you. That's probably the reason. Yeah, and I was just like, how dare you? Yeah. So I just, Lost your respect. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Tell me more about that. Yeah, we need to unpack that. This is for my therapist. Yeah, and what essentially happens to me on dating apps is if I match with a lesbian, they, when they find out I'm bisexual, they think I'm either going through a phase or I'll end up with a guy. And so they unmatch me or they just tell me they're not interested. And then when I match with a guy, they just want me for threesomes or they just want to hear the stories or whatever. So I, as a bisexual woman on dating apps, it's just, I've deleted them all, basically. It's just chaos. It's absolute chaos. So I'm just hoping to just be single forever. MJ, you're shaking your head. Just biphobia.

So, it's basically, it's when you get in touch with your ex suddenly out of the blue at Christmas. Oh. Oh. That's perfect. Nice. Just feeling a bit lonely for the holidays. So, there we go. Anyway, back to marriage. Yeah, I kind of have... I guess I have strange feelings about marriage because, obviously, I mean, being a gay woman for many years, that was just not something available at all. And then when, I guess, loads of my friends were getting really excited about the fact that we could, I was like, oh, you know, why do we even want to kind of buy into... It's very gross. ...a sort of patriarchal institution. Yeah. But then, equally, there is something... I'm very conflicted because there's something appealing about it and also just practically quite beneficial as well. I mean... Well, very practically beneficial. Me and my fella, I know, I've been with the same man now for, what, nine years? It's too long. It's too long. But, yeah, we're going to... The plan is to get civil partnered in the year because I refuse to... I refuse to get married because, similarly, it's just disgusting. Well, it really is. It's just a terrible thing. See, I quite like funerals. They're all right. Because you're allowed to be sad and faking sadness is much easier than faking delight. And it's... Also, what's really good about funerals is the food is there. So, you go to a wake and there's food immediately. You don't have to piss about speaking to aunts and uncles you don't care about. So, there's that sort of thing. But the actual... If you look at what they're doing, you're selling a lady. Hooray! Let's sell a lady, everybody. Let's dress her up and pretend she's never had sex and walk her down the aisle and her father can sell her to there. And, look, there's another bloke there who'll do if the groom doesn't turn up. No. It's weird. It's proper weird. It really is weird when I think about the fact that some of my family are here and the last time I ever saw them was a wedding in 1987. There we go. Very strange indeed. It's just... I just... I mean, the equivalent is... Imagine going to an employer and part of your job interview was they looked in your mouth. That's the equivalent. It's just... It's icky. But you look lovely on a wedding day and I'd love the photos and you're so sweet. But no. It's... Yeah. I don't like the way it sets up one kind of relationship is so much more important than all others. And I think that's my issue. And that's my issue with break-up as well because we don't really have that language for friends or colleagues. And I feel like a lot of the problems with romantic love is because culturally we put so much pressure on it to be so many things for us, which is really quite a new thing historically. Of course, yes. To be like they've got to be our best friend and our cheerleader and the carer when we're sick and have kids with them. And, you know, often like to the exclusion, I think you were saying last week, how that, you know, often that friendships, you know, die down and like, you know, it's all about that partnership. And I think that puts those relationships under huge amount of pressure. It's why a lot of people stay in damaging relationships because they think they can't get out of them. It's also why a lot of people kind of go from one person to another because it's never going to be good enough because there's so much pressure. But if like we were dismantling that hierarchy and seeing all the relationships in our lives as equally important and putting a lot more time and effort into all of them across the board, I think that we'd be in a better place. So that's why I'm not keen on the whole marriage thing and also have some problems around the whole break-up thing because it's like, why aren't we treating all relationships as equally special and equally worthy of celebrating and marking the ending? Yes. That's good to say. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Oh no, I mean. And that is why never ever go out with MJ at Valentine's Day. You'll be disappointed. Oh, I'm romantic. Oh, are you? Oh, I am, yes. That did not sound romantic. That sounded very. With friends also. You can get my romantic anti-romance rant and then I will give you a flower. But what you're, what you're, what you're talking about is, kind of falls under the banner of relationship anarchy, which is kind of, well, kind of term for sort of really doing away with those hierarchies and celebrating and valuing friendships and other types of relationships. In one of my radio pieces, I called it a new currency of commitment, but it's about kind of redistributing that value that we place on relationships, isn't it? But what was fun was actually the one relationship anarchy meeting I went to when you were there, actually, and we had a chat. Yes. I just thought what was brilliant was it was a relationship anarchy meeting and I thought we're going to be just tearing up the patriarchy and it was the most organised meeting I've ever been to. We like queued, you know, until the room was ready and then we had an agenda. Yes. And it was like really kind of quite strict and regimented. It doesn't have to be this way. No, I know. But I just thought it was perhaps a slight irony. It wasn't very anarchist, was it? No, not really. But yeah, this idea of that. But I love that kind of principle. Yeah, I mean, relationship anarchy, you know, it's about valuing different relationships. Evenly and also the sense of the people being free. So it's kind of getting away from that kind of belonging idea. And yeah, like intentional relationships is another way of putting it if you don't want the anarchy word in there. But yeah, Justin and I talk about it quite a lot on our podcast. Just to give that a plug. Oh, yes. Meg, John and Justin. Meg, John and Justin.com. You can get a little worksheet so you can figure out how to do your relationships online if you want to. That's a bit too organised as well, isn't it? That sounds like. Yeah. Well, you have to. Or you can just listen to the podcast while you're working out. Some people say it's funny. If you're polyamorous, you have to be organised, don't you? If you are having multiple. But I don't like this idea either. This is why, you know, I mean, yeah, like, yeah. I mean, no, you don't. Because like, it's about, it's about having friendships. Exactly. You don't have to. A lot of polyamorous people do like have, you know, ridiculous spreadsheets and like calendars, colour coded. And I have been there. I have done that. But like, you don't have to. And again, I like this idea that if we just treat all our relationships as equally important and we're maybe not saying partnerships is a special thing where we have to do like dates every da-da-da and have the calendar. It would be good. I mean, I'm not talking, I still sort of, it would be nice to be able to have sex with one person, to have finances with another person, to have dinner with another person. Yeah. I mean, it's friendships, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, that's what I find. I find a lot of the kind of like relationships I have are with my friends more than anyone. Oh, definitely. And you can see what works with them, right? Yeah, exactly. And do those things. I talk about, I talk about love affairs. And it's really placing this value on that particular central person. Yeah. I feel like I have like with my friends, I have everything with them that I would have in a relationship except for sex. But like with all of my close friends, I mean, I have a good group of them and I have so much love and affinity for them. Well, I think you could be polyamorous and just be having sex with one person or having sex with no people. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Solo poly is another thing where people value their relationship with themselves. You know, that's, that's their primary relationship. And some people are asexual as well and might have multiple loving relationships. Yeah, which, you know, and that's again where non-monogamy opens up the option for like to have, not have sexual relationships, but they might be platonic, they might be romantic or platonic relationships. You know, I think this diversity of language that we get now around, you know, the different versions of asexuality and aromantic and different versions of polyamory and, you know, it just opens this whole territory up for people to find out what works for them instead of feeling like shoved into this mold that you're talking about. Yeah. This old. Patriarchal mold. But even though, I mean, we sort of say that, right, I'm just going to give a slight defense. My co-presenter on Making History is called Tom Holland. He's got this amazing book called Dominion, which is basically explaining how Christian we still are, even though we don't believe in God. And what's really interesting when you look at it is we sort of have this idea that, you know, oh, the problem is marriage and the problem is monogamy is enforced and everything else. But previously before that, it wasn't as though in Greek culture and Roman culture, everybody got to have sex with who you wanted. No, rich, powerful men got to have sex with whoever they wanted. Yes. And the rest of us got fucked. And then only if they were, well, it's literally because only if they were active. So if those guys were actually into being recipients, then that would have been found upon. Homosexual relationships were fine as long as you weren't the bottom. Yeah. Literally. Being seen as womanly was bad and being seen as weak was bad. And it wasn't until you had Christianity you actually went, oh, actually, our God is a very, very good God. Weak creature who died, you know, in the way a slave would die. And therefore actually being weak is a good thing. And maybe everybody has virtue and rights and everything like that. And that's where the whole sort of idea comes from. And monogamy is actually a way of protecting weak people. It's for women, really. It sounds really backwards and wrong because it's really patriarchal. But compared to the previous stuff, it's quite good. But it's not good. We can do better. We can do better. We need to move into the future. Yeah, we are. And we are moving into the future, aren't we? And I mean, some of these new terms, I don't really like things like ghosting because a lot of them seem to be kind of defining rather dicky behavior. And actually, we kind of make it sound kind of fun. But I don't know. What do you think about? I mean, I know it's pretentious, but some of the kind of terms that celebrities have used and endorsed like conscious uncoupling. I mean, it sounds icky, but I like the idea. No, definitely. I think it would be great. Again, if we can go away from putting all this pressure on this particular kind of relationship, that's potentially why we have to have all this language around breakup because we're expecting so much from people. And, you know, again, well, I think what you're saying about the dicky behavior as well, it's this weird area, love, where we like we can experience the best of what we're capable of. You know, we can really meet another person and be met ourselves in all of who we are and be kind of present with somebody. So easily drawn into like objectifying someone, making them into something for us, putting them on a pedestal, treating them in unrealistic ways, expecting too much of them in ways that make it impossible to stay. You know, either we stay and go through a lot of turmoil or we end up breaking up. Whereas if we could like have just multiple models for how to do these things and not put so much pressure on. So I guess that's where that kind of conscious and intentional relationship is a cool idea. This is going to make soap operas really boring. Yeah. It's like non-monogamy does, doesn't it? There's no drama here. This is the trouble. There's no smashing of plates. And I can't believe you slept with her. No, you told me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't that be awesome though? We might have energy for other things like, you know, saving the planet. It would be really great. No. Come on now. She's going too far. Sharon, you told me a funny story about ghosting because you did ghost a more casual lover. Oh, God, I forgot I told you that. Because of an unfortunate coincidence about their name. Yeah. So there was this guy and his girlfriend that I was seeing for a bit. And he was so annoying though. I should have dumped him a long time ago. But anyway, he... Oh, so my brother then had a child and named him Omar. And the guy that I was seeing, his name was Omar. So he then called me to be like, oh, do you want to come around? And I was just like, oh, I can't. I'm like, I'm ill. I can't. I'm sorry. And he was like, okay, cool. Like, I'll call you next week. And I was like, okay, bye. And the whole time I was just like, I can't fuck someone with the same name as my nephew. I can't do this. I don't know what to do. And I can't say it out loud because it makes me feel weird. So I was just like, just don't answer the phone. So a week later he called. And he still calls me every now and then. I just don't answer. I've locked his number now. Okay. Because it's just, it's too much now. But like, yeah, I just can't, I can't fuck someone with the same name as my nephew. I've had sex with somebody the same name as my mother. Oh, no, no, no, no. See, I don't have a problem. I don't meet that many. I'm in Orinda's, so I think I'm okay. Oh, dear. You were telling me as well about some kind of quite tricky experiences on the kind of dating apps and stuff as a bi woman. And maybe a bit of biphobia kind of from both sides, perhaps? Yeah, yeah. So I haven't actually been in a relationship with a woman. I've just fucked loads of women. So I kind of, I went on dating apps for a while. My friends downloaded dating apps for me, basically. And I was just like, oh, I guess I'll give it a go. And I hated it instantly. As soon as someone matched with me and messaged me, even if it was like, hey, how are you doing? I'd just be like, I fucking hate you. I just couldn't stand him. I don't know why. There was no reason. And so like, I took interest in you. That's probably the reason. Yeah, and I was just like, how dare you? Yeah. So I just, Lost your respect. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Tell me more about that. Yeah, we need to unpack that. This is for my therapist. Yeah, and what essentially happens to me on dating apps is if I match with a lesbian, they, when they find out I'm bisexual, they think I'm either going through a phase or I'll end up with a guy. And so they unmatch me or they just tell me they're not interested. And then when I match with a guy, they just want me for threesomes or they just want to hear the stories or whatever. So I, as a bisexual woman on dating apps, it's just, I've deleted them all, basically. It's just chaos. It's absolute chaos. So I'm just hoping to just be single forever. MJ, you're shaking your head. Just biphobia.
