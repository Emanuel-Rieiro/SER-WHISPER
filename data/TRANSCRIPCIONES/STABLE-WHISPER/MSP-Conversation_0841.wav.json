{"text": " This is arguably the highest risk, highest reward venture capital market in the world. So you must, in my opinion, take a conservative approach to buying and selling these stocks. And it's not that hard to do. I mean, look at it. There's 1,450 mining and engineering companies listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange and the Toronto Big Board. And so the trick is to reduce those down to something you can evaluate and decide what you want to be an owner of. So I have methodologies first to reduce that to 5%. So that's less than 100 companies. And right now I own about 2% and around 30 companies. And that's pretty typical for me. So you've got to be able to do that. And I take that as a conservative approach. You're eliminating 98% of these companies. And then we apply the power of truth to trading methodology, which is a very conservative approach. Now, part of the evaluation process, I want to ask you, do you use the database called CDAR? I probably seldom use CDAR except for company filings. And that happens when their websites are not complete, where they don't have the notice of their annual general meeting or their financials or their management and discussion analysis, commonly called an MDNA. So I do not go to CDAR unless the website is incomplete. CDAR would be the acronym for System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval. And it's exactly equivalent to what is called EDGAR in the US. I should mention that a website that is probably more important to me is called SETI, S-E-D-I. And that's where you can look at insider holdings and trades. And that's very important. When it comes to projects, we often hear companies convey they have a flagship project. Can you define for us what is a flagship project? That's the one that's most perspective and where their dollars in the ground should be going. So I think it's fundamental that every company have a flagship project, or in case of larger companies, several flagship projects. All right. Now, does the duration it takes for the company to find this flagship project factor into your decision? Or are you more concerned that once they identify the flagship project in their ability to make it come to fruition? Well, I generally would not speculate in a company that did not already have a flagship project unless it was a so-called prospect generator. And I've soured on that model quite robustly during the downturn in metal space. I'm no longer enamored with the prospect generator model. Secondly, the time frame that it takes to advance a project is critical because a junior generally has a five to seven year lifetime before they restructure, go bankrupt, roll back, kick out management, start all over with a new project. So for that reason, I'm not usually very fond of big projects such as porphyry copper projects where there's only one exit strategy, i.e. sell to a major mining company. And that process to get it big enough generally takes 10 years. So most juniors, unless they have very savvy management, should not get into that space, in my opinion. Now, what are some red flags that usually catch your eye on a flagship project? Well, you can change a lot of things, but there's two things of any project that you cannot change. We can mitigate the engineering, we can do this and that, but you cannot change the geology and you cannot change the geography. So those are two of the first things I look at. I look at the metal, I look at the geology, I look at where it's located, I look at the grade. So those are very key criteria. Now, Mickey, I know you like to filter the truth from promotion, so I have a twofold question here. Do you accept the information presented on a company website? And what features must a company, you know, a flagship project have to attract your attention? Well, I think I would generally give a company, a new company, I'm looking at the benefit of the doubt, but my so-called BS meter is set pretty high. So I can recognize things that are wrong and dig for more information a lot of times from the website. Features that a flagship project needs to have? Well, it's got to be the right metal, something I'm interested in. That generally amounts to a metal or a commodity that is traded in U.S. dollars on a world market with futures and options. It would need the right geography. I am very adverse to geopolitical risk. I avoid probably at this stage about four out of five countries in the world because we've talked about this before, I think, about geopolitical risk. And I generally do not play in Africa, seldom in Asia. I do accept the American Americas, certainly North America, Canada, Mexico, U.S., select countries in Latin America, specific countries in Europe, Scandinavia, for example. So from that point of view, you want to have an advanced project with the right metal, high grade infrastructure, not remote. The right management, et cetera, is a variety of factors. All right. We'll get to grade here in just a minute for our listeners. Two-fold question here again. Do you prefer speaking to investor relations, the CEO, or the geologist? And can you share specific questions that you'd like to have answered? And why is it important for speculators to take in a proactive approach such as yours? Well, I seldom talk to IR except to set up a meeting. I need to talk to a technical person. And if that's the geologist or an engineer that is not the CEO, that's fine. If the CEO is a banker or ex-broker or an accountant, I certainly want to involve the highest level of technical expertise in the company. A lot of times, the CEO is a geologist or an engineer. Questions? Geez, I have so many questions that I ask people. I would encourage people, listeners, to go to my website and look at the subscription base. It's free. And if you're free as a subscriber, I can give you access to my company evaluation template. And with that being said, Mickey, please share that website for us. Mercenarygeologist.com. So you go there on the left side. Click on a banner right underneath my mugshot. And you give us a name and an email address. You can fake your name. I don't care. But you have to give me a correct email address. And then you have access to all our content and my stock picks. And if you send me an email after you've done that, with evidence that you are a subscriber, i.e. a notice you receive from us, I'll send you the company evaluation template. On behalf of all of our listeners, thank you. Now, this question here may be slightly geared toward the financial side. But let me ask you this as well. How important is the net present value known as NPV? Well, on an advanced project that has gone to pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, it's paramount. I generally would not look at a project or a company that does not have an NPV much greater than the CapEx. I'm usually looking for one and a half or two times the CapEx for me to have continued interest in the project. And what about the internal rate of return, also known as IRR? Well, that's also paramount. And that's the same sort of criteria. It comes hand in hand with the net present value in any rigorous financial analysis. So, I'm looking for projects that have a 20% or greater IRR, internal rate of return, after tax with a reasonable discount. You know, a 5% discount is not reasonable. You can't build a project anywhere in the world at 5% discounted dollars. No one will loan you money for a project that must less than 10%, 10% to 12%. So, these companies that run 5% discounts are just trying to make sub-economic projects look better than they actually are.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.12, "text": " This is arguably the

So you must, in my opinion, take a conservative approach to buying and selling these stocks. And it's not that hard to do. I mean, look at it. There's 1,450 mining and engineering companies listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange and the Toronto Big Board. And so the trick is to reduce those down to something you can evaluate and decide what you want to be an owner of. So I have methodologies first to reduce that to 5%. So that's less than 100 companies. And right now I own about 2% and around 30 companies. And that's pretty typical for me. So you've got to be able to do that. And I take that as a conservative approach. You're eliminating 98% of these companies. And then we apply the power of truth to trading methodology, which is a very conservative approach. Now, part of the evaluation process, I want to ask you, do you use the database called CDAR? I probably seldom use CDAR except for company filings. And that happens when their websites are not complete, where they don't have the notice of their annual general meeting or their financials or their management and discussion analysis, commonly called an MDNA. So I do not go to CDAR unless the website is incomplete. CDAR would be the acronym for System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval. And it's exactly equivalent to what is called EDGAR in the US. I should mention that a website that is probably more important to me is called SETI, S-E-D-I. And that's where you can look at insider holdings and trades. And that's very important. When it comes to projects, we often hear companies convey they have a flagship project. Can you define for us what is a flagship project? That's the one that's most perspective and where their dollars in the ground should be going. So I think it's fundamental that every company have a flagship project, or in case of larger companies, several flagship projects. All right. Now, does the duration it takes for the company to find this flagship project factor into your decision? Or are you more concerned that once they identify the flagship project in their ability to make it come to fruition? Well, I generally would not speculate in a company that did not already have a flagship project unless it was a so-called prospect generator. And I've soured on that model quite robustly during the downturn in metal space. I'm no longer enamored with the prospect generator model. Secondly, the time frame that it takes to advance a project is critical because a junior generally has a five to seven year lifetime before they restructure, go bankrupt, roll back, kick out management, start all over with a new project. So for that reason, I'm not usually very fond of big projects such as porphyry copper projects where there's only one exit strategy, i.e. sell to a major mining company. And that process to get it big enough generally takes 10 years. So most juniors, unless they have very savvy management, should not get into that space, in my opinion. Now, what are some red flags that usually catch your eye on a flagship project? Well, you can change a lot of things, but there's two things of any project that you cannot change. We can mitigate the engineering, we can do this and that, but you cannot change the geology and you cannot change the geography. So those are two of the first things I look at. I look at the metal, I look at the geology, I look at where it's located, I look at the grade. So those are very key criteria. Now, Mickey, I know you like to filter the truth from promotion, so I have a twofold question here. Do you accept the information presented on a company website? And what features must a company, you know, a flagship project have to attract your attention? Well, I think I would generally give a company, a new company, I'm looking at the benefit of the doubt, but my so-called BS meter is set pretty high. So I can recognize things that are wrong and dig for more information a lot of times from the website. Features that a flagship project needs to have? Well, it's got to be the right metal, something I'm interested in. That generally amounts to a metal or a commodity that is traded in U.S. dollars on a world market with futures and options. It would need the right geography. I am very adverse to geopolitical risk. I avoid probably at this stage about four out of five countries in the world because we've talked about this before, I think, about geopolitical risk. And I generally do not play in Africa, seldom in Asia. I do accept the American Americas, certainly North America, Canada, Mexico, U.S., select countries in Latin America, specific countries in Europe, Scandinavia, for example. So from that point of view, you want to have an advanced project with the right metal, high grade infrastructure, not remote. The right management, et cetera, is a variety of factors. All right. We'll get to grade here in just a minute for our listeners. Two-fold question here again. Do you prefer speaking to investor relations, the CEO, or the geologist? And can you share specific questions that you'd like to have answered? And why is it important for speculators to take in a proactive approach such as yours? Well, I seldom talk to IR except to set up a meeting. I need to talk to a technical person. And if that's the geologist or an engineer that is not the CEO, that's fine. If the CEO is a banker or ex-broker or an accountant, I certainly want to involve the highest level of technical expertise in the company. A lot of times, the CEO is a geologist or an engineer. Questions? Geez, I have so many questions that I ask people. I would encourage people, listeners, to go to my website and look at the subscription base. It's free. And if you're free as a subscriber, I can give you access to my company evaluation template. And with that being said, Mickey, please share that website for us. Mercenarygeologist.com. So you go there on the left side. Click on a banner right underneath my mugshot. And you give us a name and an email address. You can fake your name. I don't care. But you have to give me a correct email address. And then you have access to all our content and my stock picks. And if you send me an email after you've done that, with evidence that you are a subscriber, i.e. a notice you receive from us, I'll send you the company evaluation template. On behalf of all of our listeners, thank you. Now, this question here may be slightly geared toward the financial side. But let me ask you this as well. How important is the net present value known as NPV? Well, on an advanced project that has gone to pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, it's paramount. I generally would not look at a project or a company that does not have an NPV much greater than the CapEx. I'm usually looking for one and a half or two times the CapEx for me to have continued interest in the project. And what about the internal rate of return, also known as IRR? Well, that's also paramount. And that's the same sort of criteria. It comes hand in hand with the net present value in any rigorous financial analysis. So, I'm looking for projects that have a 20% or greater IRR, internal rate of return, after tax with a reasonable discount. You know, a 5% discount is not reasonable. You can't build a project anywhere in the world at 5% discounted dollars. No one will loan you money for a project that must less than 10%, 10% to 12%. So, these companies that run 5% discounts are just trying to make sub-economic projects look better than they actually are.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.9, "text": " This is
