Visit AmericaJoy.com What's up guys and welcome to an all new episode of The Fro Show being brought to you proudly on the 4Eyed Radio. As always, I'm your host Matthew Renfro and this is my weekly independent music podcast for your ear canals. So this episode is going to be a little different. I've got a guest, so that's the first thing, which is pretty rad. Hello. Yeah, this is Christopher Murray. He was on the Socially Awkward Studio show if you listened to it last week. I was on the show and we talked about The Fro Show and now I'm here. Hey-o. And it worked out. And then second was I was going to bring up that we were recording it somewhere else. We actually went to a local place called Gangplank. Yeah. And I guess I'm still trying to fully understand exactly what this place is. It's hard to explain. It's a pretty cool place. It's a community place. I know that much, but... I want to hear your rendition of this. Okay. So my rendition of it is I walk through the front doors and I just see this open room full of computer monitors and just desk space. And I immediately thought... Did you see the 3D printer? In the back? Yeah. I saw the laser cutter. There's a laser cutter, but before you get to that hallway, there's a 3D printer. It's like the new MakerBot, MakerBot 2, I think they call it. Yeah. Anyway, it's pretty cool. Pretty cool. If you haven't seen one of those. That is pretty cool. Anyways, this place is... I guess this was like the office area of it, like the workspaces for the companies that actually work out of the place. Yeah. So Megan was with me, so we just walk in and I'm like, okay. And then I see this little sign. That's how it is when you first get in. It's kind of like, do I have long hair? I see the sign that says like vending. So I was like, okay, let's just go back there because that seems like a public place. I felt like I was intruding on like an office or something. So we walked back there and then I saw you in the podcast room that they have there. And that place was cool because there's just a bunch of like random empty rooms that I guess the public can come in and utilize. Yeah, they're used as like classrooms or practice rooms or there's a study room, all kinds of things. Like there's an area where like the gangplank, the headquarters of the area, everybody goes in there and does what they do, whoever runs the place. Yeah. But the place is really cool. It's really community based. So there's nobody that really runs it. You go in and it's, there's key masters, which is what brings us to here at Redfro's house today. We're supposed to meet today actually at gangplank because we're going to try out the equipment. Yeah. And the key master didn't show up today. They're supposed to be here at 11, but. Whenever I hear key master, it makes me think of Ghostbusters. Yeah. That's just what I call it. Are you the gatekeeper? Key master. Yeah. So this place, they have a podcast room and they've got a pretty decent Mackie soundboard there. And we were sitting down trying to kind of figure it out yesterday. Yeah. And finally got it to where we were like, okay, we can actually do this. We, we, it's now playing back the audio that we're recording and everything. Right. So we're all ready, revved up and ready to go. But now we're back here at the Casa de Redfro with my, my little single solo thing. Mike set up in the room. So that's why it sounds really hollow and kind of not standard, but we're making do with what we have. So anyway, gangplank is a cool place. If you ever want to check it out, downtown Chandler, it's open for entrepreneurs. It's a public place funded by the city of Chandler. So you're free to go in no matter how. And actually we, uh, today we actually met a few people. Um, this dude named Russell Brown. And he's with, um, equation GAD, which is, uh, it stands for give a day. And, um, he was kind of telling us about his, his, I don't know if it was a nonprofit or, yeah. Um, basically it's, he, he helps, uh, little kids in, uh, I guess, uh, starving third world countries or something like that to kind of educate them on like business practices and stuff like that. I think that's the gist of what I got. Kids. I didn't get, I thought he, I thought he was saying like children. Yeah. Is that what he meant? I wasn't sure what he meant. I thought he was just talking about like the general community, like trying to teach people about business, um, some kind of business education. I wasn't sure what he meant, but anyway. And he also said something about, um, like fashion, like, uh, cause they were taking photos while we were there and they were doing a, uh, like a fashion shoot, but it was for one of their, um, campaigns. I don't know what they're doing there, but this, this group of people, this girl was dressed up, uh, and, um, looked like a fashion shoot. They had cameras and whatever that device was. The, uh, the, the make the rig thing that they built. Anyways, they were, they were cool individuals and, uh, we got their contact information. So just go to their website. We probably figured it out, but anyway, gat equation.com is their website. It's a local Chandler thing. So, so see if we can get Russell on the socially awkward studio show. So we can come on and talk about what he does and all that stuff. We can figure out if it's a thing for children or not, but this is a music show. Yeah. So we can, we can get back to music. So, um, basically thought we could just kind of sit down and, and just talk music and what we like and, and all that good stuff. And I know that you have played in at least one band. Yeah. Um, have you played in any other bands? I played in another band. Yeah. I played in, uh, the Alcohox when they were together, the Alcohox. Yeah. We were doing, I was mostly in, they did a lot of covers. So I did some covers like, um, Stevie wonder, superstitious stuff like that. Just the stuff they need horns on. Yeah. Like, like it was only like two or three songs. I think I did every once in a while when they were playing. And then I would sit in a crowd and watch the rest of it. Yeah. Not everything without horns. It was fun. It was, it was a lot of fun. So I know that the, uh, the lefties. Yeah. That was, uh, that was the one that I remember you being in. Right. I do remember. I have a horrible memory. And if you listen to socially awkward, uh, I met you a couple of times and, uh, the, the most recent time I was like, Hey, what's up? I'm Matt. And you're like, yeah, dude, I, I know. I'm like, I've met you like a dozen times. I was like, Oh, remember I played in the lefties. I was like, Oh man, I feel like such a jerk. But that was, that's just, you know, that's me. I'm, I'm horrible at remembering people. So we used to play more famous than me. So we used to play shows together when I was in half. Oh, we played a couple of shows together. I know that much. Yeah. We put a neckbeards, neckbeards, the soda bar, the soda bar, actually not neckbeards. Wasn't too bad. It wasn't bad. It was fun for, for a, uh, in all ages. Yeah, exactly. It was, it was pretty cool. Yeah. Um, but the lefties, you guys had a pretty good time. Pretty good run. Uh, yeah, I, we did have a good run. We had a really good run. Um, and then it just called it out. Everyone got, everyone kind of went their own way after a while and got kind of, we got eager to get onto other things and starting college and all that in 2005. We did like a college battle, the bands, and then played for like a new year's thing. And that was our freshman year of college. And then that was our last show. Well, didn't you guys play with a, was it Roger Clemens? Uh, we didn't play with Roger Klein. We, um, collective soul. We got, that's what it was. We got to open for collective soul at the Tempe music festival every year, which is a huge festival. Like, um, the most recent one I went to had like Weezer and sublime with Rome and stuff like that. So they get big guests. And, um, before us they had blues traveler. Uh, so yeah, my old trumpet player, Kevin, he used to always say that blues traveler. Open for us. Yeah. And then we got to play and then in between them and collective soul. So that was a pretty, that was a sweet experience. Yeah. I was going to like, um, there was a lot of people there. Yeah. Like 7,000 in the crowd. So to be up there, like I could only imagine it, like how the rush was and like the nervousness and all that stuff. Cause I would totally be nervous for that. But to have that experience, I think that's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. And then you just, I mean, man, the good thing is like, you just get to rely on all the, all the preparation of playing all the other shows you've done and all that. You can just, just play your music, just get through it and you'll be fine. So we did a good job. Uh, we had a lot of fun. Kevin got everyone to yell slayer. I think I'll probably never get a chance to do this again. Yeah. So, uh, I just want everybody else slayer on the count of three. It's like one, two, three. And everyone yelled. They're like, it was awesome. Oh, that's funny. Did it, did anybody get that on video already to do like that? Yeah. There's a video of it somewhere. Yeah. Actually, Mark Treadwell probably has it. Cool. His dad. Yeah. Mark played bass for you guys, right? Uh, no, not, uh, Ryan played it. Mark is their dad. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Ryan. I'm thinking Ryan. Yeah. All those tread walls. Again, I'm horrible with names. No worries. There's a lot of tread walls. Um, yeah, he played bass for you guys. Uh, Ryan played bass for us and he did a lot of our sound stuff. Nice. Um, yeah. And, uh, that was a lot of fun. And he got us all high. Um, that's good stuff, man. I remember like playing a few shows with the guys and then, um, when you guys were announced that you guys were going to play the festival, um, not gonna lie. Part of me was like, like, what? Like, yeah. Who, who the hell are these people? Cause like you guys, you guys had a good run, but it was kind of, it was kind of a short run. Yeah. I mean, it was a couple of years before we ended up there. I mean, yeah, like we were doing, we started in, um, uh, well, I only started when I was, I was like 15. I was a sophomore in high school when I joined that band. And they had already been around for at least a couple of months that I knew. And so between my sophomore year and then senior year, it was like the summer of my senior year. So like we were, we'd been a band for at least like three years before we did that show. Oh, crazy. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. It was space was somewhere else. No, but like the thing is we, we didn't get shows incredibly often. It was probably like, sometimes we would have a run where like we had one like every week for like one month, but a lot of times it would be like two months between every show or something. So like, it was pretty sparse. It was hard to get a ska band of seven people together to even practice like even once a month sometimes. Yeah. That like getting a show together was sometimes tough, but, um, so maybe you just didn't see us out there as often. Maybe. Yeah. It's gotta be it. Do you guys do any recordings? Yeah. We did some good recordings. We did some good recordings over at the conservatory. Oh yeah. Yeah. I have them somewhere. Um, I guess, I don't know. Maybe I should bring them sometime. Yeah, man, you should post them out. I can play, I can play a lefties track on the show. Yeah. Throwback, a throwback. Yeah. They're fun. It was a fun time. The conservatory is cool. I've recorded there a couple of times actually. Oh yeah. Um, just with, you know, people that are going there to get their education, like they're required to like record somebody. So. So it's a look for a band. Yeah. That's exactly what we got that deal. And it's cool. I mean, it's free recording and it's, that's pretty rad. Yeah. Um, but speaking of neckbeards, do you guys ever play at like, um, the real bar? We didn't play the real bar. One time we played at the sale in the sale in, okay. Before we were all 21. So after this show, they kicked us all out. Oh, nice. Sale in. That's like a huge kind of venue right now for the scene. Yeah. I like what kind of scene? Just like the, the music scene. Yeah. The music scene. Yeah. They have an outdoor one and an indoor. Yeah. And that they used to do a lot of bluegrass stuff and like the outdoor area. And like, um, I gotta go there more often. Cause I, they always have good selection of music over at sale in. Yeah. Well, the music scene here in Arizona or Phoenix, that is, um, has really shifted a lot over the years. Um, back like when I remember I came in and when like Mason and stuff was shutting down. Yeah. Yeah. And that's like when I got into the band that I was in and yeah. Mason just shut down the Nile closed. Yeah. Which is now it's reopened. Um, there was the real bar. It was originally the princess and the PI. Then they changed it to the real bar. Um, and the edge used to do their shows all the time. There was neckbeards then, um, bash on ash. I don't remember. Oh yeah. I've heard of it, but I never went. Yeah. There was a, there was quite a bit of different venues. What's the one that RX is? It was, that was a call. They closed down. Didn't I? What's it called? The art RX always played. It's right next to this freaking karaoke place. Right next to this place called the horse and hound. It's called clubhouse. Oh, the clubhouse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They closed it.

Visit AmericaJoy.com What's up guys and welcome to an all new episode of The Fro Show being brought to you proudly on the 4Eyed Radio. As always, I'm your host Matthew Renfro and this is my weekly independent music podcast for your ear canals. So this episode is going to be a little different. I've got a guest, so that's the first thing, which is pretty rad. Hello. Yeah, this is Christopher Murray. He was on the Socially Awkward Studio show if you listened to it last week. I was on the show and we talked about The Fro Show and now I'm here. Hey-o. And it worked out. And then second was I was going to bring up that we were recording it somewhere else. We actually went to a local place called Gangplank. Yeah. And I guess I'm still trying to fully understand exactly what this place is. It's hard to explain. It's a pretty cool place. It's a community place. I know that much, but... I want to hear your rendition of this. Okay. So my rendition of it is I walk through the front doors and I just see this open room full of computer monitors and just desk space. And I immediately thought... Did you see the 3D printer? In the back? Yeah. I saw the laser cutter. There's a laser cutter, but before you get to that hallway, there's a 3D printer. It's like the new MakerBot, MakerBot 2, I think they call it. Yeah. Anyway, it's pretty cool. Pretty cool. If you haven't seen one of those. That is pretty cool. Anyways, this place is... I guess this was like the office area of it, like the workspaces for the companies that actually work out of the place. Yeah. So Megan was with me, so we just walk in and I'm like, okay. And then I see this little sign. That's how it is when you first get in. It's kind of like, do I have long hair? I see the sign that says like vending. So I was like, okay, let's just go back there because that seems like a public place. I felt like I was intruding on like an office or something. So we walked back there and then I saw you in the podcast room that they have there. And that place was cool because there's just a bunch of like random empty rooms that I guess the public can come in and utilize. Yeah, they're used as like classrooms or practice rooms or there's a study room, all kinds of things. Like there's an area where like the gangplank, the headquarters of the area, everybody goes in there and does what they do, whoever runs the place. Yeah. But the place is really cool. It's really community based. So there's nobody that really runs it. You go in and it's, there's key masters, which is what brings us to here at Redfro's house today. We're supposed to meet today actually at gangplank because we're going to try out the equipment. Yeah. And the key master didn't show up today. They're supposed to be here at 11, but. Whenever I hear key master, it makes me think of Ghostbusters. Yeah. That's just what I call it. Are you the gatekeeper? Key master. Yeah. So this place, they have a podcast room and they've got a pretty decent Mackie soundboard there. And we were sitting down trying to kind of figure it out yesterday. Yeah. And finally got it to where we were like, okay, we can actually do this. We, we, it's now playing back the audio that we're recording and everything. Right. So we're all ready, revved up and ready to go. But now we're back here at the Casa de Redfro with my, my little single solo thing. Mike set up in the room. So that's why it sounds really hollow and kind of not standard, but we're making do with what we have. So anyway, gangplank is a cool place. If you ever want to check it out, downtown Chandler, it's open for entrepreneurs. It's a public place funded by the city of Chandler. So you're free to go in no matter how. And actually we, uh, today we actually met a few people. Um, this dude named Russell Brown. And he's with, um, equation GAD, which is, uh, it stands for give a day. And, um, he was kind of telling us about his, his, I don't know if it was a nonprofit or, yeah. Um, basically it's, he, he helps, uh, little kids in, uh, I guess, uh, starving third world countries or something like that to kind of educate them on like business practices and stuff like that. I think that's the gist of what I got. Kids. I didn't get, I thought he, I thought he was saying like children. Yeah. Is that what he meant? I wasn't sure what he meant. I thought he was just talking about like the general community, like trying to teach people about business, um, some kind of business education. I wasn't sure what he meant, but anyway. And he also said something about, um, like fashion, like, uh, cause they were taking photos while we were there and they were doing a, uh, like a fashion shoot, but it was for one of their, um, campaigns. I don't know what they're doing there, but this, this group of people, this girl was dressed up, uh, and, um, looked like a fashion shoot. They had cameras and whatever that device was. The, uh, the, the make the rig thing that they built. Anyways, they were, they were cool individuals and, uh, we got their contact information. So just go to their website. We probably figured it out, but anyway, gat equation.com is their website. It's a local Chandler thing. So, so see if we can get Russell on the socially awkward studio show. So we can come on and talk about what he does and all that stuff. We can figure out if it's a thing for children or not, but this is a music show. Yeah. So we can, we can get back to music. So, um, basically thought we could just kind of sit down and, and just talk music and what we like and, and all that good stuff. And I know that you have played in at least one band. Yeah. Um, have you played in any other bands? I played in another band. Yeah. I played in, uh, the Alcohox when they were together, the Alcohox. Yeah. We were doing, I was mostly in, they did a lot of covers. So I did some covers like, um, Stevie wonder, superstitious stuff like that. Just the stuff they need horns on. Yeah. Like, like it was only like two or three songs. I think I did every once in a while when they were playing. And then I would sit in a crowd and watch the rest of it. Yeah. Not everything without horns. It was fun. It was, it was a lot of fun. So I know that the, uh, the lefties. Yeah. That was, uh, that was the one that I remember you being in. Right. I do remember. I have a horrible memory. And if you listen to socially awkward, uh, I met you a couple of times and, uh, the, the most recent time I was like, Hey, what's up? I'm Matt. And you're like, yeah, dude, I, I know. I'm like, I've met you like a dozen times. I was like, Oh, remember I played in the lefties. I was like, Oh man, I feel like such a jerk. But that was, that's just, you know, that's me. I'm, I'm horrible at remembering people. So we used to play more famous than me. So we used to play shows together when I was in half. Oh, we played a couple of shows together. I know that much. Yeah. We put a neckbeards, neckbeards, the soda bar, the soda bar, actually not neckbeards. Wasn't too bad. It wasn't bad. It was fun for, for a, uh, in all ages. Yeah, exactly. It was, it was pretty cool. Yeah. Um, but the lefties, you guys had a pretty good time. Pretty good run. Uh, yeah, I, we did have a good run. We had a really good run. Um, and then it just called it out. Everyone got, everyone kind of went their own way after a while and got kind of, we got eager to get onto other things and starting college and all that in 2005. We did like a college battle, the bands, and then played for like a new year's thing. And that was our freshman year of college. And then that was our last show. Well, didn't you guys play with a, was it Roger Clemens? Uh, we didn't play with Roger Klein. We, um, collective soul. We got, that's what it was. We got to open for collective soul at the Tempe music festival every year, which is a huge festival. Like, um, the most recent one I went to had like Weezer and sublime with Rome and stuff like that. So they get big guests. And, um, before us they had blues traveler. Uh, so yeah, my old trumpet player, Kevin, he used to always say that blues traveler. Open for us. Yeah. And then we got to play and then in between them and collective soul. So that was a pretty, that was a sweet experience. Yeah. I was going to like, um, there was a lot of people there. Yeah. Like 7,000 in the crowd. So to be up there, like I could only imagine it, like how the rush was and like the nervousness and all that stuff. Cause I would totally be nervous for that. But to have that experience, I think that's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. And then you just, I mean, man, the good thing is like, you just get to rely on all the, all the preparation of playing all the other shows you've done and all that. You can just, just play your music, just get through it and you'll be fine. So we did a good job. Uh, we had a lot of fun. Kevin got everyone to yell slayer. I think I'll probably never get a chance to do this again. Yeah. So, uh, I just want everybody else slayer on the count of three. It's like one, two, three. And everyone yelled. They're like, it was awesome. Oh, that's funny. Did it, did anybody get that on video already to do like that? Yeah. There's a video of it somewhere. Yeah. Actually, Mark Treadwell probably has it. Cool. His dad. Yeah. Mark played bass for you guys, right? Uh, no, not, uh, Ryan played it. Mark is their dad. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Ryan. I'm thinking Ryan. Yeah. All those tread walls. Again, I'm horrible with names. No worries. There's a lot of tread walls. Um, yeah, he played bass for you guys. Uh, Ryan played bass for us and he did a lot of our sound stuff. Nice. Um, yeah. And, uh, that was a lot of fun. And he got us all high. Um, that's good stuff, man. I remember like playing a few shows with the guys and then, um, when you guys were announced that you guys were going to play the festival, um, not gonna lie. Part of me was like, like, what? Like, yeah. Who, who the hell are these people? Cause like you guys, you guys had a good run, but it was kind of, it was kind of a short run. Yeah. I mean, it was a couple of years before we ended up there. I mean, yeah, like we were doing, we started in, um, uh, well, I only started when I was, I was like 15. I was a sophomore in high school when I joined that band. And they had already been around for at least a couple of months that I knew. And so between my sophomore year and then senior year, it was like the summer of my senior year. So like we were, we'd been a band for at least like three years before we did that show. Oh, crazy. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. It was space was somewhere else. No, but like the thing is we, we didn't get shows incredibly often. It was probably like, sometimes we would have a run where like we had one like every week for like one month, but a lot of times it would be like two months between every show or something. So like, it was pretty sparse. It was hard to get a ska band of seven people together to even practice like even once a month sometimes. Yeah. That like getting a show together was sometimes tough, but, um, so maybe you just didn't see us out there as often. Maybe. Yeah. It's gotta be it. Do you guys do any recordings? Yeah. We did some good recordings. We did some good recordings over at the conservatory. Oh yeah. Yeah. I have them somewhere. Um, I guess, I don't know. Maybe I should bring them sometime. Yeah, man, you should post them out. I can play, I can play a lefties track on the show. Yeah. Throwback, a throwback. Yeah. They're fun. It was a fun time. The conservatory is cool. I've recorded there a couple of times actually. Oh yeah. Um, just with, you know, people that are going there to get their education, like they're required to like record somebody. So. So it's a look for a band. Yeah. That's exactly what we got that deal. And it's cool. I mean, it's free recording and it's, that's pretty rad. Yeah. Um, but speaking of neckbeards, do you guys ever play at like, um, the real bar? We didn't play the real bar. One time we played at the sale in the sale in, okay. Before we were all 21. So after this show, they kicked us all out. Oh, nice. Sale in. That's like a huge kind of venue right now for the scene. Yeah. I like what kind of scene? Just like the, the music scene. Yeah. The music scene. Yeah. They have an outdoor one and an indoor. Yeah. And that they used to do a lot of bluegrass stuff and like the outdoor area. And like, um, I gotta go there more often. Cause I, they always have good selection of music over at sale in. Yeah. Well, the music scene here in Arizona or Phoenix, that is, um, has really shifted a lot over the years. Um, back like when I remember I came in and when like Mason and stuff was shutting down. Yeah. Yeah. And that's like when I got into the band that I was in and yeah. Mason just shut down the Nile closed. Yeah. Which is now it's reopened. Um, there was the real bar. It was originally the princess and the PI. Then they changed it to the real bar. Um, and the edge used to do their shows all the time. There was neckbeards then, um, bash on ash. I don't remember. Oh yeah. I've heard of it, but I never went. Yeah. There was a, there was quite a bit of different venues. What's the one that RX is? It was, that was a call. They closed down. Didn't I? What's it called? The art RX always played. It's right next to this freaking karaoke place. Right next to this place called the horse and hound. It's called clubhouse. Oh, the clubhouse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They closed it.
