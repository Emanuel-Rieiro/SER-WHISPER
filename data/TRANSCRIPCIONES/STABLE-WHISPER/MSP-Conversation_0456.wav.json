{"text": " Welcome to the show, Julia. Thanks for having me. So, all right, tell us what exactly is Brave the World? You summed it up pretty well. It's just anything that I find worthwhile exploring and delving into and sometimes standing up in the name of or against. So, I don't know, in the past I've attended CPAC and have asked very anarchistic questions. That was fun. That was one of my first projects. I did the protests at Bilderberg. I've been following the Silk Road case and doing some, I guess, reporting, but more, it's, I don't like to use the word reporting because I think journalists are blood-sucking scum. It's more of a moral support and ethical support in the name of free speech. So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, but I think that's good enough. So, Julia, where does the name Brave the World come from? Does it have an origin that means something to you? Yeah, so everyone knows Brave New World, right? So, instead of a brave new world, instead of embracing a brave new world, we should brave the world and go in the opposite direction. Very cool. And I actually had a question about what you were speaking on a few moments ago, and it had to do with your protesting Bilderberg and also your hatred of journalists because I think that there are awesome journalists and poor journalists like anything else. So, why is it that it took journalists so long to even figure out that Bilderberg is a thing? Because, well, this is the kind of stages of the status quo that we get fed. So, what you have first is complete denial, right? They deny that something's happened completely. Once that becomes harder to do, they label you as conspiracy theorists and say, oh, it's an over-Germanization. Once that becomes apparent that it's not true again, they accept the reality, and they accept that we know the reality, but they normalize it. So, Bilderberg, oh, it's no big deal. It's just a meeting of powerful people and families and politicians and those companies that are in charge of manufacturing arms meeting with potential presidents. No big deal. Oh, and nobody ever really knows when and where and the list is secret and they block off entire public streets and roads, but it's no big deal. Oh, and your taxes pay for it. No big deal. And your taxes also pay for their security. I believe the Copenhagen one cost over 100,000 euros just for security. And when I was there, I actually vined an endless stream of high-protection armored vehicles coming in and out of Bilderberg, the hotel that they were doing it at. You still with us, Julia? Uh-huh. Okay, cool. It sounded like you trailed off there for a second. Yeah, I don't remember the question now. I went on a tangent. I may have answered it. Bilderberg tends to get anyone going on a tangent, myself included, so it's a fascinating thing. Right, journalists. Yes. Right, so, again, and journalism has taken, like, I've been saying this for a little while now, journalism used to be a profession where it was okay to have a bias and an opinion. It was, in fact, encouraged. Now, to have a bias or an opinion is wrong. That's bad journalism. But the very fact that we deny that there's always a bias and then there's always an opinion when a journalist writes is more dishonest than having an outright bias. When you have something like a very obvious conflict and you give both sides of the story, even though one is obviously in the wrong, I think that's morally reprehensible and I think that it's dishonest because you're giving the same weight to something that might not deserve the same weight. So the entire concept of journalism has been bastardized to me and I hate when I'm called a journalist and even the journalists that I've worked with that are independent and in the libertarian and anarchist communities, I've learned to disrespect a lot of them as well because I've personally experienced some very dishonest activity. So that's really interesting. There's, behind, let's say, the Bilderbergs, right, there's, like, this core philosophy that it seems like you sort of centered a lot of your work around. Could you describe for our listeners sort of what is it about, you know, bad actors in journalism, bad actors at the Bilderberg system that you're really getting at here philosophically? Well, I understand having a kind of motivational factor of gain, right, so, but it's become so, it's become the sole purpose of people being a journalist. So you get even people that are supposed to be morally honest and doing good, like people in the libertarian movement, that that is the standard they claim to be on, you know, non-aggression, you know, they're not not-profit, but I keep seeing people solely focusing on clickbait and recently something happened where there was a private letter that Ross Ulbrich sent to a very popular libertarian radio show to an individual from that show saying, thanks for supporting me, blah, blah, blah, and he said a few private things in the letter which were meant to be private, and they went and published it as a headline saying, the first public letter from Ross Ulbrich, that is incredibly inappropriate, and the things that were in the letter actually had the potential of hurting him because of the position he's in. His lawyers were very worried, and his mother asked the people directly to take it down, and they wouldn't take it down until Ross spent his call quota and his own money, which he has almost none left, to call them and ask them to take it down. So I'm seeing this dishonesty in the name of profit, even in our own community, and Ross has written, they're not the first people to get a letter from Ross, I know many people that have gotten letters from Ross, and they did not go ahead and publish it. I did not publish my letters on my blog from Ross, because I assume that they're private. You know, and I think that the main word there is assume, when it comes to that, and it's really interesting when it comes to private communication, as what is private and what is public, and it really comes down to what you make private and what you make public, and I'm probably the oddest one of the whole decentralized group here, because I have not made a certain, I haven't taken a stance on the Ross situation, because I think obviously what he did is, you know, the freedom part of me says, oh, who cares, it's to each his own, but then the other part of me goes, well, when you play with fire and you get burned, and then you see that he got life in prison, and I as a taxpayer have to pay for that, that is what bothers me actually the most. So I'm actually, you know, very interested in that more than anything else is the sentence. Well, you should be upset with the state for having to pay those taxes, not with Ross, right? Absolutely, and that's, yeah, absolutely, and the judge. Mm-hmm, and I mean, the whole, I just, I've been, I've had two interviews before this too, and there's one thing I just keep reiterating. The whole thing of whether Ross is guilty or not, and there's been a lot of finger pointing at his supporters, saying that we've been inconsistent, oh, one minute he's not DPR, the next minute he's, is DPR, but go anti-drug war. We have not changed our tune. His supporters maintain that he's innocent, and let me explain what we mean by innocent. If Ross is DPR the whole time, started it throughout, the only person who was DPR, if he was DPR some of the time, and multiple DPRs are involved, he wasn't DPR at all. All of those make him still innocent, because at the end of the day, the Silk Road reduced harm, saved lives, and took violence off the streets. That is not even negotiable. So in an ethical sense, he is innocent. In the law sense, he's guilty, but, you know, so are people in, that follow the Muslim religion, and are under, Muslim law, that drink breast milk on the third full moon of the year, they're guilty to be punishable by death. So I mean, if you're guilty by law, anything can be made illegal, right? This whole trial situation and sentencing with Ross is the way it has me sick to my stomach, and it's been pretty upsetting for a lot of people, I'm sure. I understand you were at the trial. Were you also present at the sentencing, and can you tell us a little bit about your experience with either of those? Yeah, I was at the trial, and if anybody wants to just get up to date with how it went down, I have very thorough videos on my channel, and it's Brave the World channel on YouTube. You can just search it, it's easy. Or my website, bravetheworld.com. But yeah, the trial itself was daunting, they really dragged it out, the prosecution was very brutal, and they pandered to their audience, which was a jury of his peers, which was not, because they were all, most of them were government workers, and very basic people, not to be rude, but a jury of his peers would be at least university graduates, at least people that are somewhat technologically savvy, at least people that are under 40 years old. So it was not a jury of his peers. So the entire process was pretty horrific, and again, the behavior from journalists was incredibly inappropriate. I was misquoted, Lynn was misquoted, and then the same people who misquote us for their clicks come to our faces and say, oh, can I get another interview with you? So, I mean, that was not a fun time. I did get a flight to go see him during the sentencing, but then the sentencing changed after I already booked my flight, and I just didn't have the means. I had to change it back, and I decided to go home instead. So one of the things you talked about a little bit earlier was this idea that things can be against the law by the state or by a central authority, but still morally correct, right? Or morally, or the inverse, things can be morally wrong and still perfectly legal. One of the things I think you pursued, a lot of people pursued very early on in sort of the trial, was this idea of jury nullification, where if the jury feels that the law itself is unjust, they can, you know, not convict the person in the court. They can actually basically nullify that law for that sentence. Yeah. That's a constitutional right. But the judge, right before the jury went to deliberate, she actually said, even if you don't agree with the law, you still have to judge according to the law. So she was alluding to the fact that jury nullification exists. She knew that most of those people are uninformed, but she still took the precaution to dismiss any, you know, cloudiness in their mind in case they were leaning in that direction. So she was very adamant about being against the concept of jury nullification. The law is the law, and, you know, he did this, this, and this, therefore he broke this, this, and that law, therefore he's guilty. Morality or, you know, that did not count. Yeah, it was kind of tragic, and now it's kind of an inverse state where the state is the one committing the violence against a morally innocent individual, right? And that's sort of the travesty of it all. What is the role? Go ahead. In murderers? Like, does he, that is, that is a complete infringement on any kind of human rights, even by the most, like, by the most basic standards. Well, and what's interesting is in the community, you know, everybody feels that he largely helped to remove violence from the system. So what do you think is the role? What can we gain from this, and what can we do today, first and foremost? And then what can we do to make sure that things like this, this absurdity doesn't ever happen again? Jeffrey Tucker wrote a cool article, and he named Russell Brick the Socrates of today, and he named all of these historic characters that were prosecuted for being, you know, a trailblazer, and making, like, a water, you know, a watershed in history because of their achievement. And then we look back on it, and we're like, oh, we probably shouldn't have punished them for doing what they did. And, you know, he, he's being very positive, and he hopes that'll be the case. I, I would love to believe that, and, but I see where, you know, where America's moving, what direction it's moving in, and I think it's just becoming more morally bankrupt, and I think people, you know, a lot of these people who are anti-Silk Road or anti-Ross, a lot of them are, like, these liberal atheists, right? And liberal atheists pride themselves on not needing a god or a higher power, right? They pride themselves on thinking for themselves, yet they're actually replacing the belief in God, and originally Christianity was very anarchistic, and Christians were prosecuted for not worshipping the state in Rome, and if you read anything that Jesus said, he was a total anarchist and anti-authoritarian and pro-peace and non-violence, and these same, these very same people just replace religion with the worship for the state, which is a million times worse. And then they think that they're these progressive, you know, forward-thinking individuals, and a lot of them, you know, a lot of them should be anti-drug war, right? And a lot of them are anti-drug war, but, no, it doesn't count for the Silk Road, because Ross made a prophet, and prophet is evil, because they're all socialists. So, somehow, because Ross made a prophet from the Silk Road, negates any good that the Silk Road did. Exactly. Yeah, and, you know, as a follow-up, something you said a moment ago, too, when you were talking about the sentencing, and, you know, just how he was sentenced with murderers, rapists, violent criminals, I think that actually is something more than being morally bankrupt, is really the prison industrial complex, as people like to call it, and there's a profit incentive there, and how do you feel about that? Do you feel this is something that's isolated with Ross, or do you feel this is something that is a bigger problem? Well, specific to Ross, he's being, he's being crucified to set an example, that's all. Like, I knew he was going to get life, I didn't want to sit, like, I wanted, you know, I tried to have hope before it's completely, you know, in stone, and I still have hope for the appeal process, because on paper, there is, like, so many brass hooks to hang an appeal on, but I think he was made an example of, and I think Judge Forrest's only job, because of her influence from Chuck Schumer, was to make an example of him, and that's just the sad circumstance of his existence. He was the first, and he's going to be adequately punished, and everyone's going to know, and there's going to be a media campaign against him, and they're going to slander him to the point of labeling him as a murderer, whether or not it was proven, there wasn't even bodies, and the site was ran by their own feds at that point, and it's quite obvious that they faked it by now.",

Thanks for having me. So, all right, tell us what exactly is Brave the World? You summed it up pretty well. It's just anything that I find worthwhile exploring and delving into and sometimes standing up in the name of or against. So, I don't know, in the past I've attended CPAC and have asked very anarchistic questions. That was fun. That was one of my first projects. I did the protests at Bilderberg. I've been following the Silk Road case and doing some, I guess, reporting, but more, it's, I don't like to use the word reporting because I think journalists are blood-sucking scum. It's more of a moral support and ethical support in the name of free speech. So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, but I think that's good enough. So, Julia, where does the name Brave the World come from? Does it have an origin that means something to you? Yeah, so everyone knows Brave New World, right? So, instead of a brave new world, instead of embracing a brave new world, we should brave the world and go in the opposite direction. Very cool. And I actually had a question about what you were speaking on a few moments ago, and it had to do with your protesting Bilderberg and also your hatred of journalists because I think that there are awesome journalists and poor journalists like anything else. So, why is it that it took journalists so long to even figure out that Bilderberg is a thing? Because, well, this is the kind of stages of the status quo that we get fed. So, what you have first is complete denial, right? They deny that something's happened completely. Once that becomes harder to do, they label you as conspiracy theorists and say, oh, it's an over-Germanization. Once that becomes apparent that it's not true again, they accept the reality, and they accept that we know the reality, but they normalize it. So, Bilderberg, oh, it's no big deal. It's just a meeting of powerful people and families and politicians and those companies that are in charge of manufacturing arms meeting with potential presidents. No big deal. Oh, and nobody ever really knows when and where and the list is secret and they block off entire public streets and roads, but it's no big deal. Oh, and your taxes pay for it. No big deal. And your taxes also pay for their security. I believe the Copenhagen one cost over 100,000 euros just for security. And when I was there, I actually vined an endless stream of high-protection armored vehicles coming in and out of Bilderberg, the hotel that they were doing it at. You still with us, Julia? Uh-huh. Okay, cool. It sounded like you trailed off there for a second. Yeah, I don't remember the question now. I went on a tangent. I may have answered it. Bilderberg tends to get anyone going on a tangent, myself included, so it's a fascinating thing. Right, journalists. Yes. Right, so, again, and journalism has taken, like, I've been saying this for a little while now, journalism used to be a profession where it was okay to have a bias and an opinion. It was, in fact, encouraged. Now, to have a bias or an opinion is wrong. That's bad journalism. But the very fact that we deny that there's always a bias and then there's always an opinion when a journalist writes is more dishonest than having an outright bias. When you have something like a very obvious conflict and you give both sides of the story, even though one is obviously in the wrong, I think that's morally reprehensible and I think that it's dishonest because you're giving the same weight to something that might not deserve the same weight. So the entire concept of journalism has been bastardized to me and I hate when I'm called a journalist and even the journalists that I've worked with that are independent and in the libertarian and anarchist communities, I've learned to disrespect a lot of them as well because I've personally experienced some very dishonest activity. So that's really interesting. There's, behind, let's say, the Bilderbergs, right, there's, like, this core philosophy that it seems like you sort of centered a lot of your work around. Could you describe for our listeners sort of what is it about, you know, bad actors in journalism, bad actors at the Bilderberg system that you're really getting at here philosophically? Well, I understand having a kind of motivational factor of gain, right, so, but it's become so, it's become the sole purpose of people being a journalist. So you get even people that are supposed to be morally honest and doing good, like people in the libertarian movement, that that is the standard they claim to be on, you know, non-aggression, you know, they're not not-profit, but I keep seeing people solely focusing on clickbait and recently something happened where there was a private letter that Ross Ulbrich sent to a very popular libertarian radio show to an individual from that show saying, thanks for supporting me, blah, blah, blah, and he said a few private things in the letter which were meant to be private, and they went and published it as a headline saying, the first public letter from Ross Ulbrich, that is incredibly inappropriate, and the things that were in the letter actually had the potential of hurting him because of the position he's in. His lawyers were very worried, and his mother asked the people directly to take it down, and they wouldn't take it down until Ross spent his call quota and his own money, which he has almost none left, to call them and ask them to take it down. So I'm seeing this dishonesty in the name of profit, even in our own community, and Ross has written, they're not the first people to get a letter from Ross, I know many people that have gotten letters from Ross, and they did not go ahead and publish it. I did not publish my letters on my blog from Ross, because I assume that they're private. You know, and I think that the main word there is assume, when it comes to that, and it's really interesting when it comes to private communication, as what is private and what is public, and it really comes down to what you make private and what you make public, and I'm probably the oddest one of the whole decentralized group here, because I have not made a certain, I haven't taken a stance on the Ross situation, because I think obviously what he did is, you know, the freedom part of me says, oh, who cares, it's to each his own, but then the other part of me goes, well, when you play with fire and you get burned, and then you see that he got life in prison, and I as a taxpayer have to pay for that, that is what bothers me actually the most. So I'm actually, you know, very interested in that more than anything else is the sentence. Well, you should be upset with the state for having to pay those taxes, not with Ross, right? Absolutely, and that's, yeah, absolutely, and the judge. Mm-hmm, and I mean, the whole, I just, I've been, I've had two interviews before this too, and there's one thing I just keep reiterating. The whole thing of whether Ross is guilty or not, and there's been a lot of finger pointing at his supporters, saying that we've been inconsistent, oh, one minute he's not DPR, the next minute he's, is DPR, but go anti-drug war. We have not changed our tune. His supporters maintain that he's innocent, and let me explain what we mean by innocent. If Ross is DPR the whole time, started it throughout, the only person who was DPR, if he was DPR some of the time, and multiple DPRs are involved, he wasn't DPR at all. All of those make him still innocent, because at the end of the day, the Silk Road reduced harm, saved lives, and took violence off the streets. That is not even negotiable. So in an ethical sense, he is innocent. In the law sense, he's guilty, but, you know, so are people in, that follow the Muslim religion, and are under, Muslim law, that drink breast milk on the third full moon of the year, they're guilty to be punishable by death. So I mean, if you're guilty by law, anything can be made illegal, right? This whole trial situation and sentencing with Ross is the way it has me sick to my stomach, and it's been pretty upsetting for a lot of people, I'm sure. I understand you were at the trial. Were you also present at the sentencing, and can you tell us a little bit about your experience with either of those? Yeah, I was at the trial, and if anybody wants to just get up to date with how it went down, I have very thorough videos on my channel, and it's Brave the World channel on YouTube. You can just search it, it's easy. Or my website, bravetheworld.com. But yeah, the trial itself was daunting, they really dragged it out, the prosecution was very brutal, and they pandered to their audience, which was a jury of his peers, which was not, because they were all, most of them were government workers, and very basic people, not to be rude, but a jury of his peers would be at least university graduates, at least people that are somewhat technologically savvy, at least people that are under 40 years old. So it was not a jury of his peers. So the entire process was pretty horrific, and again, the behavior from journalists was incredibly inappropriate. I was misquoted, Lynn was misquoted, and then the same people who misquote us for their clicks come to our faces and say, oh, can I get another interview with you? So, I mean, that was not a fun time. I did get a flight to go see him during the sentencing, but then the sentencing changed after I already booked my flight, and I just didn't have the means. I had to change it back, and I decided to go home instead. So one of the things you talked about a little bit earlier was this idea that things can be against the law by the state or by a central authority, but still morally correct, right? Or morally, or the inverse, things can be morally wrong and still perfectly legal. One of the things I think you pursued, a lot of people pursued very early on in sort of the trial, was this idea of jury nullification, where if the jury feels that the law itself is unjust, they can, you know, not convict the person in the court. They can actually basically nullify that law for that sentence. Yeah. That's a constitutional right. But the judge, right before the jury went to deliberate, she actually said, even if you don't agree with the law, you still have to judge according to the law. So she was alluding to the fact that jury nullification exists. She knew that most of those people are uninformed, but she still took the precaution to dismiss any, you know, cloudiness in their mind in case they were leaning in that direction. So she was very adamant about being against the concept of jury nullification. The law is the law, and, you know, he did this, this, and this, therefore he broke this, this, and that law, therefore he's guilty. Morality or, you know, that did not count. Yeah, it was kind of tragic, and now it's kind of an inverse state where the state is the one committing the violence against a morally innocent individual, right? And that's sort of the travesty of it all. What is the role? Go ahead. In murderers? Like, does he, that is, that is a complete infringement on any kind of human rights, even by the most, like, by the most basic standards. Well, and what's interesting is in the community, you know, everybody feels that he largely helped to remove violence from the system. So what do you think is the role? What can we gain from this, and what can we do today, first and foremost? And then what can we do to make sure that things like this, this absurdity doesn't ever happen again? Jeffrey Tucker wrote a cool article, and he named Russell Brick the Socrates of today, and he named all of these historic characters that were prosecuted for being, you know, a trailblazer, and making, like, a water, you know, a watershed in history because of their achievement. And then we look back on it, and we're like, oh, we probably shouldn't have punished them for doing what they did. And, you know, he, he's being very positive, and he hopes that'll be the case. I, I would love to believe that, and, but I see where, you know, where America's moving, what direction it's moving in, and I think it's just becoming more morally bankrupt, and I think people, you know, a lot of these people who are anti-Silk Road or anti-Ross, a lot of them are, like, these liberal atheists, right? And liberal atheists pride themselves on not needing a god or a higher power, right? They pride themselves on thinking for themselves, yet they're actually replacing the belief in God, and originally Christianity was very anarchistic, and Christians were prosecuted for not worshipping the state in Rome, and if you read anything that Jesus said, he was a total anarchist and anti-authoritarian and pro-peace and non-violence, and these same, these very same people just replace religion with the worship for the state, which is a million times worse. And then they think that they're these progressive, you know, forward-thinking individuals, and a lot of them, you know, a lot of them should be anti-drug war, right? And a lot of them are anti-drug war, but, no, it doesn't count for the Silk Road, because Ross made a prophet, and prophet is evil, because they're all socialists. So, somehow, because Ross made a prophet from the Silk Road, negates any good that the Silk Road did. Exactly. Yeah, and, you know, as a follow-up, something you said a moment ago, too, when you were talking about the sentencing, and, you know, just how he was sentenced with murderers, rapists, violent criminals, I think that actually is something more than being morally bankrupt, is really the prison industrial complex, as people like to call it, and there's a profit incentive there, and how do you feel about that? Do you feel this is something that's isolated with Ross, or do you feel this is something that is a bigger problem? Well, specific to Ross, he's being, he's being crucified to set an example, that's all. Like, I knew he was going to get life, I didn't want to sit, like, I wanted, you know, I tried to have hope before it's completely, you know, in stone, and I still have hope for the appeal process, because on paper, there is, like, so many brass hooks to hang an appeal on, but I think he was made an example of, and I think Judge Forrest's only job, because of her influence from Chuck Schumer, was to make an example of him, and that's just the sad circumstance of his existence. He was the first, and he's going to be adequately punished, and everyone's going to know, and there's going to be a media campaign against him, and they're going to slander him to the point of labeling him as a murderer, whether or not it was proven, there wasn't even bodies, and the site was ran by their own feds at that point, and it's quite obvious that they faked it by now.",
