{"text": " Right, and possibly for two different reasons. That's a multiple levels thing, yeah. Exactly. And I don't know, they're just so recognizable. I mean, there's a reason that, you know, when like the new Smurfs movie came out, people weren't going like, oh my God, there's a Smurf on a billboard. I gotta go see this thing. But you see Kermit on a billboard and it's like, there's something really exciting about that and maybe you do have to go see that, that new movie or whatever it is. I mean, not a lot of people said that about Muppets Most Wanted. Not enough people. But, you know, there was at least more than like the Marmaduke movie. So why do you think that happened? Because Muppets Most Wanted didn't perform as well at the box office as the Muppets did, right? It performed beneath expectations, let's just say. Yes, that's accurate. So like, why did that happen? What happened between those two movies? Or was it just that the second one didn't have Jason Segel or what's going on there? I don't know. We've speculated a lot if it was the time of year that it opened or it opened just like the week after, a couple weeks after Mr. Peabody. Some people said maybe. I feel like a big reason was there was no urgency. With the first Muppet movie, I'm sorry, the 2011 Muppet movie, it was the Muppets are back. You have to go see, because the Muppets are back. You haven't seen them in years. With this one, it was just another story. It was like, oh, I just saw the Muppets three years ago. It's no big deal. I also had a lot of beef with like, you know, the posters, for example, all used photography that they took years ago. It had nothing to do with the movie. It had nothing to do with, you know, we didn't give anyone a reason to, you know, go see like this crazy new story about this heist or, you know, to see Ricky Gervais doing something funny. Other than just like looking into the camera and smiling. And for whatever reason, people really didn't understand the thing of Kermit has an evil twin. Because a co-worker actually just asked me this week, why did I see Kermit talking on TV with a Russian accent? Yeah, I know. It's, yeah. So I don't know if it's more like the movie itself was, I think it's more of the movie itself was not promoted while the Muppets were promoted. Right. And the Muppets were promoted. Oh, they were everywhere. I don't think, like, I never thought this day would come, but I am no longer that excited when the Muppets show up in an internet video. It's like, you know, they do it so much. They do. And like, it's because everyone loves them. Everyone wants to work with them. But like, they, I mean, do you guys see that? Like, it seems like they're, I guess it's cool how the internet has like opened up this like new forum for them to appear in things. But like, I don't know. Are they doing more and more? I think so. You guys probably know better than anyone. You're tracking their. They're definitely keeping busy. I feel like there was a bit of a lull after the most recent movie just because from what we heard, they changed. Hands within the Disney hierarchy. But one thing that to keep in mind about the Muppets is that because they're actual physical puppets, physical characters, and not like an animation that needs, you know, days, weeks, months, I don't know how long to render. They can just grab a puppet, grab a celebrity, write a quick song, whatever it takes, and just get it up there and get it on YouTube. Yeah, exactly. They appeared at an NBA game recently. Which team was that? LA Clippers, I think. Yeah, they went to a Clippers game recently. Yeah, well, you saw Sweetums throw out a pitch at a Brooklyn Cyclones game. I actually didn't see that. I just missed that because I was stuck on the subway. Oh, sorry. That was at a sore spot for you. I'm sorry. What do you guys, when you talk to the people who perform the Muppets, what do you, first of all, are they like, is there a type of person who performs the Muppets? Is it a diverse group? What are they like? Oh, they're all assholes. It's hard to imagine anyone who is performing as a Muppet, anyone who's like devoted their life to puppetry is an asshole. They're all like, get out of my face, kid. I'm a Muppet. The cool thing about the Muppeteers is that because they're all below the screen and you don't see their face at all, there are these amazing, hilarious, talented performers, but there's no ego at all. They're not in it to become famous. If they were, they would not be puppeteers. They would be actors or whatever. And that lack of ego makes them just the nicest people in Hollywood. We've never met one who wasn't super nice. That's true. People left from that original Muppeteer generation. Almost all the performers started as Muppet fans. So like, they're just excited to be here. They're carrying on the legacy and they want to. Yeah. Yeah. They're as excited about it as we are. What do you guys ask them? Like, what do you want? What do you want to know when you talk to one of them? Can we hang out? Can we be best friends? That's what I want to know. Yeah. They've all said no so far. So far. Yeah. We just ask them about their careers, how they got into the Muppets. I mean, it seems like it's Muppet or bust if you're going to be a puppeteer, right? That's the weird thing about being a puppeteer is like, really, there's only a couple of places to go if you're going to try to get to the top of the mountain. Most of them want to, I guess. So how did they get into it? Most of them really just like at a very young age, they started building their own puppets or performing, you know, like in their backyards or whatever. And kind of, I think every one of them had to make that choice probably around college of like, am I pursuing this as a career? Is this not just a hobby? I think it is. It's like when you, I guess it's like joining like a really good division one football team. You know, you're like, all right, this is it. I'm going for this. We're going, we're good. We're trying to go pro here. Yeah, pretty much. And do you talk, have you seen the Muppets performed live? Like where, under what context? Well, we've been on the Sesame Street set a few times. Oh my God. That's incredible. What is that like? Tell me about that. Well, actually I should back up and say the first time that we ever saw Muppets perform, Ryan and I got to go to the set of this not so great Muppet TV special called Letters to Santa, which was a Christmas special. So you guys just friends with the Muppet industry at this point? It's really like, well, there's so few Muppet fan sites out there. There's two and a half, I'd say. You kind of get noticed. Yeah. Yeah. So like really, we are their audience. I mean, it's a very small circle. There's only a few people who do what we do. So they invite you. So this one was, I had actually just shown up at, I found out they were filming outside. In Brooklyn Heights. And so I just went and I just stood outside and watched them film for a while. And then I got the courage to, I mean, this was how many years ago? This was like eight years ago. Yeah. And I just got the courage to like go up to Steve Whitmire, who performs Kermit the Frog and just be like, Hey, I'm sorry. I just want to say hello. I'm Joe. I run Tough Bigs. And I just kind of expect him to be like, Oh, Oh, that's interesting. And he was like, Tough Bigs. That's awesome. I love your site. And he's like, well, come with me. And he brought me backstage. They don't always know who we are, but a lot of them, most of them do at least have heard of the website. That's true. And, and they, because of that, they invited Ryan and I to go visit the sets while they were filming indoors. And we got to interview Steve Whitmire that day. We got to just sit and watch them film for an entire day, which was, I mean, just amazing. What surprised you about that? What did you see? It was interesting. One thing they, they did that. I think one of the writers actually like said as an aside to us, sometimes you write something, not realizing how hard it will be for the Muppets to do because they like, they can't use their hands. For example, there was a tag in that special where they were going through airport security and Rizzo tells Pepe that he has to put his electronic devices in a bin. Pepe has four arms. So he had an electronic device in each arm. So he says, Blackberry, Blueberry, and he's with each arm he's putting them. So they had to have, I guess, was it three puppeteers? At least. It may have been one puppeteer per, per arm. And then Bill Beretta doing Pepe's head. And then like one would fall out of his hand and they'd have to start over again. And it just took many, many takes to do one simple gag that probably was on screen for like six seconds. Yeah. That's cool. That's cool. What about Sesame Street? What was being there like? Sesame Street's amazing. I mean, like that's where I learned how to read. Totally. Yeah. I literally learned how to read things. Yeah. That one was more emotional for me than anything. Just because you're like, we walk on the set for the first time. I remember and being like, Oh my God, it's the stoop. Oh my God, it's Oscar's can. Like they let us go inside the can. And I remember when we were leaving later on in the day, we were walking through a room that had a burden of Ernie's beds and we were like, no, he's around. And like we had someone take a picture of me and Ryan both like inside the beds. That's amazing. Just insane, man. It's just insane. Also the, the kind of amazing thing that I found is we've been there a couple of times. So you see it with like the, you see the end of the street and it's the studio floor and you see the lights overhead and everything. But then when I turn on the TV show and watch it, I still see Sesame Street. Right. I'm not thinking about the lights just outside the frame. Right. It's still the same place. When you see the characters perform live, is the illusion real? Like, do you see the person performing it at all? Are you locking eyes with the character? For the most part, I think I only see the character. Cause some of the performers, like they just like, all of their energy is going through their hands at that point. Leslie Carrara, who plays Abby Cadabby is, is one of those people who like, like she'll see someone like hanging out on the side of this, of a, you know, off, off set. And she'll be like, like grab Abby, put the puppet on and be like, hi, how you doing? Like just in your face. And like, you don't see the person. You don't see Leslie at all. I mean, it's all Abby. It is kind of interesting and fun to, to watch them though. Just to like, kind of look at the puppet, look at the puppeteer, look at the puppet. Although then at a certain point you look at the puppeteer and it's kind of like, oh, why is that lady talking in Abby Cadabby's voice? Why is she lip syncing everything that Abby Cadabby is saying? I think the only times I can, that I can think of that, uh, like you look at the puppet, uh, and they're not just 100% like there is when it's a puppet that probably takes a lot more energy to, to perform. Uh, recently, I got to see Matt Vogel playing Big Bird, who is the understudy for Carol Spinney. And, um, just because Big Bird's a very large puppet and he's heavy. And, uh, we were also in a rush doing everything we were doing. I mean, I think I've seen that diagram online. Yeah. Like you got one hand up in the air, right? That's right. For the beak. And then one, and then the other hand is going through the right hand or I'm going to use a wing for one wing. Yeah. The other wing is, uh, empty, but there's a string that can, like it goes up through the neck and then down to the other wing. So when one goes up, the other one goes down. Which you really don't notice on, on the show unless you're looking for it. That's true. They do a really good job of hiding that. Yeah. Making that invisible. But yeah, like the, like sometimes the puppeteers are just like, I need to get this thing that's on camera and I'm not going to keep the puppet up just, you know, for, you know, waiting for the next take. Like it's, you know. Yeah. Your hand's in the air. I just demonstrate that even though no one can see you holding my hand in the air. It's hard. I'm tired. I'm tired. Yeah. Now do that for three hours. Yeah. Although it was weird. In a giant bird suit. Last time Ryan and I were on set together, we saw Snuffy, which was also. Snuffy walked away. Amazing. Walked right past us. Walked right past us. But the weird thing was, I don't know if you really remember this. They, uh, you know, there's a second puppeteer obviously for the, for the hind legs and, um, they're like the seam was open so that he could get some air, I guess, before they started filming. Because they were shooting it. So it was just like Snuffy, like completely like gutted open with a human being inside. Like as if he like swallowed somebody. Yes, exactly. Awesome. That was a little, that was a little, uh, discomforting I think. I thought you were just going to comment on how well synchronized they were. They were. I've been doing it for so long. It's like Snuffy moves like one, one creature with just four legs. Yes. How does a follow that bird hold up? Cause that was, when I was a kid, my mom will still bring up that I cried a lot when big bird was painted. It's sad. Very devastating for me as a child. I love that movie. I love follow that bird. I love it. You're hesitant. No, I love it with some, I can just see the flaws in it more than I could obviously when I was like five years old. I don't, I can't even think of a flaw. What are the flaws? Isn't it weird that they made, I mean, what's the deal? With that movie? Cause it's, it is strange to take, um, Sesame street who, like we were saying, the Muppets weren't designed to teach numbers. You're taking those Sesame street characters who were and putting them into a narrative movie, which is more what the Muppets were designed. Right. Writers probably like it when they get to do that stuff. Right. They definitely got to branch out cause they're not teaching letters and numbers. Now they're T they're doing a whole 70 minute story and follow that bird. Well, it's more of like, uh, you know, messages about family and friendship and responsibility and things like that. And that it's okay to jump from a moving truck. If a grownup gives you permission. That's right. That's important. Yes. Um, but, uh, then, you know, they had a second movie in the nineties called Elmo and Grouchland, which is not as good. It's much younger. Yeah. It's a much cheaper looking movie. I never saw that because I was, you know, it's not worth your time. It seemed like that one seemed more like what's cool about follow that bird is it's like big birds run amok on earth, you know, like big birds, like on a cross country voyage. That one's a little more in Muppet world, isn't it? Yes. Well, he goes to Grouchland. Yeah. Grouchland. It still makes follow that bird stand out as a little more unique. So Grouchland is like not educational. It's just like Elmo's adventure. No, there's, there's something educational about it. It's whatever it is. Like, yeah, it's well, it's like, I guess like learning to be brave. Well, there's definitely, it's been so long since I've seen the movie, but there's definitely moments when like the action stops and Elmo's like, well, we got to figure out how to do this. And like, it's just like, you got to some sort of logic or whatever that the kids are thinking, encouraged to like shout at the screen. Maybe I like a door to the Explorer thing, which is exactly what you want to hear in a movie theater. Yeah. Right. Like Elmo, if Elmo's not actively teaching me something, my tolerance for Elmo drops a lot. Like, I feel like Elmo gets away with a lot because he's educational. No, see, I think it's the opposite. I think Elmo is the most entertaining when he's just like allowed to go nuts. Elmo on talk shows is usually hilarious. It's hysterical. Now when he's, when he has to like teach, you know, the letter D, like maybe we're a little stuck with, with the educational content. Do you guys ever see the video? And I just remember when you said Elmo on a talk show. It used to be one of my favorite videos online. And I haven't thought about in a while with Cookie Monster on Martha Stewart show. Oh yeah. Cookie Monster's like, he seems like he's legitimately upsetting Martha Stewart. He is. Like what's the story there? The story is that Frank Oz is awesome. So first of all, pause, pause, go search Cookie Monster, Martha Stewart. You'll find it. All right, now they're back. What's up with that amazing video? Frank Oz does not give a fuck. That's what it comes down to. So that's Frank Oz. Cause like, I mean, that's a fairly recent video. Frank Oz still performs Muppets. Very rarely. He doesn't do the, the Muppet show characters anymore. He doesn't do Piggy, Fozzy, Animal, but he's every once in a while he shows up for Sesame Street stuff. From what I hear, it's like every other year he'll do like a day on, on set. Cool. I totally still does that. Yeah, I think he just does it. I mean like, a part of me is a little upset about the fact that like Frank Oz is genuinely one of the, if not one of the, he is the best puppeteer in the world. Like, I mean, he's just an amazing talent. Absolutely hysterical. But, oh, someone's ringing. he, um, just doesn't, Let's plow through it. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's cool. So, uh, yeah, so he's one of the best puppeteers in the world, but he, um, doesn't perform anymore. Like he just wants to direct and he's a good director. He's made some great movies. But he's not the greatest, greatest director in the world. That's true. That's like Picasso being like, you know, I'm going to try playing the guitar. Or Jordan playing baseball, I guess. Yeah, exactly. I see that, but at the same time, I think, you know, he's given us decades and decades of genius work. I think we can let him relax. But is he relaxing? I don't know. I don't know what genuinely, Frank Oz, what is Frank Oz doing right now? Well, he just got married. He didn't know. So that's Frank Oz on Martha Stewart. And he was just like, fuck it. And just like went for it. Yeah. Cause I think he also, like Frank Oz got to a point in his career where he's like, what are you gonna do? Fire me? Yeah, exactly. I'm fucking Cookie Monster. I'm Cookie Monster. Yeah. So Martha Stewart seems legitimately upset in that video. It's such a funny video. I think she wasn't expecting it. Yeah. There's also one of, um, Frank as Miss Piggy with Martha Stewart. That's almost as funny. Oh, well, the other one I was just going to mention is, uh, Miss Piggy on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno when they had her on for New Year's Eve. I don't remember what year it is. It's definitely on YouTube, but how old is it? Like 90? It's the 90. I want to say it's like 96 to 97, something like that. So they, so they have Miss Piggy on the top of some building in Times Square reporting live to, for the New Year's Eve thing. And you can kind of tell as they check in with Miss Piggy throughout the hour that Frank Oz is getting increasingly cranky. So we hear it was freezing cold. So they just wanted to, they're just waiting for midnight. So they can get the hell out of there. Yeah. By the end, he's just kind of like, he's screaming, he's yelling at people off camera. Who cares? There's a ball. It's going to drop. The ball is dropping. All right. So we're running out of time. One more, one last thing that we haven't talked about yet that people should see to really appreciate the genius of the Muppets from each of you. Let's get one more from each of you. Ryan, what are you thinking? I should be thinking about this while you're talking. Well, that's not fair. And go. Did I name an episode of the Muppet Show yet? No, I did. Yeah. Wow. I got to think about this. Well, here, while you're thinking, I got one. I'm going to brag for a second. Have you seen Big Birdman? No. It's a Birdman. I haven't seen Birdman yet. It's a Birdman spoof that I actually pitched a spoof of Birdman to the people of Sesame Street and got to write a script that eventually became a thing. That's incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. And it went viral. It went like crazy viral, like three quarters of a million views on YouTube. And the great thing about it was it's not just like we're spoofing a popular movie, but like we got to use Carol Spinney as himself. So Carol Spinney has been playing Big Bird for 40 some years. And it really was nice to, I mean, first of all, it's amazing to get to work with him, but like it's really great to see that Carol Spinney got a little bit of a spotlight as himself, not just as Big Bird. Well, there's that documentary out about him now too, right? Yes. I am Big Bird. Fantastic. That's about to open in theaters all over the country. Yeah. Beginning of March. So, I mean, but really the great thing about Big Birdman is more about, you know, what Sesame Street is doing nowadays, which is they're still doing like really amazing spoofs and they're still getting like crazy amounts of attention on YouTube and they're still like relevant, which is awesome. For a show that's 46 years old, you know, a puppet show for preschoolers, for people to care about it still, like still blows my mind. It's for preschoolers and people who watch YouTube. That's right. And for you and me. Yes, exactly. Mostly for you and me. That's right. I would recommend for Disney fans at least to watch the Muppets at Walt Disney World, which is a TV special that was one of the last things Jim Henson ever worked on. It was at the time when he was intending to sell the company to Disney in 1990. And they made this special, which is basically the Muppets running amok at Disney World. And it's just like they go to all three parks at the time. And it's all these, like pretty much every Muppet character gets something to do within the hour. And it's just really funny and fun and has great songs. It is. And tragically, not on DVD, which makes no sense. No, it's never been released. It's Disney. Disney owns the Muppets now. Yeah, it should be a DVD extra somewhere, but it hasn't been. Are you guys happy with how Disney has treated the Muppets now that they own them? Mostly. Except, you know, ignoring the fact they shut down the ride in the LA theme park. We won't let that slide just for this moment. You say mostly. I say mostly not. I feel like between, what was that, 2001 and 2011? 2004 was when they bought them. 2004. Yeah, it took them a while to make anything. Almost nothing. Like, that's awful. Wait, when did they buy them? 2004. And then, yeah, I mean, and then not really anything until the movie in 2011. Exactly. Yeah. So I feel like every once in a while, and still, like, we'll get like these, like a push of like, there's Muppets all over YouTube, or there's like a new Muppets special coming out, or a movie, or whatever. And then silence. Okay. We did that now. Let's take a few years off. And I'm also like upset about the fact that like, they've never figured out how to merchandise the Muppets since they've owned them. Like, how do we not have Muppets stuff? How hard is it to get like cool plush, more DVDs, anything? And they're really just kind of like, every once in a while, they're like, there's a little something, and we don't really want it. I did buy a few little adorable Muppet dolls at Hallmark, the Hallmark store for the weekend. So there's that. That is a good license for Disney to have. Those are very cute. Yes. So, you know, I always have high hopes that, you know,", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.34, "text": " Right, and possibly for two different reasons.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [1779, 11, 293,

That's a multiple levels thing, yeah. Exactly. And I don't know, they're just so recognizable. I mean, there's a reason that, you know, when like the new Smurfs movie came out, people weren't going like, oh my God, there's a Smurf on a billboard. I gotta go see this thing. But you see Kermit on a billboard and it's like, there's something really exciting about that and maybe you do have to go see that, that new movie or whatever it is. I mean, not a lot of people said that about Muppets Most Wanted. Not enough people. But, you know, there was at least more than like the Marmaduke movie. So why do you think that happened? Because Muppets Most Wanted didn't perform as well at the box office as the Muppets did, right? It performed beneath expectations, let's just say. Yes, that's accurate. So like, why did that happen? What happened between those two movies? Or was it just that the second one didn't have Jason Segel or what's going on there? I don't know. We've speculated a lot if it was the time of year that it opened or it opened just like the week after, a couple weeks after Mr. Peabody. Some people said maybe. I feel like a big reason was there was no urgency. With the first Muppet movie, I'm sorry, the 2011 Muppet movie, it was the Muppets are back. You have to go see, because the Muppets are back. You haven't seen them in years. With this one, it was just another story. It was like, oh, I just saw the Muppets three years ago. It's no big deal. I also had a lot of beef with like, you know, the posters, for example, all used photography that they took years ago. It had nothing to do with the movie. It had nothing to do with, you know, we didn't give anyone a reason to, you know, go see like this crazy new story about this heist or, you know, to see Ricky Gervais doing something funny. Other than just like looking into the camera and smiling. And for whatever reason, people really didn't understand the thing of Kermit has an evil twin. Because a co-worker actually just asked me this week, why did I see Kermit talking on TV with a Russian accent? Yeah, I know. It's, yeah. So I don't know if it's more like the movie itself was, I think it's more of the movie itself was not promoted while the Muppets were promoted. Right. And the Muppets were promoted. Oh, they were everywhere. I don't think, like, I never thought this day would come, but I am no longer that excited when the Muppets show up in an internet video. It's like, you know, they do it so much. They do. And like, it's because everyone loves them. Everyone wants to work with them. But like, they, I mean, do you guys see that? Like, it seems like they're, I guess it's cool how the internet has like opened up this like new forum for them to appear in things. But like, I don't know. Are they doing more and more? I think so. You guys probably know better than anyone. You're tracking their. They're definitely keeping busy. I feel like there was a bit of a lull after the most recent movie just because from what we heard, they changed. Hands within the Disney hierarchy. But one thing that to keep in mind about the Muppets is that because they're actual physical puppets, physical characters, and not like an animation that needs, you know, days, weeks, months, I don't know how long to render. They can just grab a puppet, grab a celebrity, write a quick song, whatever it takes, and just get it up there and get it on YouTube. Yeah, exactly. They appeared at an NBA game recently. Which team was that? LA Clippers, I think. Yeah, they went to a Clippers game recently. Yeah, well, you saw Sweetums throw out a pitch at a Brooklyn Cyclones game. I actually didn't see that. I just missed that because I was stuck on the subway. Oh, sorry. That was at a sore spot for you. I'm sorry. What do you guys, when you talk to the people who perform the Muppets, what do you, first of all, are they like, is there a type of person who performs the Muppets? Is it a diverse group? What are they like? Oh, they're all assholes. It's hard to imagine anyone who is performing as a Muppet, anyone who's like devoted their life to puppetry is an asshole. They're all like, get out of my face, kid. I'm a Muppet. The cool thing about the Muppeteers is that because they're all below the screen and you don't see their face at all, there are these amazing, hilarious, talented performers, but there's no ego at all. They're not in it to become famous. If they were, they would not be puppeteers. They would be actors or whatever. And that lack of ego makes them just the nicest people in Hollywood. We've never met one who wasn't super nice. That's true. People left from that original Muppeteer generation. Almost all the performers started as Muppet fans. So like, they're just excited to be here. They're carrying on the legacy and they want to. Yeah. Yeah. They're as excited about it as we are. What do you guys ask them? Like, what do you want? What do you want to know when you talk to one of them? Can we hang out? Can we be best friends? That's what I want to know. Yeah. They've all said no so far. So far. Yeah. We just ask them about their careers, how they got into the Muppets. I mean, it seems like it's Muppet or bust if you're going to be a puppeteer, right? That's the weird thing about being a puppeteer is like, really, there's only a couple of places to go if you're going to try to get to the top of the mountain. Most of them want to, I guess. So how did they get into it? Most of them really just like at a very young age, they started building their own puppets or performing, you know, like in their backyards or whatever. And kind of, I think every one of them had to make that choice probably around college of like, am I pursuing this as a career? Is this not just a hobby? I think it is. It's like when you, I guess it's like joining like a really good division one football team. You know, you're like, all right, this is it. I'm going for this. We're going, we're good. We're trying to go pro here. Yeah, pretty much. And do you talk, have you seen the Muppets performed live? Like where, under what context? Well, we've been on the Sesame Street set a few times. Oh my God. That's incredible. What is that like? Tell me about that. Well, actually I should back up and say the first time that we ever saw Muppets perform, Ryan and I got to go to the set of this not so great Muppet TV special called Letters to Santa, which was a Christmas special. So you guys just friends with the Muppet industry at this point? It's really like, well, there's so few Muppet fan sites out there. There's two and a half, I'd say. You kind of get noticed. Yeah. Yeah. So like really, we are their audience. I mean, it's a very small circle. There's only a few people who do what we do. So they invite you. So this one was, I had actually just shown up at, I found out they were filming outside. In Brooklyn Heights. And so I just went and I just stood outside and watched them film for a while. And then I got the courage to, I mean, this was how many years ago? This was like eight years ago. Yeah. And I just got the courage to like go up to Steve Whitmire, who performs Kermit the Frog and just be like, Hey, I'm sorry. I just want to say hello. I'm Joe. I run Tough Bigs. And I just kind of expect him to be like, Oh, Oh, that's interesting. And he was like, Tough Bigs. That's awesome. I love your site. And he's like, well, come with me. And he brought me backstage. They don't always know who we are, but a lot of them, most of them do at least have heard of the website. That's true. And, and they, because of that, they invited Ryan and I to go visit the sets while they were filming indoors. And we got to interview Steve Whitmire that day. We got to just sit and watch them film for an entire day, which was, I mean, just amazing. What surprised you about that? What did you see? It was interesting. One thing they, they did that. I think one of the writers actually like said as an aside to us, sometimes you write something, not realizing how hard it will be for the Muppets to do because they like, they can't use their hands. For example, there was a tag in that special where they were going through airport security and Rizzo tells Pepe that he has to put his electronic devices in a bin. Pepe has four arms. So he had an electronic device in each arm. So he says, Blackberry, Blueberry, and he's with each arm he's putting them. So they had to have, I guess, was it three puppeteers? At least. It may have been one puppeteer per, per arm. And then Bill Beretta doing Pepe's head. And then like one would fall out of his hand and they'd have to start over again. And it just took many, many takes to do one simple gag that probably was on screen for like six seconds. Yeah. That's cool. That's cool. What about Sesame Street? What was being there like? Sesame Street's amazing. I mean, like that's where I learned how to read. Totally. Yeah. I literally learned how to read things. Yeah. That one was more emotional for me than anything. Just because you're like, we walk on the set for the first time. I remember and being like, Oh my God, it's the stoop. Oh my God, it's Oscar's can. Like they let us go inside the can. And I remember when we were leaving later on in the day, we were walking through a room that had a burden of Ernie's beds and we were like, no, he's around. And like we had someone take a picture of me and Ryan both like inside the beds. That's amazing. Just insane, man. It's just insane. Also the, the kind of amazing thing that I found is we've been there a couple of times. So you see it with like the, you see the end of the street and it's the studio floor and you see the lights overhead and everything. But then when I turn on the TV show and watch it, I still see Sesame Street. Right. I'm not thinking about the lights just outside the frame. Right. It's still the same place. When you see the characters perform live, is the illusion real? Like, do you see the person performing it at all? Are you locking eyes with the character? For the most part, I think I only see the character. Cause some of the performers, like they just like, all of their energy is going through their hands at that point. Leslie Carrara, who plays Abby Cadabby is, is one of those people who like, like she'll see someone like hanging out on the side of this, of a, you know, off, off set. And she'll be like, like grab Abby, put the puppet on and be like, hi, how you doing? Like just in your face. And like, you don't see the person. You don't see Leslie at all. I mean, it's all Abby. It is kind of interesting and fun to, to watch them though. Just to like, kind of look at the puppet, look at the puppeteer, look at the puppet. Although then at a certain point you look at the puppeteer and it's kind of like, oh, why is that lady talking in Abby Cadabby's voice? Why is she lip syncing everything that Abby Cadabby is saying? I think the only times I can, that I can think of that, uh, like you look at the puppet, uh, and they're not just 100% like there is when it's a puppet that probably takes a lot more energy to, to perform. Uh, recently, I got to see Matt Vogel playing Big Bird, who is the understudy for Carol Spinney. And, um, just because Big Bird's a very large puppet and he's heavy. And, uh, we were also in a rush doing everything we were doing. I mean, I think I've seen that diagram online. Yeah. Like you got one hand up in the air, right? That's right. For the beak. And then one, and then the other hand is going through the right hand or I'm going to use a wing for one wing. Yeah. The other wing is, uh, empty, but there's a string that can, like it goes up through the neck and then down to the other wing. So when one goes up, the other one goes down. Which you really don't notice on, on the show unless you're looking for it. That's true. They do a really good job of hiding that. Yeah. Making that invisible. But yeah, like the, like sometimes the puppeteers are just like, I need to get this thing that's on camera and I'm not going to keep the puppet up just, you know, for, you know, waiting for the next take. Like it's, you know. Yeah. Your hand's in the air. I just demonstrate that even though no one can see you holding my hand in the air. It's hard. I'm tired. I'm tired. Yeah. Now do that for three hours. Yeah. Although it was weird. In a giant bird suit. Last time Ryan and I were on set together, we saw Snuffy, which was also. Snuffy walked away. Amazing. Walked right past us. Walked right past us. But the weird thing was, I don't know if you really remember this. They, uh, you know, there's a second puppeteer obviously for the, for the hind legs and, um, they're like the seam was open so that he could get some air, I guess, before they started filming. Because they were shooting it. So it was just like Snuffy, like completely like gutted open with a human being inside. Like as if he like swallowed somebody. Yes, exactly. Awesome. That was a little, that was a little, uh, discomforting I think. I thought you were just going to comment on how well synchronized they were. They were. I've been doing it for so long. It's like Snuffy moves like one, one creature with just four legs. Yes. How does a follow that bird hold up? Cause that was, when I was a kid, my mom will still bring up that I cried a lot when big bird was painted. It's sad. Very devastating for me as a child. I love that movie. I love follow that bird. I love it. You're hesitant. No, I love it with some, I can just see the flaws in it more than I could obviously when I was like five years old. I don't, I can't even think of a flaw. What are the flaws? Isn't it weird that they made, I mean, what's the deal? With that movie? Cause it's, it is strange to take, um, Sesame street who, like we were saying, the Muppets weren't designed to teach numbers. You're taking those Sesame street characters who were and putting them into a narrative movie, which is more what the Muppets were designed. Right. Writers probably like it when they get to do that stuff. Right. They definitely got to branch out cause they're not teaching letters and numbers. Now they're T they're doing a whole 70 minute story and follow that bird. Well, it's more of like, uh, you know, messages about family and friendship and responsibility and things like that. And that it's okay to jump from a moving truck. If a grownup gives you permission. That's right. That's important. Yes. Um, but, uh, then, you know, they had a second movie in the nineties called Elmo and Grouchland, which is not as good. It's much younger. Yeah. It's a much cheaper looking movie. I never saw that because I was, you know, it's not worth your time. It seemed like that one seemed more like what's cool about follow that bird is it's like big birds run amok on earth, you know, like big birds, like on a cross country voyage. That one's a little more in Muppet world, isn't it? Yes. Well, he goes to Grouchland. Yeah. Grouchland. It still makes follow that bird stand out as a little more unique. So Grouchland is like not educational. It's just like Elmo's adventure. No, there's, there's something educational about it. It's whatever it is. Like, yeah, it's well, it's like, I guess like learning to be brave. Well, there's definitely, it's been so long since I've seen the movie, but there's definitely moments when like the action stops and Elmo's like, well, we got to figure out how to do this. And like, it's just like, you got to some sort of logic or whatever that the kids are thinking, encouraged to like shout at the screen. Maybe I like a door to the Explorer thing, which is exactly what you want to hear in a movie theater. Yeah. Right. Like Elmo, if Elmo's not actively teaching me something, my tolerance for Elmo drops a lot. Like, I feel like Elmo gets away with a lot because he's educational. No, see, I think it's the opposite. I think Elmo is the most entertaining when he's just like allowed to go nuts. Elmo on talk shows is usually hilarious. It's hysterical. Now when he's, when he has to like teach, you know, the letter D, like maybe we're a little stuck with, with the educational content. Do you guys ever see the video? And I just remember when you said Elmo on a talk show. It used to be one of my favorite videos online. And I haven't thought about in a while with Cookie Monster on Martha Stewart show. Oh yeah. Cookie Monster's like, he seems like he's legitimately upsetting Martha Stewart. He is. Like what's the story there? The story is that Frank Oz is awesome. So first of all, pause, pause, go search Cookie Monster, Martha Stewart. You'll find it. All right, now they're back. What's up with that amazing video? Frank Oz does not give a fuck. That's what it comes down to. So that's Frank Oz. Cause like, I mean, that's a fairly recent video. Frank Oz still performs Muppets. Very rarely. He doesn't do the, the Muppet show characters anymore. He doesn't do Piggy, Fozzy, Animal, but he's every once in a while he shows up for Sesame Street stuff. From what I hear, it's like every other year he'll do like a day on, on set. Cool. I totally still does that. Yeah, I think he just does it. I mean like, a part of me is a little upset about the fact that like Frank Oz is genuinely one of the, if not one of the, he is the best puppeteer in the world. Like, I mean, he's just an amazing talent. Absolutely hysterical. But, oh, someone's ringing. he, um, just doesn't, Let's plow through it. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's cool. So, uh, yeah, so he's one of the best puppeteers in the world, but he, um, doesn't perform anymore. Like he just wants to direct and he's a good director. He's made some great movies. But he's not the greatest, greatest director in the world. That's true. That's like Picasso being like, you know, I'm going to try playing the guitar. Or Jordan playing baseball, I guess. Yeah, exactly. I see that, but at the same time, I think, you know, he's given us decades and decades of genius work. I think we can let him relax. But is he relaxing? I don't know. I don't know what genuinely, Frank Oz, what is Frank Oz doing right now? Well, he just got married. He didn't know. So that's Frank Oz on Martha Stewart. And he was just like, fuck it. And just like went for it. Yeah. Cause I think he also, like Frank Oz got to a point in his career where he's like, what are you gonna do? Fire me? Yeah, exactly. I'm fucking Cookie Monster. I'm Cookie Monster. Yeah. So Martha Stewart seems legitimately upset in that video. It's such a funny video. I think she wasn't expecting it. Yeah. There's also one of, um, Frank as Miss Piggy with Martha Stewart. That's almost as funny. Oh, well, the other one I was just going to mention is, uh, Miss Piggy on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno when they had her on for New Year's Eve. I don't remember what year it is. It's definitely on YouTube, but how old is it? Like 90? It's the 90. I want to say it's like 96 to 97, something like that. So they, so they have Miss Piggy on the top of some building in Times Square reporting live to, for the New Year's Eve thing. And you can kind of tell as they check in with Miss Piggy throughout the hour that Frank Oz is getting increasingly cranky. So we hear it was freezing cold. So they just wanted to, they're just waiting for midnight. So they can get the hell out of there. Yeah. By the end, he's just kind of like, he's screaming, he's yelling at people off camera. Who cares? There's a ball. It's going to drop. The ball is dropping. All right. So we're running out of time. One more, one last thing that we haven't talked about yet that people should see to really appreciate the genius of the Muppets from each of you. Let's get one more from each of you. Ryan, what are you thinking? I should be thinking about this while you're talking. Well, that's not fair. And go. Did I name an episode of the Muppet Show yet? No, I did. Yeah. Wow. I got to think about this. Well, here, while you're thinking, I got one. I'm going to brag for a second. Have you seen Big Birdman? No. It's a Birdman. I haven't seen Birdman yet. It's a Birdman spoof that I actually pitched a spoof of Birdman to the people of Sesame Street and got to write a script that eventually became a thing. That's incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. And it went viral. It went like crazy viral, like three quarters of a million views on YouTube. And the great thing about it was it's not just like we're spoofing a popular movie, but like we got to use Carol Spinney as himself. So Carol Spinney has been playing Big Bird for 40 some years. And it really was nice to, I mean, first of all, it's amazing to get to work with him, but like it's really great to see that Carol Spinney got a little bit of a spotlight as himself, not just as Big Bird. Well, there's that documentary out about him now too, right? Yes. I am Big Bird. Fantastic. That's about to open in theaters all over the country. Yeah. Beginning of March. So, I mean, but really the great thing about Big Birdman is more about, you know, what Sesame Street is doing nowadays, which is they're still doing like really amazing spoofs and they're still getting like crazy amounts of attention on YouTube and they're still like relevant, which is awesome. For a show that's 46 years old, you know, a puppet show for preschoolers, for people to care about it still, like still blows my mind. It's for preschoolers and people who watch YouTube. That's right. And for you and me. Yes, exactly. Mostly for you and me. That's right. I would recommend for Disney fans at least to watch the Muppets at Walt Disney World, which is a TV special that was one of the last things Jim Henson ever worked on. It was at the time when he was intending to sell the company to Disney in 1990. And they made this special, which is basically the Muppets running amok at Disney World. And it's just like they go to all three parks at the time. And it's all these, like pretty much every Muppet character gets something to do within the hour. And it's just really funny and fun and has great songs. It is. And tragically, not on DVD, which makes no sense. No, it's never been released. It's Disney. Disney owns the Muppets now. Yeah, it should be a DVD extra somewhere, but it hasn't been. Are you guys happy with how Disney has treated the Muppets now that they own them? Mostly. Except, you know, ignoring the fact they shut down the ride in the LA theme park. We won't let that slide just for this moment. You say mostly. I say mostly not. I feel like between, what was that, 2001 and 2011? 2004 was when they bought them. 2004. Yeah, it took them a while to make anything. Almost nothing. Like, that's awful. Wait, when did they buy them? 2004. And then, yeah, I mean, and then not really anything until the movie in 2011. Exactly. Yeah. So I feel like every once in a while, and still, like, we'll get like these, like a push of like, there's Muppets all over YouTube, or there's like a new Muppets special coming out, or a movie, or whatever. And then silence. Okay. We did that now. Let's take a few years off. And I'm also like upset about the fact that like, they've never figured out how to merchandise the Muppets since they've owned them. Like, how do we not have Muppets stuff? How hard is it to get like cool plush, more DVDs, anything? And they're really just kind of like, every once in a while, they're like, there's a little something, and we don't really want it.
