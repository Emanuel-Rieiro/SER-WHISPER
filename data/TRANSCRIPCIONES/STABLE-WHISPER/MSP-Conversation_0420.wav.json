{"text": " It is indeed Scores on the Doors then for your Wednesday night once again. And we're going to start, as ever, with the Scottish football. And, well, a fairly busy weekend, a bit of a mixed bag. It was Cup weekend in Scotland. We had the quarter-final stages. I'll run through the results with Dundee United 0, Celtic 4, Motherwell 1, Aberdeen 2, Hearts 2, St Mirren 2, Ayr 0, Hibs 2, those four games before others. You see there, Hearts and St Mirren, that one will go to a replay. Also in the SPL, one game to talk about, Inverness, Califisso 1, Kilmarnock 1 was the result in that one. So, fellas, I'll get you off and running for this evening. Your thoughts? Celtic getting through against Dundee United. 4-0 result, but you have to say the red card probably tainted that result, don't you think? I think so. Yep, tainted, definitely. I don't know if I'd use the word tainted, but it helped it. Definitely helped it, aye. You think? Because, I mean, the game was looking very tight. Dundee United were very much in the game. Celtic maybe never got started. But you sense that if Dundee United maybe kept all the men on the pitch, that it would be a tighter second half. I think they kept that world-beater, that star, Robbie Nilsson on it, would there be a difference? No, yeah. I think Dundee United are playing well into momentum, so they drained out when they got sent off, and Celtic just sort of took over a wee bit and started the passing game a wee bit and scored a penalty, a jacked penalty. I mean, Celtic, that's them through now. They either play Hearts or something. Can you see anyone stopping Celtic? Do you think anyone's got a chance of beating them? Well, I don't know. Dundee United done a good job until half-time, and then obviously when that Nilsson got sent off, so Celtic's run there isn't going to live forever. No run does. So someone has to stop them, and why not in the Cup? I think you're looking at Hearts, really. I think Hearts are probably one of the strongest teams in SPL right now, and we only beat them by Celtic, I mean. Only beat them by the skin of their teeth at Parkhead, the last time they played there. So I think Hearts have a big chance of taking the game. You say Hearts were unfortunate to get through at the weekend, but you say, Billy, that, I mean, obviously we know all about Rangers' problems. With Hearts' financial problems not getting paid off, do you think maybe the squad coming together has really helped them taking off the second half of the season? Well, yeah. I think when background trouble starts to creep in, you're looking at the team, the managers, the background staff to come together and try and... It's a really hard job for a manager to take the players' minds off it, especially when you're talking about wedgies, because that's what pays the bills at the end of the day. So they become real people when you start talking about that, so try to get them focused. The best thing you can do, especially in a team sport, is get them all together, and that's what they've got to look to do. I mean, on the pitch, I mean, obviously, as I say, the players have came together, but one player that really stood out the last couple of weeks for Hearts, Craig Beattie. He's been like a new player for Hearts. Revelation, man. Revelation. He's not been on the scene up here for a while, but we're buying for sure, and hopefully see more of that form. Quite exciting to see a striker, you know, on our team outside the big two. I suppose the cynic could say, well, he wasn't a very good Celtic. He's not had much luck recently, so his heart's just maybe his level. I don't know. He scored goals for Celtic, and that's what you want from a striker. So he does the job wherever he goes, and he's coming back up here, playing for a team outside the big two. It's going to make it more exciting, I think, my opinion. You know, it's always good to see a threat outside the real firm and make it a three-horse race. So do you think Levine might think, oh, maybe Scottish potential once again? I don't know. I don't know. Why not? I've always said this. If a player's playing well in the SPL and the Scottish, why not get a call-up? I suppose, although... Why not Jordan Rhodes, you know? I suppose in the SPL, you look at players like Beattie, that if they carry on playing well, although Hearts are not looking at your top three, but there's teams kicking about there. Obviously, Rangers have had their problems, but some other are trying to creep into second place, things like that. I mean, all these players would try to play well, and maybe Levine should take a chance on SPL players, shouldn't he? Well, you know... It does get happening. No. We're too harsh on Aiton. If a player gets a call-up, you don't get the chance to have a wee bit of a bad game, or he played all right, remember he's young, or he's not played that much. We're too harsh on Aiton, especially when it comes to football. You get your chance, you're expected to perform. That's the thing as well. We're no Brazil. All the fans seem to think, you know, less than five stars is not good enough. I mean, we'll talk about Scottish rugby later on, but in the football sense, whether it's club level or international level, you get a sort of case of, well... Pressure. All the pressure, the media and the fans, and I mean, really, we're just not good enough to be up against the sort of teams as that. We don't have to give that much pressure out in the first place. I think we should relax a wee bit, but it's a serious national sport, you know. We're not going to go lax on the players. It's hard to make the media an excuse, because it's not going to change. So, if you can't change it, then doesn't mean you want to continue to moan about it. You either go away or give up, you know. I think we'll find it hard to stop moaning about Scottish football or whatever. As long as we live. But also in the Scottish club at the weekend, Hibs, they've had a poor season all round. I mean, me and I know Kev and Andrew have been here. We've annihilated Hibs all season. They really have been an awful side to watch at times, but the cup run will be good for them, and they've got a chance for a final, haven't they? They've been unbelievable in the sense that they're on the bottom of the league. You know, it's that way you just can't believe that Dunfermline haven't gone over them yet. But you look at Dunfermline and realise there's a worse team than Hibs, unfortunately. But they've made a lot of signings, you know what I'm saying? They've made a lot of signings, but George Claros, that was a huge coup, you know, to get that under the nose of Rangers. You know, that's a huge deal for Hibs. He's a good player. I've looked at him a couple of times. I think he's probably the only bright spot for that team right now. You're looking at maybe, who's the young full-back we were talking about the other time? See, I say that I'm actually not a bit of an SPL. I honestly do not know anyone outside the old FIBA. I think a lot of fans, I think sometimes... Louis Stevenson, right? Now, he's a good player they've got, but I don't know. Pat Fairman said it. It's a tough job though. He's come in at a transitional period, you know. He's trying to build a team, a team that wasn't very good. He's trying to build it up. You think that, you have to say Hibs are lucky to have Dunfermline being weaker than them. Because, I mean, otherwise, I mean, Hibs out with the SPL. I know they were sort of taking a couple of seasons to get into the SPL originally when it started, but Hibs outside the SPL, no Enver Derby. I mean, that sounds unthinkable, doesn't it? Yeah, that's a sort of, it's a given, isn't it? To get the Enver Derby, but I don't know. It's certainly one that, we'll rumble on about Hibs' disastrous season in some sense in the league. Very quickly, we'll talk a lot about Rangers. They never had a game at the weekend, Rangers. But obviously, news developing over the weekend, obviously the players seen centrally in the end, some would say, taking the 75% pay cut for some of the top earnings. So, no real redundancies on the playing side at the moment. And we've also had Paul Murray, next director, and his Blue Knight consortium coming in. There was some rumoured interest for the Far Eastern USA. That's sort of died down. I mean, do you think, I mean, Scott Belly, and sort of people that follow Scottish Football Loaf a little bit more closely as well, that things, I mean, last week, we were on this show talking about, this is bad, but I mean, there's a glimmer of hope, don't you think, maybe behind the scenes? Well, yeah, I think there is. Well, the players have taken their cut, and the administrators are there saying, if you take this cut, no one has to lose their job, we don't have to liquidate, then there's always going to be a wee bit of hope. I'm hoping, anyway. Taking side, what side, the field, Scotland. Do you think, quite a sort of revealing statement yesterday from David Murray saying, sorry, he was duped by Craig White. Do you feel sorry for David Murray at all? No, no, because he promised us, when he was giving the club over, he'd give it to, he'd put it in the safest hands possible. Am I right in saying that? Yeah. I don't feel sorry for anyone that worked behind the scenes, because, and it's not just Rangers, every club, they don't get told absolutely everything. I mean, I think they're quite happy. As long as teams are successful, like Rangers are, or they're going to be, the same as Celtic, it's only, it's them that are going to win the league, so the success will hide the cracks. So, if people are dipping money here, dipping money there, the success means that the fans won't ask any questions, and I probably find that a lot of the people behind the scenes won't be allowed to know, anyway, apart from the wee board, who's all winning, anyway. I think it's as well, you know, it's people's, forget about all the caterers and cleaners, it's their jobs as well, you know. It's a lot of people that aren't attached to playing football, necessarily, you know, it's a big deal, man, so, hopefully it gets sorted out. It's certainly something that you've... It's got to lie, a wee bit of blame with David Murray, I think, he's just walked away from a bad situation, I think, and took now the flag for it, you know. It's certainly something that both sides, the argument there, I mean, it's something that we'll continue to discuss, I'm sure, most weeks, at Scores on the Doors. If you've got any thoughts on that, do get in touch, at City underscore Radio on Twitter, or Facebook.com, for us, at Scores on the Doors. Before we move away from Scottish football, the first trophy of the weekend, League Cup final, Celtic against Comaric, you were on about earlier, Scott, the runs all have to come to an end, unbeaten runs, is there any prayer at all for Comaric? Yeah. See, I don't like saying it against Comaric, and all the other teams that aren't within the top two, because they are good teams, they're just not as good as the top two. You think if some of the teams like Motherwell, Comaric, and that had just a little bit more dosh, I mean, maybe... Absolutely, right. Certainly, I mean, you always say take the Celtic range out of it, and we have said before, well, it could be disastrous, but, I mean, the other teams, I mean, there are some decent players kicking them out, I mean, they always get overshadowed, certainly, by the old firm. Well, where did Stephen Naismith come from? He came from Comaric, didn't he? Chris Boyd. Chris Boyd, Liam McCulloch, am I right in saying McCulloch? He's been in, been quite a few players in Celtic, like, sometimes go through that avenue. We went to Hibs for a couple of players, I think Scott Brown. Whittaker for Hibs. I think for Hibs as well. I mean, to give you the team Hibs had at one point, you know, you've got... Hibs had a decent team a few years ago. You've got, well, it's in the same team you get Brown, Whittaker, Kevin Thompson, Ian Murray, I think, as well, who's still captain at Hibs. You know, Hearts have a really good side right now, and that, I mean, they're not talking really good for SPL standards, they're not talking Barcelona, beat us here, but, you know, for the SPL standards, our team's quite strong. Towel, Beatty up front, you know. Still got Kevin Kyle as well, he's a big, big fella, you know, so. It's just unbelievable there are no second place, no challenging of a second, you know. Strong teams, challenging of a third, second place, you know. We've talked before about Comaric, obviously, there in the cut file. They've, I mean, they play good football. Okay, they drew at Inverness again, they've had a few bad results. They drew three against Celtic early in the season, and that was really well in that game. They play well, and they've got a philosophy there that, okay, we might lose a few games, but we'll play well. I mean, I quite admire that. Celtic will win the cup, because it's the first cup of the season. I think if there's going to be an upset, it'll be in the Scottish Cup. But, there's only hope for Comaric, because I've played in finals against teams that were better than us, and came away with a good result. I've played in cup finals where we've played a team we thought were lesser than ourselves, and came away greeting, shall we say, because we've lost. So, the cup final always adds that bit of chance, but I think first cup final of the season, they'll win it. Like, give us all a quick score prediction. 3-0. Oh, sorry, I was 2. Is that 3-1 now? 2-Celtic. 3-1 to Celtic. I'm going to be fair about it. Billy? I think it'll be 2-1 to Comaric. Scott? I'm going to say it's going to be one each, then put the penalties. Okay, we'll wait and see. I think Celtic will win it 3-1 myself. I had that in my head, 3-1. We'll wait and see. That's the Scottish football. We'll move away from Scotland. We'll go down south to England. Big stories from the weekend. Well, the main story, we'll have to start with Manchester City losing out to Swansea City. 1-0, and they're off the top spot of the table. We'll have more of a discussion on that in a moment, but let's hear from the two managers from the match, Roberto Mancini and Brendan Rodgers. We're going to have a good football, but after the second half we had the control of the game, we're missing three or four chances in counter-attack to score. This is the problem in this moment. And after we concede a stupid goal, a team like us can't concede a goal like this. We are sure that we should fight against them until the end. We have another 10 games to finish this championship. The season is long. Every week can change the situation. Now it's important that we are very compact together because it doesn't change anything. It's better to stay on the top, but now we are behind. But this doesn't change our target. When you perform that well, sometimes you get results, don't you? You take on the big guns of European football. We're hanging on. But we were the better side today. We were the better side. Obviously there's moments, as you'd expect, in the second half, in particular when we scored. I think that was the period when we showed our maturity, tactically. How we dropped in our lines and blocked spaces. It was very, very difficult for them to get through us. I think over the course of the game, some of our passing and moving and ball retention today against top players was phenomenal. We got one goal. We missed a penalty. We could have had one or two more. I think the players deserve every credit that they get for the technical and tactical ability of their game today, as well as that mentality to want to take on a top team. Liverpool 0-0. Chelsea 1-0. Stoke 0-0. Aston Villa 1-0. Fulham 0-0. Bolton 2-0. QPR 1-0. On Sunday, we had Norwich 1-0. Wigan 1-0. Swansea 1-0. City 0-0, as we have heard. United 2-0. West Brom 0-0. Monday night was Arsenal 2-0. Newcastle 1-0. And then a sort of rearranged game from last night. It was Liverpool 3-0. Everton 0-0. And the Merseyside derby. So, the big game of the weekend, obviously, from Swansea. Swansea beating Man City. And you have to say, Sir Alex Ferguson, a man who comes into the zone, on the last third of the season, he'll be sitting pretty now. At the top, he'll be delighted with that, surely? Well, it sounds like I repeat myself all the time. He's been there, seen it, and done it. Most of the players understand how to win the Man United. I think that there was cheers from the crowd when they scored. The champions. So, they obviously think that that's them. United, I was looking, we were looking earlier, Jamie, at the run. United got slightly better run than that. Three or four games. Oh, yeah, definitely. And the sense that if Man City was to not win the title this year, his job would be gone. I don't believe it. Man City won't be there if he doesn't win the league. I don't know. I disagree. I think he might have a job. I really think he might. If you justify that. Go on then, Jamie. Justify that. He's led Man United. You know, he's done with no other Man City manager. I could do with him recently. So, if they lose the league, he's done with every other Man City manager. He's put on some good football. He's put on some good football. He spent far too much money not to win the league. Beat Man United 6-0, 6-1, didn't he? It means nothing. It's a great result. The fans won't want him to go. The fans like him. I would go easily. Rangers losing four old firm games a season and win the league. Wouldn't have a problem with it. He spent so much money and you don't win the league. I mean, look at Stuart Pearce, Kevin Keegan. They've not had unlimited millions to spend, have they? I mean, they were sort of stumbling along with table, man. It's a different league, though. England can afford to throw that away. It's not the SPL. Look at the SPL standards. You look at England taking for that money away. He's a fan favourite. I'm telling you. He'll get another chance. He's a fan favourite because... I'm actually... I'm going to say what I said earlier. I think Man City will come back anyway. They've got a tough run, but I think Man United will... Although they have the easier games coming up, it appears to be the easier games. Blackburn and that. It just could be bogeys. I don't know, man. I think Man City might come back, innit? Scott, would you like to enter this debate? No, I'm scared. It's getting awful heated in here. The eight-man chain will go at the end of the season if he doesn't win the title. Well, aye. I'm not just siding with Billy here, but the money he's spent, it's disgusting. I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's right. I'm just saying that he will get sacked. That's a totally different moral issue that the money he's spent. Because the owners won't accept it. And then the moral issue, every staff, they spend that amount of money. I can see the point about success, right? But see, I think the money, I think he'll be fine there, but I think the fans have taken to him. I don't know. I think he's done a good job. They've taken to him. They've hit that wee slump in the season where you see the fans start to turn because they realise that they're losing grasp of the league when they thought it was finished. Do you know, I think part of the Man United fans just shan't champion him. You're just being a bit too confident. They've done it all before, as you say. I mean, they know. The fans know as well as the players. I was going to ask a question about Man City. I mean, a part of the money they've spent, they've got brilliant world-class players in there, like Zaguero or whatever. But I know you've got De Jong in there. But I mean, when you look at the names that you can rattle off for Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, like Robben, and all that, Man City, doesn't it fill you with names that are like wow factor, do they? It's overpriced players. And I think that's a recurring thing in the Premiership, isn't it? Overpriced players. You've got Torres, Carroll. Oh, God. Torres, man, that is another story, another time, man. He's terrible. Well, you used to be amazing. It's just disgusting how much money is spent on average players. If you look at... What was it? Andy Carroll's 53 million? Just for Andy Carroll, was it? 50-odd million? Aye. Suarez. And if you look at them, Man City squad, you've got like Gareth Barry, James Milner. Average players that are collecting a healthy package. Padding out these sort of big names, like maybe... Balotelli wasn't a huge name before he came to Man City, anyway, was he really? He was just a sort of third striker for Inter, really. Balotelli has his days. When he's playing well, he's the one you want in your team. But then, as a manager, I don't think Man City's strong enough. I would not. Except the amount of his discipline. And I just think he's a weak manager for that. Interesting points. Have you got any argument at all with that? At City underscore you on Twitter or on Facebook. Facebook.com forward slash scores. We've got a tweet in from Lee Smithers saying, Where's Kevin Andrew, the A-team, gone with? We missed the start of the show. Kevin Andrew's not with us this week. Andrew is feeling a bit poorly this week. And Kevin, one of the two matters that he can't be here in college and in Glasgow this week. So, he should be back next week.

your Wednesday night once again. And we're going to start, as ever, with the Scottish football. And, well, a fairly busy weekend, a bit of a mixed bag. It was Cup weekend in Scotland. We had the quarter-final stages. I'll run through the results with Dundee United 0, Celtic 4, Motherwell 1, Aberdeen 2, Hearts 2, St Mirren 2, Ayr 0, Hibs 2, those four games before others. You see there, Hearts and St Mirren, that one will go to a replay. Also in the SPL, one game to talk about, Inverness, Califisso 1, Kilmarnock 1 was the result in that one. So, fellas, I'll get you off and running for this evening. Your thoughts? Celtic getting through against Dundee United. 4-0 result, but you have to say the red card probably tainted that result, don't you think? I think so. Yep, tainted, definitely. I don't know if I'd use the word tainted, but it helped it. Definitely helped it, aye. You think? Because, I mean, the game was looking very tight. Dundee United were very much in the game. Celtic maybe never got started. But you sense that if Dundee United maybe kept all the men on the pitch, that it would be a tighter second half. I think they kept that world-beater, that star, Robbie Nilsson on it, would there be a difference? No, yeah. I think Dundee United are playing well into momentum, so they drained out when they got sent off, and Celtic just sort of took over a wee bit and started the passing game a wee bit and scored a penalty, a jacked penalty. I mean, Celtic, that's them through now. They either play Hearts or something. Can you see anyone stopping Celtic? Do you think anyone's got a chance of beating them? Well, I don't know. Dundee United done a good job until half-time, and then obviously when that Nilsson got sent off, so Celtic's run there isn't going to live forever. No run does. So someone has to stop them, and why not in the Cup? I think you're looking at Hearts, really. I think Hearts are probably one of the strongest teams in SPL right now, and we only beat them by Celtic, I mean. Only beat them by the skin of their teeth at Parkhead, the last time they played there. So I think Hearts have a big chance of taking the game. You say Hearts were unfortunate to get through at the weekend, but you say, Billy, that, I mean, obviously we know all about Rangers' problems. With Hearts' financial problems not getting paid off, do you think maybe the squad coming together has really helped them taking off the second half of the season? Well, yeah. I think when background trouble starts to creep in, you're looking at the team, the managers, the background staff to come together and try and... It's a really hard job for a manager to take the players' minds off it, especially when you're talking about wedgies, because that's what pays the bills at the end of the day. So they become real people when you start talking about that, so try to get them focused. The best thing you can do, especially in a team sport, is get them all together, and that's what they've got to look to do. I mean, on the pitch, I mean, obviously, as I say, the players have came together, but one player that really stood out the last couple of weeks for Hearts, Craig Beattie. He's been like a new player for Hearts. Revelation, man. Revelation. He's not been on the scene up here for a while, but we're buying for sure, and hopefully see more of that form. Quite exciting to see a striker, you know, on our team outside the big two. I suppose the cynic could say, well, he wasn't a very good Celtic. He's not had much luck recently, so his heart's just maybe his level. I don't know. He scored goals for Celtic, and that's what you want from a striker. So he does the job wherever he goes, and he's coming back up here, playing for a team outside the big two. It's going to make it more exciting, I think, my opinion. You know, it's always good to see a threat outside the real firm and make it a three-horse race. So do you think Levine might think, oh, maybe Scottish potential once again? I don't know. I don't know. Why not? I've always said this. If a player's playing well in the SPL and the Scottish, why not get a call-up? I suppose, although... Why not Jordan Rhodes, you know? I suppose in the SPL, you look at players like Beattie, that if they carry on playing well, although Hearts are not looking at your top three, but there's teams kicking about there. Obviously, Rangers have had their problems, but some other are trying to creep into second place, things like that. I mean, all these players would try to play well, and maybe Levine should take a chance on SPL players, shouldn't he? Well, you know... It does get happening. No. We're too harsh on Aiton. If a player gets a call-up, you don't get the chance to have a wee bit of a bad game, or he played all right, remember he's young, or he's not played that much. We're too harsh on Aiton, especially when it comes to football. You get your chance, you're expected to perform. That's the thing as well. We're no Brazil. All the fans seem to think, you know, less than five stars is not good enough. I mean, we'll talk about Scottish rugby later on, but in the football sense, whether it's club level or international level, you get a sort of case of, well... Pressure. All the pressure, the media and the fans, and I mean, really, we're just not good enough to be up against the sort of teams as that. We don't have to give that much pressure out in the first place. I think we should relax a wee bit, but it's a serious national sport, you know. We're not going to go lax on the players. It's hard to make the media an excuse, because it's not going to change. So, if you can't change it, then doesn't mean you want to continue to moan about it. You either go away or give up, you know. I think we'll find it hard to stop moaning about Scottish football or whatever. As long as we live. But also in the Scottish club at the weekend, Hibs, they've had a poor season all round. I mean, me and I know Kev and Andrew have been here. We've annihilated Hibs all season. They really have been an awful side to watch at times, but the cup run will be good for them, and they've got a chance for a final, haven't they? They've been unbelievable in the sense that they're on the bottom of the league. You know, it's that way you just can't believe that Dunfermline haven't gone over them yet. But you look at Dunfermline and realise there's a worse team than Hibs, unfortunately. But they've made a lot of signings, you know what I'm saying? They've made a lot of signings, but George Claros, that was a huge coup, you know, to get that under the nose of Rangers. You know, that's a huge deal for Hibs. He's a good player. I've looked at him a couple of times. I think he's probably the only bright spot for that team right now. You're looking at maybe, who's the young full-back we were talking about the other time? See, I say that I'm actually not a bit of an SPL. I honestly do not know anyone outside the old FIBA. I think a lot of fans, I think sometimes... Louis Stevenson, right? Now, he's a good player they've got, but I don't know. Pat Fairman said it. It's a tough job though. He's come in at a transitional period, you know. He's trying to build a team, a team that wasn't very good. He's trying to build it up. You think that, you have to say Hibs are lucky to have Dunfermline being weaker than them. Because, I mean, otherwise, I mean, Hibs out with the SPL. I know they were sort of taking a couple of seasons to get into the SPL originally when it started, but Hibs outside the SPL, no Enver Derby. I mean, that sounds unthinkable, doesn't it? Yeah, that's a sort of, it's a given, isn't it? To get the Enver Derby, but I don't know. It's certainly one that, we'll rumble on about Hibs' disastrous season in some sense in the league. Very quickly, we'll talk a lot about Rangers. They never had a game at the weekend, Rangers. But obviously, news developing over the weekend, obviously the players seen centrally in the end, some would say, taking the 75% pay cut for some of the top earnings. So, no real redundancies on the playing side at the moment. And we've also had Paul Murray, next director, and his Blue Knight consortium coming in. There was some rumoured interest for the Far Eastern USA. That's sort of died down. I mean, do you think, I mean, Scott Belly, and sort of people that follow Scottish Football Loaf a little bit more closely as well, that things, I mean, last week, we were on this show talking about, this is bad, but I mean, there's a glimmer of hope, don't you think, maybe behind the scenes? Well, yeah, I think there is. Well, the players have taken their cut, and the administrators are there saying, if you take this cut, no one has to lose their job, we don't have to liquidate, then there's always going to be a wee bit of hope. I'm hoping, anyway. Taking side, what side, the field, Scotland. Do you think, quite a sort of revealing statement yesterday from David Murray saying, sorry, he was duped by Craig White. Do you feel sorry for David Murray at all? No, no, because he promised us, when he was giving the club over, he'd give it to, he'd put it in the safest hands possible. Am I right in saying that? Yeah. I don't feel sorry for anyone that worked behind the scenes, because, and it's not just Rangers, every club, they don't get told absolutely everything. I mean, I think they're quite happy. As long as teams are successful, like Rangers are, or they're going to be, the same as Celtic, it's only, it's them that are going to win the league, so the success will hide the cracks. So, if people are dipping money here, dipping money there, the success means that the fans won't ask any questions, and I probably find that a lot of the people behind the scenes won't be allowed to know, anyway, apart from the wee board, who's all winning, anyway. I think it's as well, you know, it's people's, forget about all the caterers and cleaners, it's their jobs as well, you know. It's a lot of people that aren't attached to playing football, necessarily, you know, it's a big deal, man, so, hopefully it gets sorted out. It's certainly something that you've... It's got to lie, a wee bit of blame with David Murray, I think, he's just walked away from a bad situation, I think, and took now the flag for it, you know. It's certainly something that both sides, the argument there, I mean, it's something that we'll continue to discuss, I'm sure, most weeks, at Scores on the Doors. If you've got any thoughts on that, do get in touch, at City underscore Radio on Twitter, or Facebook.com, for us, at Scores on the Doors. Before we move away from Scottish football, the first trophy of the weekend, League Cup final, Celtic against Comaric, you were on about earlier, Scott, the runs all have to come to an end, unbeaten runs, is there any prayer at all for Comaric? Yeah. See, I don't like saying it against Comaric, and all the other teams that aren't within the top two, because they are good teams, they're just not as good as the top two. You think if some of the teams like Motherwell, Comaric, and that had just a little bit more dosh, I mean, maybe... Absolutely, right. Certainly, I mean, you always say take the Celtic range out of it, and we have said before, well, it could be disastrous, but, I mean, the other teams, I mean, there are some decent players kicking them out, I mean, they always get overshadowed, certainly, by the old firm. Well, where did Stephen Naismith come from? He came from Comaric, didn't he? Chris Boyd. Chris Boyd, Liam McCulloch, am I right in saying McCulloch? He's been in, been quite a few players in Celtic, like, sometimes go through that avenue. We went to Hibs for a couple of players, I think Scott Brown. Whittaker for Hibs. I think for Hibs as well. I mean, to give you the team Hibs had at one point, you know, you've got... Hibs had a decent team a few years ago. You've got, well, it's in the same team you get Brown, Whittaker, Kevin Thompson, Ian Murray, I think, as well, who's still captain at Hibs. You know, Hearts have a really good side right now, and that, I mean, they're not talking really good for SPL standards, they're not talking Barcelona, beat us here, but, you know, for the SPL standards, our team's quite strong. Towel, Beatty up front, you know. Still got Kevin Kyle as well, he's a big, big fella, you know, so. It's just unbelievable there are no second place, no challenging of a second, you know. Strong teams, challenging of a third, second place, you know. We've talked before about Comaric, obviously, there in the cut file. They've, I mean, they play good football. Okay, they drew at Inverness again, they've had a few bad results. They drew three against Celtic early in the season, and that was really well in that game. They play well, and they've got a philosophy there that, okay, we might lose a few games, but we'll play well. I mean, I quite admire that. Celtic will win the cup, because it's the first cup of the season. I think if there's going to be an upset, it'll be in the Scottish Cup. But, there's only hope for Comaric, because I've played in finals against teams that were better than us, and came away with a good result. I've played in cup finals where we've played a team we thought were lesser than ourselves, and came away greeting, shall we say, because we've lost. So, the cup final always adds that bit of chance, but I think first cup final of the season, they'll win it. Like, give us all a quick score prediction. 3-0. Oh, sorry, I was 2. Is that 3-1 now? 2-Celtic. 3-1 to Celtic. I'm going to be fair about it. Billy? I think it'll be 2-1 to Comaric. Scott? I'm going to say it's going to be one each, then put the penalties. Okay, we'll wait and see. I think Celtic will win it 3-1 myself. I had that in my head, 3-1. We'll wait and see. That's the Scottish football. We'll move away from Scotland. We'll go down south to England. Big stories from the weekend. Well, the main story, we'll have to start with Manchester City losing out to Swansea City. 1-0, and they're off the top spot of the table. We'll have more of a discussion on that in a moment, but let's hear from the two managers from the match, Roberto Mancini and Brendan Rodgers. We're going to have a good football, but after the second half we had the control of the game, we're missing three or four chances in counter-attack to score. This is the problem in this moment. And after we concede a stupid goal, a team like us can't concede a goal like this. We are sure that we should fight against them until the end. We have another 10 games to finish this championship. The season is long. Every week can change the situation. Now it's important that we are very compact together because it doesn't change anything. It's better to stay on the top, but now we are behind. But this doesn't change our target. When you perform that well, sometimes you get results, don't you? You take on the big guns of European football. We're hanging on. But we were the better side today. We were the better side. Obviously there's moments, as you'd expect, in the second half, in particular when we scored. I think that was the period when we showed our maturity, tactically. How we dropped in our lines and blocked spaces. It was very, very difficult for them to get through us. I think over the course of the game, some of our passing and moving and ball retention today against top players was phenomenal. We got one goal. We missed a penalty. We could have had one or two more. I think the players deserve every credit that they get for the technical and tactical ability of their game today, as well as that mentality to want to take on a top team. Liverpool 0-0. Chelsea 1-0. Stoke 0-0. Aston Villa 1-0. Fulham 0-0. Bolton 2-0. QPR 1-0. On Sunday, we had Norwich 1-0. Wigan 1-0. Swansea 1-0. City 0-0, as we have heard. United 2-0. West Brom 0-0. Monday night was Arsenal 2-0. Newcastle 1-0. And then a sort of rearranged game from last night. It was Liverpool 3-0. Everton 0-0. And the Merseyside derby. So, the big game of the weekend, obviously, from Swansea. Swansea beating Man City. And you have to say, Sir Alex Ferguson, a man who comes into the zone, on the last third of the season, he'll be sitting pretty now. At the top, he'll be delighted with that, surely? Well, it sounds like I repeat myself all the time. He's been there, seen it, and done it. Most of the players understand how to win the Man United. I think that there was cheers from the crowd when they scored. The champions. So, they obviously think that that's them. United, I was looking, we were looking earlier, Jamie, at the run. United got slightly better run than that. Three or four games. Oh, yeah, definitely. And the sense that if Man City was to not win the title this year, his job would be gone. I don't believe it. Man City won't be there if he doesn't win the league. I don't know. I disagree. I think he might have a job. I really think he might. If you justify that. Go on then, Jamie. Justify that. He's led Man United. You know, he's done with no other Man City manager. I could do with him recently. So, if they lose the league, he's done with every other Man City manager. He's put on some good football. He's put on some good football. He spent far too much money not to win the league. Beat Man United 6-0, 6-1, didn't he? It means nothing. It's a great result. The fans won't want him to go. The fans like him. I would go easily. Rangers losing four old firm games a season and win the league. Wouldn't have a problem with it. He spent so much money and you don't win the league. I mean, look at Stuart Pearce, Kevin Keegan. They've not had unlimited millions to spend, have they? I mean, they were sort of stumbling along with table, man. It's a different league, though. England can afford to throw that away. It's not the SPL. Look at the SPL standards. You look at England taking for that money away. He's a fan favourite. I'm telling you. He'll get another chance. He's a fan favourite because... I'm actually... I'm going to say what I said earlier. I think Man City will come back anyway. They've got a tough run, but I think Man United will... Although they have the easier games coming up, it appears to be the easier games. Blackburn and that. It just could be bogeys. I don't know, man. I think Man City might come back, innit? Scott, would you like to enter this debate? No, I'm scared. It's getting awful heated in here. The eight-man chain will go at the end of the season if he doesn't win the title. Well, aye. I'm not just siding with Billy here, but the money he's spent, it's disgusting. I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's right. I'm just saying that he will get sacked. That's a totally different moral issue that the money he's spent. Because the owners won't accept it. And then the moral issue, every staff, they spend that amount of money. I can see the point about success, right? But see, I think the money, I think he'll be fine there, but I think the fans have taken to him. I don't know. I think he's done a good job. They've taken to him. They've hit that wee slump in the season where you see the fans start to turn because they realise that they're losing grasp of the league when they thought it was finished. Do you know, I think part of the Man United fans just shan't champion him. You're just being a bit too confident. They've done it all before, as you say. I mean, they know. The fans know as well as the players. I was going to ask a question about Man City. I mean, a part of the money they've spent, they've got brilliant world-class players in there, like Zaguero or whatever. But I know you've got De Jong in there. But I mean, when you look at the names that you can rattle off for Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, like Robben, and all that, Man City, doesn't it fill you with names that are like wow factor, do they? It's overpriced players. And I think that's a recurring thing in the Premiership, isn't it? Overpriced players. You've got Torres, Carroll. Oh, God. Torres, man, that is another story, another time, man. He's terrible. Well, you used to be amazing. It's just disgusting how much money is spent on average players. If you look at... What was it? Andy Carroll's 53 million? Just for Andy Carroll, was it? 50-odd million? Aye. Suarez. And if you look at them, Man City squad, you've got like Gareth Barry, James Milner. Average players that are collecting a healthy package. Padding out these sort of big names, like maybe... Balotelli wasn't a huge name before he came to Man City, anyway, was he really? He was just a sort of third striker for Inter, really. Balotelli has his days. When he's playing well, he's the one you want in your team. But then, as a manager, I don't think Man City's strong enough. I would not. Except the amount of his discipline. And I just think he's a weak manager for that. Interesting points. Have you got any argument at all with that? At City underscore you on Twitter or on Facebook. Facebook.com forward slash scores. We've got a tweet in from Lee Smithers saying, Where's Kevin Andrew, the A-team, gone with? We missed the start of the show. Kevin Andrew's not with us this week. Andrew is feeling a bit poorly this week. And Kevin, one of the two matters that he can't be here in college and in Glasgow this week. So, he should be back next week.

So he does the job wherever he goes, and he's coming back up here, playing for a team outside the big two. It's going to make it more exciting, I think, my opinion.
