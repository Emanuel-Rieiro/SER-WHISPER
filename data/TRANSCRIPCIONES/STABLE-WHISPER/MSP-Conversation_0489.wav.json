{"text": " Have you thought about also flipping it? I was just thinking about this installation called Riverbed that was put into a museum in Denmark that is literally a river built inside the white pristine wall. Now I'll send you a link, Andrew, you can put it in the podcast. Okay, please do. With the white pristine walls of a museum, but the floor is a riverbed and you're walking on a river. Could we install vacants in a room in the BMA so that it would give you this? Please don't. But perspective shifts, right? When you look at something, not in honor of the vacant, but just to give it a different perspective. And I'm sure there's lots of people who go to the BMA that don't go to other parts of Baltimore where vacants are pervasive. I would say probably the vast majority of the people who go to the BMA. So actually this then becomes interesting. Because one of the things that we're really interested in at the moment is how we find out what our various communities want from us as a museum. You know, we're really interested at, you know, it is the museum's 100th birthday. We are going through this big redevelopment and reopening of big sections of the museum, like the American Wing. One of the things that becomes really interesting for us is actually how we do find out what our many different communities and the communities of Baltimore. And in fact, Maryland, what is important to them and what we can be doing for them. So this is one of the reasons we're actually having so many more social media efforts is trying to give people ways of connecting back to us. So those kinds of ideas of, you know, if there's something that people really want of the museum, if they come and tell us, then we have that opportunity to start working with those ideas as well. I think that's very much interested in trying to find out the different communities and working out how we actually can respond to them and be for them. And so things like Katie's Outposts, going out into the neighborhoods, but also actually starting up with our social media efforts. We're trying to really start asking people what they want a lot more so we can respond. I think that's very much where we're going as an institution. I think there's a lot of time about the great disruptive network effect of the internet, but it's always great to see these tools put to use for things other than, you know, photo sharing of meals at expensive restaurants or finding... I do that too, you know. You know, it's not all about the vacants and public policy. I mean, yeah, there's a... I posted a photo this morning on my Facebook of my cat who had decided to climb into the dryer, and I thought that was damn funny. Well, cats are what the internet are built for. Thank you. Quite honestly, I saw Tim Berners-Lee in your talk about two years ago, and he was saying, you know, one of the very first things that we were trying to do was send a photo from one colleague's computer to another, and it was a photo of his cat. So actually, the internet is built for cats. I knew it. I knew it. I was making suspicion, but yeah. I didn't realize that, that the first internet pic was... Was trying to send a picture of a cat. There is a reason that our feline overlords are, you know, dominating so much on the internet. There you go. Aside with the canine resistance, but... You don't have any pets, Andrew. No, I grew up with dogs. I'm a dog person, born and bred. Well, I mean, we have gone on quite a while, but it's been fascinating, and... I'm sure we could go on quite a while longer, actually. Oh, yeah, we totally... But then that would involve cocktails. That's what... Maybe there should be an All the Pieces Matter PM version. There you go. This is primarily a caffeinated edition of our show, so we'll see. I think, Sharon, that's going to be your responsibility. Caffeine or cocktails? The cocktail part. Oh, cocktails with caffeine in them. There's always that possibility. It's Red Bull, so it will have to be something else. No, it's not so Montaigne's. Well, I think that we've got to put that in the hopper for development. But in the meantime... Put that in the suggestion box. Yeah. I'm happy to play bartender. I'll send you an anonymous email. Just pretend you don't see my name next time. And this conversation never happened. Yeah. Exactly. Nobody will know. This will be edited out. So are there things that any of you guys would like to plug, or mention, things that are coming up, things that people might want to be on the lookout for? Oh, I'm having a fundraiser and silent art auction on October the 24th at Gallery 788 on Hickory Avenue in Hampton. And it's from 7 to 11 p.m. So a lot of the artists who painted the murals around the city last summer are contributing pieces of their work. And then people can come and bid on them and have drinks and food and bid. And so all the proceeds will go towards Housing Policy Watch. Brilliant. Yeah, I'm really excited. It's going to be a big party because the gallery director, Eduardo, knows how to throw one hell of a party. So I'm excited. Yay, party! And yay, fundraising! Yeah, I have to say, so the BMA is having its own fundraising party as well in November, which is known as our Party of the Century. And it's actually raising funds for, well, it's to celebrate the 100-year anniversary, but it's actually raising funds for our new-to-come Centre for Learning and Creativity. So actually, again, in terms of talking about ways for community to engage, we're creating a space in the museum specifically for that purpose. On our website, which is artbma.org, that's probably the best place to get all of the details for that event. But also for the 100-year celebration, it's kicking off pretty soon. We're having 100 days of celebration in response to the 100 years. And it's going to be, I think, a very busy and very enjoyable time in the museum. But no art auctions? You could take a page from Carol and I can buy Rodin's Thinker from you or something. Nobody's allowed to auction off the museum's pieces. No, it's unlikely that we could do that. She might get a little, you know, she might get in a little trouble. A little bit. Yeah, we might have to raise bad money. I was just kidding. No, I don't think Sharon is. I think she really wants you to heist her. I don't know where I put it. This is what scanners and 3D printers are for, right? Oh, that's been done also. Well, yeah, we have a scan of Rodin's Thinker. We scanned it recently over the summer. We're getting all of the data into a packageable format to get it online. But then you will be able to. I will be able to have my own little version. In bright yellow plastic. Exactly. Hot pink. Just as Rodin originally imagined it would be. Oh, I love that idea. That's so cool. Yeah. He's settled for bronze. And I want to put in a plug for Hack Baltimore's event coming up September 30th at Humanum. At 6 p.m. called Urban Fight, where we'll be taking a look at work that's being done all over the city by all different kinds of people and institutions to combat vacancy, urban blight in Baltimore. And it's a start of a conversation that we hope will continue past that event. But if you're interested in this subject, I mean, we really urge you to come out and join us for that evening. It should be. Should be interesting, if nothing else. Yeah. And it's in this talking about architecture and space and blight in Baltimore. It's in the old American brewery building on Gay Street. And is it in Oliver? Or it's near Oliver, that neighborhood? But it is a magnificent building that's been beautifully restored by Humanum, which is a nonprofit and social enterprise. It's a great place to meet and to kind of take in all the good and bad of the city. Yeah. It's this gorgeous, I don't even know, Beaux-Arts building that's sitting in, I don't know if it's Beaux-Arts. No, it's Mansard style, I think. Yeah. It's got that weird Mansard. But sitting in this, I mean, but sitting in a sea of neglect and vacancy. It's a wasteland. Basically, it sits in the middle of a wasteland. It sits in nothing. It's kind of like one of those still standing houses, though. It's like, well, we are a big institution and we're going to say, you know, this place is worth having a beautifully restored historic building. And they're a great organization, too. They're very involved in the community. They didn't just come and redo this grand building and then lock the doors and windows. Right. They do a lot in the community and the people who work in the building are neighbors. Of the building. And I really like Humanum. Yeah. I mean, as Hack Baltimore, we chose it very intentionally because it's such a great example of what could be with like thoughtfulness and appropriate investment. Yeah. It's just a beacon of what could happen with vacancy in the city.

"ori_dict": {"text": " Have you thought about also flipping it? I was just thinking about this installation called Riverbed that was put into a museum in Denmark that is literally a river built inside the white pristine wall. Now I'll send you a link, Andrew, you can put it in the podcast. Okay, please do. With the white pristine walls of a museum, but the floor is a riverbed and you're walking on a river. Could we install vacants in a room in the BMA so that it would give you this? Please don't. But perspective shifts, right? When you look at something, not in honor of the vacant, but just to give it a different perspective. And I'm sure there's lots of people who go to the BMA that don't go to other parts of Baltimore where vacants are pervasive. I would say probably the vast majority of the people who go to the BMA. So actually this then becomes interesting. Because one of the things that we're really interested in at the moment is how we find out what our various communities want from us as a museum. You know, we're really interested at, you know, it is the museum's 100th birthday. We are going through this big redevelopment and reopening of big sections of the museum, like the American Wing. One of the things that becomes really interesting for us is actually how we do find out what our many different communities and the communities of Baltimore. And in fact, Maryland, what is important to them and what we can be doing for them. So this is one of the reasons we're actually having so many more social media efforts is trying to give people ways of connecting back to us. So those kinds of ideas of, you know, if there's something that people really want of the museum, if they come and tell us, then we have that opportunity to start working with those ideas as well. I think that's very much interested in trying to find out the different communities and working out how we actually can respond to them and be for them. And so things like Katie's Outposts, going out into the neighborhoods, but also actually starting up with our social media efforts. We're trying to really start asking people what they want a lot more so we can respond. I think that's very much where we're going as an institution. I think there's a lot of time about the great disruptive network effect of the internet, but it's always great to see these tools put to use for things other than, you know, photo sharing of meals at expensive restaurants or finding... I do that too, you know. You know, it's not all about the vacants and public policy. I mean, yeah, there's a... I posted a photo this morning on my Facebook of my cat who had decided to climb into the dryer, and I thought that was damn funny. Well, cats are what the internet are built for. Thank you. Quite honestly, I saw Tim Berners-Lee in your talk about two years ago, and he was saying, you know, one of the very first things that we were trying to do was send a photo from one colleague's computer to another, and it was a photo of his cat. So actually, the internet is built for cats. I knew it. I knew it. I was making suspicion, but yeah. I didn't realize that, that the first internet pic was... Was trying to send a picture of a cat. There is a reason that our feline overlords are, you know, dominating so much on the internet. There you go. Aside with the canine resistance, but... You don't have any pets, Andrew. No, I grew up with dogs. I'm a dog person, born and bred. Well, I mean, we have gone on quite a while, but it's been fascinating, and... I'm sure we could go on quite a while longer, actually. Oh, yeah, we totally... But then that would involve cocktails. That's what... Maybe there should be an All the Pieces Matter PM version. There you go. This is primarily a caffeinated edition of our show, so we'll see. I think, Sharon, that's going to be your responsibility. Caffeine or cocktails? The cocktail part. Oh, cocktails with caffeine in them. There's always that possibility. It's Red Bull, so it will have to be something else. No, it's not so Montaigne's. Well, I think that we've got to put that in the hopper for development. But in the meantime... Put that in the suggestion box. Yeah. I'm happy to play bartender. I'll send you an anonymous email. Just pretend you don't see my name next time. And this conversation never happened. Yeah. Exactly. Nobody will know. This will be edited out. So are there things that any of you guys would like to plug, or mention, things that are coming up, things that people might want to be on the lookout for? Oh, I'm having a fundraiser and silent art auction on October the 24th at Gallery 788 on Hickory Avenue in Hampton. And it's from 7 to 11 p.m. So a lot of the artists who painted the murals around the city last summer are contributing pieces of their work. And then people can come and bid on them and have drinks and food and bid. And so all the proceeds will go towards Housing Policy Watch. Brilliant. Yeah, I'm really excited. It's going to be a big party because the gallery director, Eduardo, knows how to throw one hell of a party. So I'm excited. Yay, party! And yay, fundraising! Yeah, I have to say, so the BMA is having its own fundraising party as well in November, which is known as our Party of the Century. And it's actually raising funds for, well, it's to celebrate the 100-year anniversary, but it's actually raising funds for our new-to-come Centre for Learning and Creativity. So actually, again, in terms of talking about ways for community to engage, we're creating a space in the museum specifically for that purpose. On our website, which is artbma.org, that's probably the best place to get all of the details for that event. But also for the 100-year celebration, it's kicking off pretty soon. We're having 100 days of celebration in response to the 100 years. And it's going to be, I think, a very busy and very enjoyable time in the museum. But no art auctions? You could take a page from Carol and I can buy Rodin's Thinker from you or something. Nobody's allowed to auction off the museum's pieces. No, it's unlikely that we could do that. She might get a little, you know, she might get in a little trouble. A little bit. Yeah, we might have to raise bad money. I was just kidding. No, I don't think Sharon is. I think she really wants you to heist her. I don't know where I put it. This is what scanners and 3D printers are for, right? Oh, that's been done also. Well, yeah, we have a scan of Rodin's Thinker. We scanned it recently over the summer. We're getting all of the data into a packageable format to get it online. But then you will be able to. I will be able to have my own little version. In bright yellow plastic. Exactly. Hot pink. Just as Rodin originally imagined it would be. Oh, I love that idea. That's so cool. Yeah. He's settled for bronze. And I want to put in a plug for Hack Baltimore's event coming up September 30th at Humanum. At 6 p.m. called Urban Fight, where we'll be taking a look at work that's being done all over the city by all different kinds of people and institutions to combat vacancy, urban blight in Baltimore. And it's a start of a conversation that we hope will continue past that event. But if you're interested in this subject, I mean, we really urge you to come out and join us for that evening. It should be. Should be interesting, if nothing else. Yeah. And it's in this talking about architecture and space and blight in Baltimore. It's in the old American brewery building on Gay Street. And is it in Oliver? Or it's near Oliver, that neighborhood? But it is a magnificent building that's been beautifully restored by Humanum, which is a nonprofit and social enterprise. It's a great place to meet and to kind of take in all the good and bad of the city. Yeah. It's this gorgeous, I don't even know, Beaux-Arts building that's sitting in, I don't know if it's Beaux-Arts. No, it's Mansard style, I think. Yeah. It's got that weird Mansard. But sitting in this, I mean, but sitting in a sea of neglect and vacancy. It's a wasteland. Basically, it sits in the middle of a wasteland. It sits in nothing. It's kind of like one of those still standing houses, though. It's like, well, we are a big institution and we're going to say, you know, this place is worth having a beautifully restored historic building. And they're a great organization, too. They're very involved in the community. They didn't just come and redo this grand building and then lock the doors and windows. Right. They do a lot in the community and the people who work in the building are neighbors. Of the building. And I really like Humanum. Yeah. I mean, as Hack Baltimore, we chose it very intentionally because it's such a great example of what could be with like thoughtfulness and appropriate investment. Yeah. It's just a beacon of what could happen with vacancy in the city.
