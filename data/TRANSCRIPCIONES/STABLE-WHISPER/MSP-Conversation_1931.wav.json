{"text": " intelligence gathering. And a lot of this, especially in intelligence gathering, relies on precisely what you were saying before, the assumption that women are not really active members, are not operationally to be worried about. So it's kind of a blind spot of the federal government and Amazon forces who are there on the ground that women can kind of sneak past or not taken seriously as a security threat. So they can manage to get these explosives through checkpoints, they can gather this intelligence that then helps planning of attacks. So a really quite impressively wide variety of roles that women take on within the operational world of al-Shabaab and not simply the carrying on, of course, of the next generation of fighters, the cultivating of the ideology amongst children. I mean, that we see, I think, in almost all jihadist groups, but really active across the realm of fundraising, intelligence and tactical operations of the group. Now, you said that you were surprised by how deep these roles for women are in al-Shabaab compared to the other jihadi groups you've looked at. Out of those different roles, which are the ones that you found most surprising? I would say the intelligence gathering. Intelligence gathering and ferrying of explosive parts or other small arms that are needed. I mean, those are quite delicate and important roles. And intelligence gathering is really crucial. I mean, if you're using this intelligence to then orchestrate a fairly complex military attack, you know, getting what you need, instructing a woman with what she needs to come back with. This, for example, is something that we have not heard at all with Boko Haram. And perhaps it reflects different and varying societal attitudes towards women and their roles in northeastern Nigeria versus Somalia. But the degree to which al-Shabaab seemed to engage women, rely on them. And, you know, perhaps it's, you know, it was an adaptive thing. I mean, al-Shabaab has faced, you know, increasing pressure from the Amazon forces and the federal government in recent years, I think, especially since 2014. So perhaps it's been adaptive and it's, you know, pragmatic on the side of al-Shabaab. But through that, you know, it relies on women and engages them. And I think this really goes to speak to the fact why it's important to analyze each one of these Islamist insurgencies in the embedded context where they fight, and not just as a broad programs that you see coming out of the international response to these jihadi groups. Yeah, absolutely. You know, al-Shabaab operates in a very orthodox and very Somali way when it comes to the question of women. In a lot of ways, its approach, you know, whatever you might think of its transnational or Salafi, you know, values or ethos gets matched or overridden by Somali values. And it's ultimately, you know, a Somali phenomenon in ways that you could, you know, describe the same dynamic for Boko Haram. So while I think the dynamic of women being key is something that thematically we can pull out, and I think that's what Crisis Group is trying to do by looking at female militancy more closely. But within that, it's absolutely, I think, crucial to look at the particular context rather than imagine this as some, you know, transnational jihadi blob that has a kind of human resource book for women. Now, of course, we should not downplay the restrictive life of a woman living under al-Shabaab, right? Life can be quite harsh for women in areas controlled by al-Shabaab in Somalia. Absolutely. And the things that women kind of report that al-Shabaab offers them, very often, you know, women will invoke its court system and the ability to go to an al-Shabaab court to deal with family law, Islamic family law around divorce or inheritance. You know, this is very much through the absence of state institutions. It's a reliance on Shabaab institutions that comes from an absence of other ones. That might be that would, you know, hopefully for women be more just. You know, it's often said women told us that they rely or appreciate the degree of protection from sexual violence that they get in Shabaab-controlled areas. But again, you know, that's highly contingent on a couple of things. I mean, you know, Shabaab imposes very strict regulations on women's ability to be in public space. They have to be with a male relative at all times. Even if a woman is raped in al-Shabaab territory, but she's been out without her male appointed guardian, you know, from what we've understood, you know, she can't take that case to a Shabaab court. So it's within a really strict kind of regime of highly orthodox and for women highly disempowering regulations in public life that it offers these things that it offers. So given all that, why do you think it is some women choose to be to take an active part in al-Shabaab? So essentially, women and men as well are dealing with the only power in town. So choice is very often a matter of mitigating what would happen to you, the physical costs, the financial costs, the repercussions of not cooperating. That said, I think highlighting the things that it does offer to women, the justice mechanisms is really important because we've learned, for example, through our research and talking to former al-Shabaab wives that divorce is incredibly common in the movement. There's a lot of hardship. Men are constantly deployed. All of the women we spoke to had been divorced, were very disappointed by their marriages. There's, you know, quite prevalent polygamy with men absent, not able to support multiple families, you know, huge dissatisfaction by women. So being able to go to a court, petition for divorce, get some financial support or whatever, whatever is the due of women is a very important thing. I don't think, though, that we can then conflate that with women, you know, broadly subscribing to the whole project of al-Shabaab and its treatment of women, which can be quite punitive in terms of the severity of the dress code, punishments for women who don't uphold it, women who don't follow these regulations. This is a reality. Yeah, this this fact of how many women petition successfully to get divorced within the al-Shabaab movement really jumped out at me in reading the report. And again, really speaks to why it's so important to take a more nuanced approach to this group, because it's not just a militant group. It's also a political movement. And the crisis group has been arguing for some time, you know, that the military response that has been favored, you know, is is is lacking often and in a more nuanced approach to it. I completely agree. I think the divorce prevalence and the theme of divorce highlights just how Somali al-Shabaab is, because Somali society seems to be quite accepting of divorce. It seems quite widespread throughout. But at the same time, Shabaab offers a justice mechanism for women who are trying to navigate their way financially out of out of a divorce or out of the death of a father. So it's operating in a sphere of acute government weakness at the same time, you know, helping women do something that is socially really quite common in their lives. Now, part of what's interesting about all that we found with the role of women in Somalia is that neither the government nor al-Shabaab are obviously keen to advertise this because, you know, most people don't know that they are this active and play such important roles in intelligence and fundraising and recruitment like we found. Now, why is it that we never hear about this and that both sides of this conflict are not very eager to to advertise it? The view of women, you know, by Shabaab officials and we spoke to male fighters, defectors as well to kind of explore and confirm some of the things we heard from women. Women are not really included in the decision making apparatuses are not included in the high level kind of decision making centers and Shabaab. They're not really viewed as full fledged members by Shabaab itself. The men, women who are committed, engaged, active. You know, if you were to ask them, are you with Shabaab? I think they would say yes. So I think partly we're dealing with, you know, a very patriarchal culture, both on the side of al-Shabaab and the government, the federal government that it opposes. So women are both a blind spot, but I think also kind of conventional stereotypical attitudes causes men, whether in the movement or in the federal government, to minimize and perhaps not acknowledge the extent of the role that women play. I think it's worth also mentioning, though, that this aspect of the of the stereotyped role can sometimes work to women's benefit. So we haven't talked yet about women defectors and how hard it is to integrate into, you know, mainstream or non Shabaab area society for women who get out of the group. And there is really acute stigma. Certainly the case with women in Nigeria as well. And in that case, there's, you know, we're talking a whole different volume, tens of thousands of women who've come out of Boko Haram. There's increasing intense stigma. And I think as reintegration, as part of their reintegration experience, the idea that they're just women does play to their advantage. I think communities might be more inclined to tolerate them, accept them because they think that, oh, they were just women. They managed to escape. Wasn't her fault. You know, the kind of ascribed or assumed lack of agency on the other end of coming out of a jihadist group, I think, can help women cope with stigmas. Now, in Nigeria, you found that these blinders that policymakers have, both from the Nigerian government and from international coalitions that are supporting the Nigerians campaign against Boko Haram, that these blinders towards the role of women can really leave some blind spots in our approach to defeating these groups. Can you talk about that? Absolutely. I think that the blind spots can also operate in terms of understanding what motivates women. Right. So one thing that we hear over and over again, and I think I mentioned this before, is that women appreciated the education that Boko Haram offered. A lot of them, a lot of the women that we spoke to said they came out because they wanted their children to have access to primary education. And, you know, Boko Haram, even the name, you know, embodies the idea of opposition to secular or government education. But this has been such a key aim for women and aspiration. And that's something that the government in northeastern Nigeria, the federal government of Nigeria, if it had the political will and the determination, could offer to the states of the northeast who are facing this insurgency. So if you see clearly that this is a key draw, that women say, we want to be educated, we want to feel worthy. We don't really feel like we count as citizens because we're not even offered, you know, basic literacy. But those guys in the bush who launched these heinous attacks and do these other abhorrent things, they think we're worthy of educating. I think that's a pretty compelling thing to be able to understand. It's a question for the Nigerian government and President Buhari. You know, why, if you're hearing over and over again that women are seeking a pathway to education oftentimes and willing to sustain a lot of violence against themselves to get that, you know, why not provide it for them? It's not a big mystery. Now, moving over to Somalia, then, if you're a policymaker and your interest is in strengthening the Somali government and weakening al-Shabaab, what would you advise as the main takeaways from our findings? Two things stand out to me. One is that the federal government really needs a strategy against gender-based violence, whether that is passing a law that, a sexual offenses law that, amongst other things, really penalizes sexual assaults, that raises the age of marriage to 18, that deals with lots of aspects of women and girls' safety. It could take that forward. And it's not simply symbolic. I think it shows that the government takes women's safety and the suffering that they've endured through all of these years of war and clan warfare, that it takes that seriously. I think that is key. And then, secondly, and this is far off, and I think we know that it's far off, on some dispute mechanisms or eventually a court system that can deliver those same things that Shabaab offers, you know, family law courts that can work to women's benefit. I think those are our two main areas that we think are worth focusing on. There's a couple of other things, though. I think there's not a huge number of women who leave the movement, but those who do could use more support integrating. There's the stigma that we talked about. Women in security forces, so that there are women at checkpoints and protection for women in security forces at the same time. So if there's going to be a sharper eye on women's tactical or operational involvement in the group, it's done in a way that doesn't potentially encourage or create a theater for abuse. So we're really aware that the policy conclusions from the work that we've done are just nascent, really, in developing. But I think as themes, these are really important. A strategy against gender-based violence, more women in security forces, and some courts or a court system, however far off it is, to make an effort towards beginning to build one that women can have recourse to.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.84, "text": " intelligence gathering.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [7599, 13519, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.07559080600738526,

And a lot of this, especially in intelligence gathering, relies on precisely what you were saying before, the assumption that women are not really active members, are not operationally to be worried about. So it's kind of a blind spot of the federal government and Amazon forces who are there on the ground that women can kind of sneak past or not taken seriously as a security threat. So they can manage to get these explosives through checkpoints, they can gather this intelligence that then helps planning of attacks. So a really quite impressively wide variety of roles that women take on within the operational world of al-Shabaab and not simply the carrying on, of course, of the next generation of fighters, the cultivating of the ideology amongst children. I mean, that we see, I think, in almost all jihadist groups, but really active across the realm of fundraising, intelligence and tactical operations of the group. Now, you said that you were surprised by how deep these roles for women are in al-Shabaab compared to the other jihadi groups you've looked at. Out of those different roles, which are the ones that you found most surprising? I would say the intelligence gathering. Intelligence gathering and ferrying of explosive parts or other small arms that are needed. I mean, those are quite delicate and important roles. And intelligence gathering is really crucial. I mean, if you're using this intelligence to then orchestrate a fairly complex military attack, you know, getting what you need, instructing a woman with what she needs to come back with. This, for example, is something that we have not heard at all with Boko Haram. And perhaps it reflects different and varying societal attitudes towards women and their roles in northeastern Nigeria versus Somalia. But the degree to which al-Shabaab seemed to engage women, rely on them. And, you know, perhaps it's, you know, it was an adaptive thing. I mean, al-Shabaab has faced, you know, increasing pressure from the Amazon forces and the federal government in recent years, I think, especially since 2014. So perhaps it's been adaptive and it's, you know, pragmatic on the side of al-Shabaab. But through that, you know, it relies on women and engages them. And I think this really goes to speak to the fact why it's important to analyze each one of these Islamist insurgencies in the embedded context where they fight, and not just as a broad programs that you see coming out of the international response to these jihadi groups. Yeah, absolutely. You know, al-Shabaab operates in a very orthodox and very Somali way when it comes to the question of women. In a lot of ways, its approach, you know, whatever you might think of its transnational or Salafi, you know, values or ethos gets matched or overridden by Somali values. And it's ultimately, you know, a Somali phenomenon in ways that you could, you know, describe the same dynamic for Boko Haram. So while I think the dynamic of women being key is something that thematically we can pull out, and I think that's what Crisis Group is trying to do by looking at female militancy more closely. But within that, it's absolutely, I think, crucial to look at the particular context rather than imagine this as some, you know, transnational jihadi blob that has a kind of human resource book for women. Now, of course, we should not downplay the restrictive life of a woman living under al-Shabaab, right? Life can be quite harsh for women in areas controlled by al-Shabaab in Somalia. Absolutely. And the things that women kind of report that al-Shabaab offers them, very often, you know, women will invoke its court system and the ability to go to an al-Shabaab court to deal with family law, Islamic family law around divorce or inheritance. You know, this is very much through the absence of state institutions. It's a reliance on Shabaab institutions that comes from an absence of other ones. That might be that would, you know, hopefully for women be more just. You know, it's often said women told us that they rely or appreciate the degree of protection from sexual violence that they get in Shabaab-controlled areas. But again, you know, that's highly contingent on a couple of things. I mean, you know, Shabaab imposes very strict regulations on women's ability to be in public space. They have to be with a male relative at all times. Even if a woman is raped in al-Shabaab territory, but she's been out without her male appointed guardian, you know, from what we've understood, you know, she can't take that case to a Shabaab court. So it's within a really strict kind of regime of highly orthodox and for women highly disempowering regulations in public life that it offers these things that it offers. So given all that, why do you think it is some women choose to be to take an active part in al-Shabaab? So essentially, women and men as well are dealing with the only power in town. So choice is very often a matter of mitigating what would happen to you, the physical costs, the financial costs, the repercussions of not cooperating. That said, I think highlighting the things that it does offer to women, the justice mechanisms is really important because we've learned, for example, through our research and talking to former al-Shabaab wives that divorce is incredibly common in the movement. There's a lot of hardship. Men are constantly deployed. All of the women we spoke to had been divorced, were very disappointed by their marriages. There's, you know, quite prevalent polygamy with men absent, not able to support multiple families, you know, huge dissatisfaction by women. So being able to go to a court, petition for divorce, get some financial support or whatever, whatever is the due of women is a very important thing. I don't think, though, that we can then conflate that with women, you know, broadly subscribing to the whole project of al-Shabaab and its treatment of women, which can be quite punitive in terms of the severity of the dress code, punishments for women who don't uphold it, women who don't follow these regulations. This is a reality. Yeah, this this fact of how many women petition successfully to get divorced within the al-Shabaab movement really jumped out at me in reading the report. And again, really speaks to why it's so important to take a more nuanced approach to this group, because it's not just a militant group. It's also a political movement. And the crisis group has been arguing for some time, you know, that the military response that has been favored, you know, is is is lacking often and in a more nuanced approach to it. I completely agree. I think the divorce prevalence and the theme of divorce highlights just how Somali al-Shabaab is, because Somali society seems to be quite accepting of divorce. It seems quite widespread throughout. But at the same time, Shabaab offers a justice mechanism for women who are trying to navigate their way financially out of out of a divorce or out of the death of a father. So it's operating in a sphere of acute government weakness at the same time, you know, helping women do something that is socially really quite common in their lives. Now, part of what's interesting about all that we found with the role of women in Somalia is that neither the government nor al-Shabaab are obviously keen to advertise this because, you know, most people don't know that they are this active and play such important roles in intelligence and fundraising and recruitment like we found. Now, why is it that we never hear about this and that both sides of this conflict are not very eager to to advertise it? The view of women, you know, by Shabaab officials and we spoke to male fighters, defectors as well to kind of explore and confirm some of the things we heard from women. Women are not really included in the decision making apparatuses are not included in the high level kind of decision making centers and Shabaab. They're not really viewed as full fledged members by Shabaab itself. The men, women who are committed, engaged, active. You know, if you were to ask them, are you with Shabaab? I think they would say yes. So I think partly we're dealing with, you know, a very patriarchal culture, both on the side of al-Shabaab and the government, the federal government that it opposes. So women are both a blind spot, but I think also kind of conventional stereotypical attitudes causes men, whether in the movement or in the federal government, to minimize and perhaps not acknowledge the extent of the role that women play. I think it's worth also mentioning, though, that this aspect of the of the stereotyped role can sometimes work to women's benefit. So we haven't talked yet about women defectors and how hard it is to integrate into, you know, mainstream or non Shabaab area society for women who get out of the group. And there is really acute stigma. Certainly the case with women in Nigeria as well. And in that case, there's, you know, we're talking a whole different volume, tens of thousands of women who've come out of Boko Haram. There's increasing intense stigma. And I think as reintegration, as part of their reintegration experience, the idea that they're just women does play to their advantage. I think communities might be more inclined to tolerate them, accept them because they think that, oh, they were just women. They managed to escape. Wasn't her fault. You know, the kind of ascribed or assumed lack of agency on the other end of coming out of a jihadist group, I think, can help women cope with stigmas. Now, in Nigeria, you found that these blinders that policymakers have, both from the Nigerian government and from international coalitions that are supporting the Nigerians campaign against Boko Haram, that these blinders towards the role of women can really leave some blind spots in our approach to defeating these groups. Can you talk about that? Absolutely. I think that the blind spots can also operate in terms of understanding what motivates women. Right. So one thing that we hear over and over again, and I think I mentioned this before, is that women appreciated the education that Boko Haram offered. A lot of them, a lot of the women that we spoke to said they came out because they wanted their children to have access to primary education. And, you know, Boko Haram, even the name, you know, embodies the idea of opposition to secular or government education. But this has been such a key aim for women and aspiration. And that's something that the government in northeastern Nigeria, the federal government of Nigeria, if it had the political will and the determination, could offer to the states of the northeast who are facing this insurgency. So if you see clearly that this is a key draw, that women say, we want to be educated, we want to feel worthy. We don't really feel like we count as citizens because we're not even offered, you know, basic literacy. But those guys in the bush who launched these heinous attacks and do these other abhorrent things, they think we're worthy of educating. I think that's a pretty compelling thing to be able to understand. It's a question for the Nigerian government and President Buhari. You know, why, if you're hearing over and over again that women are seeking a pathway to education oftentimes and willing to sustain a lot of violence against themselves to get that, you know, why not provide it for them? It's not a big mystery. Now, moving over to Somalia, then, if you're a policymaker and your interest is in strengthening the Somali government and weakening al-Shabaab, what would you advise as the main takeaways from our findings? Two things stand out to me. One is that the federal government really needs a strategy against gender-based violence, whether that is passing a law that, a sexual offenses law that, amongst other things, really penalizes sexual assaults, that raises the age of marriage to 18, that deals with lots of aspects of women and girls' safety. It could take that forward. And it's not simply symbolic. I think it shows that the government takes women's safety and the suffering that they've endured through all of these years of war and clan warfare, that it takes that seriously. I think that is key. And then, secondly, and this is far off, and I think we know that it's far off, on some dispute mechanisms or eventually a court system that can deliver those same things that Shabaab offers, you know, family law courts that can work to women's benefit. I think those are our two main areas that we think are worth focusing on. There's a couple of other things, though. I think there's not a huge number of women who leave the movement, but those who do could use more support integrating. There's the stigma that we talked about. Women in security forces, so that there are women at checkpoints and protection for women in security forces at the same time. So if there's going to be a sharper eye on women's tactical or operational involvement in the group, it's done in a way that doesn't potentially encourage or create a theater for abuse.
