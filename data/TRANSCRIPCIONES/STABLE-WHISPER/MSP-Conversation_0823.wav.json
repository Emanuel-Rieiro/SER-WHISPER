{"text": " And I really appreciate that. And that's something that we hope to do. That's something we hope to create. So that's our little plug for our podcast there. For ourselves. Instead of an ad break for a sponsor, we just ad break to just plug our own show. No, I agree. I definitely, I think this sort of goes back to when you talk about like talk radio, you might not be, you know, with Dave Bowman, we were just talking about, he's, you know, not the, not the, the guy, you know, screaming and yelling and bound pounding the table. You're going to lose, you're going to lose listeners if, if you're not that, that type of person. But I think as far as the quality goes down when, when, when, when there are shows like that. So I definitely, I really couldn't care. Like, I guess how many people are watching, if we're having these discussions, I think the, the people that are watching also enjoy these types of discussions. And those are the people that I think, you know, I want watching. Yeah, we'll put it out there. And if you want to watch it, great. Exactly. That's fine. You're an idiot though. You're stupid. Yeah. We don't want you to listen anyway. So see you later. No, it was really interesting. I called this episode creation destruction because it was, it was such a mix of, I was trying to figure out what to title this episode and creation destruction was the only thing that happened. And in, in my mind that I could, when, when I, when I was looking at the topics that we were going to be talking about once we got past that initial topic and it was such a rollercoaster of emotions, it was such a, you know, a mix of things that have been happening. And in the news, because we have the Catlin referendum referendum over in Catalonia and Spain where, where people are seeking independence. And then we also, you know, woke up on, on Monday to news of a mass shooting in the United States of, of unprecedented proportions. And you know, and, and it's really like, how do you respond to news like that? It's just like, you know, life is just this, this huge mix of, of perpetual creation and destruction. And, and like, so, so you can receive like really positive, inspiring, hopeful news one day. And then just like, but the very same day you can be getting news about just how awful people can be to each other. And it's really, so, so have you followed any of this, this referendum that, that was happening in Catalonia at all? Or. Yeah, I'd like, I, there was something on one of the podcasts I listened to, they talked about it a little bit. I haven't been following it. Following it too closely. I did look up a little bit before we, we came on. But from what I understand, this is something that's been festering for a while. Sort of Western Europe. Isn't really something I follow too closely. So it just sort of flew under my radar until you kind of brought it to my attention. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and it was something that I didn't, because I follow Julian Assange on Twitter and he actually, I responded to one of my tweets one day. I was like, Julian Assange responded to me. And then I was like looking out my window for the black vans and shit. Yeah. You're in some database somewhere now, Josh. So I know, look what I've done. And now I associated you. So I'm in that database. We're in it together, buddy. Yeah. No, it was crazy. So I follow him on, on Twitter and then he started tweeting these videos. And, and I retweeted one and somebody, somebody who follows me on Twitter had responded to that, that retweet and said, well, you know, one in only one in like nine Spaniards support this blah, blah, blah. You know, kind of indicating that it didn't have widespread support, but I keep seeing these videos of these mass protests flooding in. And so I started kind of following it out of interest and I don't really have a dog in, in that fight. I just, I was watching it as kind of, I thought you were Spanish. I know. I know. It's, it's, it's hard to believe. Yeah. No, nevermind. Um, and, uh, so, so I was watching, uh, it's just kind of curious, curiously following along, you know, while everybody was talking about this take a knee shit, um, you know, that really, I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, the sheer amount of, of divisiveness it caused between people was, it was really unnecessary. Yeah. Um, and, and really it is like, is that the most important thing we can fight about? Um, so I was watching this unfold. And it was, it was kind of fascinating because I, I never really, so apparently, yeah, like you said, this has been kind of an ongoing thing, but, um, it was, it was really interesting to watch because, uh, prior to finding out about this stuff, um, I read books about, I'm, I'm kind of a nerd because I read books like about, um, you know, uh, books like the Prince by Machiavelli or, or, uh, rules for radicals by Alinsky or from dictatorship. To democracy by Jean sharp and books like that fascinate me like tactics for overthrowing or, or, or the ruling class maintaining power, whichever it is. Um, the, the struggle for power fascinates me. And, uh, and watching these protests unfold, I saw specific tactics that were taking place that I had read about in certain, certain books that are, are being disseminated at these places of, of, uh, democratic upsurges. So like in Ukraine, uh, Netflix did this documentary called winter on fire. And then they did a documentary on, on Egypt called the square. Both were about the revolutions that happen in those particular areas. Um, and seeing some of the tactics that the protesters were using, I'm like, Oh, I wonder if, you know, they're reading these same books that, that I've been reading. And, and it was just really fascinating to watch because, and, and reinforce for me the importance of like, positive, whether it's PR or propaganda or whatever in the digital age, because what they did in Catalonia, uh, largely shifted a lot of, uh, either people who wouldn't care or public perception in favor of the Catalonians. And now, you know, because whenever they crack down on, on protesters, whenever the government comes in and starts beating unarmed people and, and whatnot, no matter what your argument from, from the Spanish side of things, whether it's, you know, this is unconstitutional, and so therefore their referendum is, is illegitimate or things like that. And whether you're trying to restore order for your country, you're, you're going to be losing the propaganda battle because of the actions of the police in this regard. Yeah. It's a true underdog story. I do have a Sun Tzu's art of war on the shelf. And I would love to, uh, I'm sorry. I was reading the comments here and I would love to come to idea camp because it sounds really good. Really, really cool. And Fond du Lac. Um, so Jeanette and Russ. Um, yeah. So it was crazy to watch it unfold. And so like, I can only, I can't offer, um, insight into, um, the political turbulence in Spain because I don't live in Spain. I can only read what outside sources do, but I just kind of want to get your, your kind of thoughts on, on, on your reactions to what was going on over there. I haven't really seen any of the videos. Um, I think I saw, I saw one, um, but I haven't, um, like I said, looked into this too closely. Um, but this just sort of looking at the broad picture, this is sort of this never ending struggle of, um, we saw it, especially after world war two, but of, um, of sort of areas that are trying to take back control of, I guess, um, you know, trying to govern themselves and sort of, um, um, I, this reminds me, like you said, of, uh, of the square in Egypt or of, of sort of, um, I know those situations were a little bit different when you have sort of an autocratic government. Um, but it definitely, for me, um, I, I do enjoy these types of stories when it comes to, um, people trying to take control of, uh, of, um, of, I guess the, their own destiny and their own sort of government, um, and trying to, um, uh, I guess, um, this is just, uh, I guess for my own clarification, this is just sort of, uh, this region just wants to be autonomous. So they, they, um, they had a referendum that was like 90%. Yeah. Yeah. 90, 90, 90% of those who voted were, were in favor of it. Those who were able to vote. So then Spain, uh, just kind of, well, he said it was unconstitutional, right? And then they, yeah, Spain is like, you guys shouldn't even be having a referendum. So, you know, we're going to shut this down. And, uh, because you're acting and, you know, you're not allowed to see, um, which is essentially what this, and, and, and, and part of it from what I'm reading from, from various articles online. And part of it is the fact that Catalonia is not only it's wealthy, but it's about 22%, 22%, the small area of, of Spain's GDP. So they have economic reasons for not wanting the Catalonians to seed, um, which is, it's, it's, it's, it's fascinating. It really is fascinating to watch. Yeah. I'm trying to think of what, like 22% of the U S economy, what New York and California or something. If I mean like, you know, trying to like put it in that perspective of if, if both of them were like, yeah, we're going to secede and we're not going to be, I mean, it's trying to put it in those terms and try to see, I guess, um, uh, the mindset of, of these people. And, and, uh, I guess what, uh, the one video I did see, um, it is also heartening to see people sort of take to the streets, um, and protest, uh, these types of things. Um, so that the, you know, these people aren't passive, they're, they're actively trying to, um, trying to take control of their own futures. So that's something that I definitely, uh, I definitely do like seeing. Well, and it's crazy because like we, we all want to see a story like that, right? I mean, this, this is kind of innate within our, I guess, our human DNA. Like you said, this is like an ongoing struggle. Like you see, this throughout the ages and, you know, you see, you know, um, whether it's governments or rulers become tyrannical and then people rise up after they've had enough and, you know, they start all over again and it's this perpetual cycle. Um, but, but what's really interesting to me is, is, um, being in the skeptical position I am in, in the age I am in the age we're in, um, you know, that could be the genuine authentic reason for why they're doing what they're doing. Or they could be being mobilized by behind the scenes agitators, uh, for, uh, do you think it's George Soros? Well, that's, that's what I'm saying is like, you know, after, after any like sort of like major protest in the United States, you, you hear the right wingers talk about George Soros or whatever, or you hear, um, um, after like the tea party and stuff like that, people like the tea party uprising in the U S um, during the Obama administration, you heard, you know, Democrats, uh, you know, uh, yelling about the Koch brothers and, and, and all of these, uh, these corporate boogeymen and who are, who are financing these sorts of things. Behind the scenes. So it's not truly grassroots. It's, you know, yeah. Yeah. Delegitimizing any sort of opposition. Um, and it's really, really interesting to try to find the truth in the midst of all this, uh, uh, speculation. Yeah. Yeah. Man, those are two good S words we came up with there. Right. Uh, double threat. Um, but yeah, so, so it's, it's fascinating to watch, but I want to believe that what's going on is just at face value. I want to take it at face value because it's such an inspiring sort of thing. And they're going to win the PR battle if they, if they continue on. And if they continue to be, um, nonviolent or, and, you know, or even if they turn violent after a period of time where they're being brutalized, you, they'll still have the sympathy of, of, of the global community. But does that, does that help though, that they have the sympathy of the global? Cause I'm thinking after you, you clarified it there. I was wondering if you meant like it's good PR where, I mean, for the rest of the world, like we're not Spaniards. We were not from Spain. Like I, um, I guess Spain losing 22% of its economy. Uh, if this referendum were to go through to, it doesn't really affect me, but I think like internally, do you think this is good PR for, um, other, other Spaniards? Like you said, one in one in 10 people support this. Is that enough to sort of turn the tides or are these, uh, these people rationalizing that, um, that these people are doing something unconstitutional, um, and they don't agree with it so that the police are, um, you know, doing what they can to sort of quash this uprising. Um, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, it's, it's not enough to turn, uh, public opinion, but if they continue the tactics that they're doing, they will end up swaying fellow Spaniards and actually may, cause I think Spain has like some, something like, uh, 15, 15 provinces or like there, there's a certain number of provinces, kind of like we have the States. And I think one of the things they're concerned about and, and the EU is concerned about as well, is that a Catalonian independence movement will actually spur other, um, elements of the Spanish nation to break apart. And, uh, and, and that is one general as, as long as they keep broadcasting and keep, uh, garnering sympathy, for, for innocent civilians being beaten down by the brutal police, um, they will generally, it generally always happens that they gradually sway public opinion. And that's why, that's why the, the digital freedom and whatnot is, is so important because it's, it's essential and vital to movements like this to, to convince their fellow Spaniards or, or, or whoever. Um, so, so global opinion may not matter, but the more people are sharing this, the more that they're, they're, circulating it on the internet that, that may reach more people. And, and you may, you know, I, it's, it's a crucial misstep of, of governments to, to crack down because that kind of hastens the end of their, generally. Yeah. That's sort of the last resort, you know, basically trying, trying to, uh, um, quell any, anything before it gets worse. Um, yeah, governments, governments have their best shot. If you're, if you're looking at kind of more of an off there, authoritarian regime, their best shot in is in giving people the illusion of freedom and the illusion of choice and keeping them satisfied in that regard, rather than, you know, coming out and clamping down. Mm-hmm. Agree. Can I just say how much of a, uh, how much fun the word Spaniard is to say? It just like, it comes out of the mouth so well. And just like when I first said Spaniard there, it's just, it's always, uh, it's just a nice word. It's really funny because, uh, whenever I hear that word, I think of the, the part in, in, uh, the princess bride where he's scaling that, the cliffs of insanity or whatever. And he's like, um, I promise I won't kill you until you reach the top. And he's like, I give you my word as a Spaniard. He's like, no good. I've known too many Spaniards. I actually have not seen that movie. I saw parts of it. The, uh, the famous, um, what is it? Uh, poisoning of whichever drink. Um, scene. Um, uh, we watched that in my game theory class. Um, but I haven't, uh, I know I told you that was Ted Cruz's favorite movie. Um, I'm serious. Yeah. They used to have like watching parties. Movie. What's his first favorite movie? Oh, we all found out about that on Twitter recently. So. Oh, that was a burn. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh man. I'm a little disappointed. The internet kind of, I forgot about that already. That was sort of like a couple of days and, um, you just stay in. I don't know. Yeah. That was funny. Um, so then on, on the other side of the world though, uh, so we, so we had Catalonia it's in events unfolding in there and I'll continue to watch with interest to see what happens because I'm very, very interested to know how this all ends. Um, but then we have the destructive element and, and, and, um, I mean, they're really, I mean, it's kind of stupid for me to ask you like, what are your, what, what are your impressions of what happened in Vegas? Because I mean, like, it's obviously it's a, it's a horrifying thing, right? Yeah. I mean, it, I'm, yeah, I, I just, I remember waking up and looking at my phone and I had a notification that there was a shooting and I, like I was, I was almost sick when I, when I, cause it didn't have any details until I opened the actual article. Um, and when you see 50 people dead, 500 injured, we were talking about almost 600 casualties. Um, I couldn't even like comprehend it, you know, I just woke up and it's just, it, to me, it's incomprehensible to, to imagine that sort of, um, that sort of carnage. Uh, it's yeah, it was just truly disturbing. Um, I, I haven't even looked at it. I haven't looked at any of the, um, I think I've said this before, but a lot of times when these events happen, I, I kind of, I follow it, but I try to keep my distance for a couple of days, a little bit, because a lot of times it's just speculation. Um, you know, false, false information is spread rapidly. Um, and, and you just don't know sometimes. So, um, it's, it's just, um, uh, yeah, I just don't know what else to say about it. No. And I, I think you're, you're, you're absolutely right. And, and not knowing how to react. I think everybody kind of processes these things sort of differently. And, um, I, I think the really, really sad thing is, um, you know, about these sorts of incidents is just seeing the same, the same drama play out after every single one. Oh, it's predictable. Yeah. It's, it's ridiculously predictable. I mean, like you, you have this deluge of, of stuff. And I try, I tried my best to, to stay out of the fray. This time around and just observe, uh, largely. Um, and there, there were a couple of things I commented on, but I, I didn't really get into two huge fights with people, um, about it because at, at the end of the day, like you said, not all the information is known and, and we're still waiting for information to come out and, and try to figure out what was going on and why, you know, we were trying to piece together the why. And I think people just have this need to know.

{"text": " And I really appreciate that. And that's something that we hope to do. That's something we hope to create. So that's our little plug for our podcast there. For ourselves. Instead of an ad break for a sponsor, we just ad break to just plug our own show. No, I agree. I definitely, I think this sort of goes back to when you talk about like talk radio, you might not be, you know, with Dave Bowman, we were just talking about, he's, you know, not the, not the, the guy, you know, screaming and yelling and bound pounding the table. You're going to lose, you're going to lose listeners if, if you're not that, that type of person. But I think as far as the quality goes down when, when, when, when there are shows like that. So I definitely, I really couldn't care. Like, I guess how many people are watching, if we're having these discussions, I think the, the people that are watching also enjoy these types of discussions. And those are the people that I think, you know, I want watching. Yeah, we'll put it out there. And if you want to watch it, great. Exactly. That's fine. You're an idiot though. You're stupid. Yeah. We don't want you to listen anyway. So see you later. No, it was really interesting. I called this episode creation destruction because it was, it was such a mix of, I was trying to figure out what to title this episode and creation destruction was the only thing that happened. And in, in my mind that I could, when, when I, when I was looking at the topics that we were going to be talking about once we got past that initial topic and it was such a rollercoaster of emotions, it was such a, you know, a mix of things that have been happening. And in the news, because we have the Catlin referendum referendum over in Catalonia and Spain where, where people are seeking independence. And then we also, you know, woke up on, on Monday to news of a mass shooting in the United States of, of unprecedented proportions. And you know, and, and it's really like, how do you respond to news like that? It's just like, you know, life is just this, this huge mix of, of perpetual creation and destruction. And, and like, so, so you can receive like really positive, inspiring, hopeful news one day. And then just like, but the very same day you can be getting news about just how awful people can be to each other. And it's really, so, so have you followed any of this, this referendum that, that was happening in Catalonia at all? Or. Yeah, I'd like, I, there was something on one of the podcasts I listened to, they talked about it a little bit. I haven't been following it. Following it too closely. I did look up a little bit before we, we came on. But from what I understand, this is something that's been festering for a while. Sort of Western Europe. Isn't really something I follow too closely. So it just sort of flew under my radar until you kind of brought it to my attention. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and it was something that I didn't, because I follow Julian Assange on Twitter and he actually, I responded to one of my tweets one day. I was like, Julian Assange responded to me. And then I was like looking out my window for the black vans and shit. Yeah. You're in some database somewhere now, Josh. So I know, look what I've done. And now I associated you. So I'm in that database. We're in it together, buddy. Yeah. No, it was crazy. So I follow him on, on Twitter and then he started tweeting these videos. And, and I retweeted one and somebody, somebody who follows me on Twitter had responded to that, that retweet and said, well, you know, one in only one in like nine Spaniards support this blah, blah, blah. You know, kind of indicating that it didn't have widespread support, but I keep seeing these videos of these mass protests flooding in. And so I started kind of following it out of interest and I don't really have a dog in, in that fight. I just, I was watching it as kind of, I thought you were Spanish. I know. I know. It's, it's, it's hard to believe. Yeah. No, nevermind. Um, and, uh, so, so I was watching, uh, it's just kind of curious, curiously following along, you know, while everybody was talking about this take a knee shit, um, you know, that really, I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, the sheer amount of, of divisiveness it caused between people was, it was really unnecessary. Yeah. Um, and, and really it is like, is that the most important thing we can fight about? Um, so I was watching this unfold. And it was, it was kind of fascinating because I, I never really, so apparently, yeah, like you said, this has been kind of an ongoing thing, but, um, it was, it was really interesting to watch because, uh, prior to finding out about this stuff, um, I read books about, I'm, I'm kind of a nerd because I read books like about, um, you know, uh, books like the Prince by Machiavelli or, or, uh, rules for radicals by Alinsky or from dictatorship. To democracy by Jean sharp and books like that fascinate me like tactics for overthrowing or, or, or the ruling class maintaining power, whichever it is. Um, the, the struggle for power fascinates me. And, uh, and watching these protests unfold, I saw specific tactics that were taking place that I had read about in certain, certain books that are, are being disseminated at these places of, of, uh, democratic upsurges. So like in Ukraine, uh, Netflix did this documentary called winter on fire. And then they did a documentary on, on Egypt called the square. Both were about the revolutions that happen in those particular areas. Um, and seeing some of the tactics that the protesters were using, I'm like, Oh, I wonder if, you know, they're reading these same books that, that I've been reading. And, and it was just really fascinating to watch because, and, and reinforce for me the importance of like, positive, whether it's PR or propaganda or whatever in the digital age, because what they did in Catalonia, uh, largely shifted a lot of, uh, either people who wouldn't care or public perception in favor of the Catalonians. And now, you know, because whenever they crack down on, on protesters, whenever the government comes in and starts beating unarmed people and, and whatnot, no matter what your argument from, from the Spanish side of things, whether it's, you know, this is unconstitutional, and so therefore their referendum is, is illegitimate or things like that. And whether you're trying to restore order for your country, you're, you're going to be losing the propaganda battle because of the actions of the police in this regard. Yeah. It's a true underdog story. I do have a Sun Tzu's art of war on the shelf. And I would love to, uh, I'm sorry. I was reading the comments here and I would love to come to idea camp because it sounds really good. Really, really cool. And Fond du Lac. Um, so Jeanette and Russ. Um, yeah. So it was crazy to watch it unfold. And so like, I can only, I can't offer, um, insight into, um, the political turbulence in Spain because I don't live in Spain. I can only read what outside sources do, but I just kind of want to get your, your kind of thoughts on, on, on your reactions to what was going on over there. I haven't really seen any of the videos. Um, I think I saw, I saw one, um, but I haven't, um, like I said, looked into this too closely. Um, but this just sort of looking at the broad picture, this is sort of this never ending struggle of, um, we saw it, especially after world war two, but of, um, of sort of areas that are trying to take back control of, I guess, um, you know, trying to govern themselves and sort of, um, um, I, this reminds me, like you said, of, uh, of the square in Egypt or of, of sort of, um, I know those situations were a little bit different when you have sort of an autocratic government. Um, but it definitely, for me, um, I, I do enjoy these types of stories when it comes to, um, people trying to take control of, uh, of, um, of, I guess the, their own destiny and their own sort of government, um, and trying to, um, uh, I guess, um, this is just, uh, I guess for my own clarification, this is just sort of, uh, this region just wants to be autonomous. So they, they, um, they had a referendum that was like 90%. Yeah. Yeah. 90, 90, 90% of those who voted were, were in favor of it. Those who were able to vote. So then Spain, uh, just kind of, well, he said it was unconstitutional, right? And then they, yeah, Spain is like, you guys shouldn't even be having a referendum. So, you know, we're going to shut this down. And, uh, because you're acting and, you know, you're not allowed to see, um, which is essentially what this, and, and, and, and part of it from what I'm reading from, from various articles online. And part of it is the fact that Catalonia is not only it's wealthy, but it's about 22%, 22%, the small area of, of Spain's GDP. So they have economic reasons for not wanting the Catalonians to seed, um, which is, it's, it's, it's, it's fascinating. It really is fascinating to watch. Yeah. I'm trying to think of what, like 22% of the U S economy, what New York and California or something. If I mean like, you know, trying to like put it in that perspective of if, if both of them were like, yeah, we're going to secede and we're not going to be, I mean, it's trying to put it in those terms and try to see, I guess, um, uh, the mindset of, of these people. And, and, uh, I guess what, uh, the one video I did see, um, it is also heartening to see people sort of take to the streets, um, and protest, uh, these types of things. Um, so that the, you know, these people aren't passive, they're, they're actively trying to, um, trying to take control of their own futures. So that's something that I definitely, uh, I definitely do like seeing. Well, and it's crazy because like we, we all want to see a story like that, right? I mean, this, this is kind of innate within our, I guess, our human DNA. Like you said, this is like an ongoing struggle. Like you see, this throughout the ages and, you know, you see, you know, um, whether it's governments or rulers become tyrannical and then people rise up after they've had enough and, you know, they start all over again and it's this perpetual cycle. Um, but, but what's really interesting to me is, is, um, being in the skeptical position I am in, in the age I am in the age we're in, um, you know, that could be the genuine authentic reason for why they're doing what they're doing. Or they could be being mobilized by behind the scenes agitators, uh, for, uh, do you think it's George Soros? Well, that's, that's what I'm saying is like, you know, after, after any like sort of like major protest in the United States, you, you hear the right wingers talk about George Soros or whatever, or you hear, um, um, after like the tea party and stuff like that, people like the tea party uprising in the U S um, during the Obama administration, you heard, you know, Democrats, uh, you know, uh, yelling about the Koch brothers and, and, and all of these, uh, these corporate boogeymen and who are, who are financing these sorts of things. Behind the scenes. So it's not truly grassroots. It's, you know, yeah. Yeah. Delegitimizing any sort of opposition. Um, and it's really, really interesting to try to find the truth in the midst of all this, uh, uh, speculation. Yeah. Yeah. Man, those are two good S words we came up with there. Right. Uh, double threat. Um, but yeah, so, so it's, it's fascinating to watch, but I want to believe that what's going on is just at face value. I want to take it at face value because it's such an inspiring sort of thing. And they're going to win the PR battle if they, if they continue on. And if they continue to be, um, nonviolent or, and, you know, or even if they turn violent after a period of time where they're being brutalized, you, they'll still have the sympathy of, of, of the global community. But does that, does that help though, that they have the sympathy of the global? Cause I'm thinking after you, you clarified it there. I was wondering if you meant like it's good PR where, I mean, for the rest of the world, like we're not Spaniards. We were not from Spain. Like I, um, I guess Spain losing 22% of its economy. Uh, if this referendum were to go through to, it doesn't really affect me, but I think like internally, do you think this is good PR for, um, other, other Spaniards? Like you said, one in one in 10 people support this. Is that enough to sort of turn the tides or are these, uh, these people rationalizing that, um, that these people are doing something unconstitutional, um, and they don't agree with it so that the police are, um, you know, doing what they can to sort of quash this uprising. Um, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, it's, it's not enough to turn, uh, public opinion, but if they continue the tactics that they're doing, they will end up swaying fellow Spaniards and actually may, cause I think Spain has like some, something like, uh, 15, 15 provinces or like there, there's a certain number of provinces, kind of like we have the States. And I think one of the things they're concerned about and, and the EU is concerned about as well, is that a Catalonian independence movement will actually spur other, um, elements of the Spanish nation to break apart. And, uh, and, and that is one general as, as long as they keep broadcasting and keep, uh, garnering sympathy, for, for innocent civilians being beaten down by the brutal police, um, they will generally, it generally always happens that they gradually sway public opinion. And that's why, that's why the, the digital freedom and whatnot is, is so important because it's, it's essential and vital to movements like this to, to convince their fellow Spaniards or, or, or whoever. Um, so, so global opinion may not matter, but the more people are sharing this, the more that they're, they're, circulating it on the internet that, that may reach more people. And, and you may, you know, I, it's, it's a crucial misstep of, of governments to, to crack down because that kind of hastens the end of their, generally. Yeah. That's sort of the last resort, you know, basically trying, trying to, uh, um, quell any, anything before it gets worse. Um, yeah, governments, governments have their best shot. If you're, if you're looking at kind of more of an off there, authoritarian regime, their best shot in is in giving people the illusion of freedom and the illusion of choice and keeping them satisfied in that regard, rather than, you know, coming out and clamping down. Mm-hmm. Agree. Can I just say how much of a, uh, how much fun the word Spaniard is to say? It just like, it comes out of the mouth so well. And just like when I first said Spaniard there, it's just, it's always, uh, it's just a nice word. It's really funny because, uh, whenever I hear that word, I think of the, the part in, in, uh, the princess bride where he's scaling that, the cliffs of insanity or whatever. And he's like, um, I promise I won't kill you until you reach the top. And he's like, I give you my word as a Spaniard. He's like, no good. I've known too many Spaniards. I actually have not seen that movie. I saw parts of it. The, uh, the famous, um, what is it? Uh, poisoning of whichever drink. Um, scene. Um, uh, we watched that in my game theory class. Um, but I haven't, uh, I know I told you that was Ted Cruz's favorite movie. Um, I'm serious. Yeah. They used to have like watching parties. Movie. What's his first favorite movie? Oh, we all found out about that on Twitter recently. So. Oh, that was a burn. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh man. I'm a little disappointed. The internet kind of, I forgot about that already. That was sort of like a couple of days and, um, you just stay in. I don't know. Yeah. That was funny. Um, so then on, on the other side of the world though, uh, so we, so we had Catalonia it's in events unfolding in there and I'll continue to watch with interest to see what happens because I'm very, very interested to know how this all ends. Um, but then we have the destructive element and, and, and, um, I mean, they're really, I mean, it's kind of stupid for me to ask you like, what are your, what, what are your impressions of what happened in Vegas? Because I mean, like, it's obviously it's a, it's a horrifying thing, right? Yeah. I mean, it, I'm, yeah, I, I just, I remember waking up and looking at my phone and I had a notification that there was a shooting and I, like I was, I was almost sick when I, when I, cause it didn't have any details until I opened the actual article. Um, and when you see 50 people dead, 500 injured, we were talking about almost 600 casualties. Um, I couldn't even like comprehend it, you know, I just woke up and it's just, it, to me, it's incomprehensible to, to imagine that sort of, um, that sort of carnage. Uh, it's yeah, it was just truly disturbing. Um, I, I haven't even looked at it. I haven't looked at any of the, um, I think I've said this before, but a lot of times when these events happen, I, I kind of, I follow it, but I try to keep my distance for a couple of days, a little bit, because a lot of times it's just speculation. Um, you know, false, false information is spread rapidly. Um, and, and you just don't know sometimes. So, um, it's, it's just, um, uh, yeah, I just don't know what else to say about it. No. And I, I think you're, you're, you're absolutely right. And, and not knowing how to react. I think everybody kind of processes these things sort of differently. And, um, I, I think the really, really sad thing is, um, you know, about these sorts of incidents is just seeing the same, the same drama play out after every single one. Oh, it's predictable. Yeah. It's, it's ridiculously predictable. I mean, like you, you have this deluge of, of stuff. And I try, I tried my best to, to stay out of the fray. This time around and just observe, uh, largely. Um, and there, there were a couple of things I commented on, but I, I didn't really get into two huge fights with people, um, about it because at, at the end of the day, like you said, not all the information is known and, and we're still waiting for information to come out and, and try to figure out what was going on and why, you know, we were trying to piece together the why. And I think people just have this need to know.
