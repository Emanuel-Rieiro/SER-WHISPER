{"text": " joining you in the studio tonight. It's Ian here. Allie. And Michelle. Let's go right back into your calls here in just a moment. But I know, Allie, you had some further thoughts you wanted to, I guess, express regarding the police and them targeting the government people, targeting minorities. Right. So I think that there's definitely a group of cops and government agents out there that are just simply racists. But I don't think that the disparities that you see in the demographics and incarceration rates is just about racist cops. I think a lot of it has to do with basically racist legislation, like a lot of this legislation that we consider to be, oh, it helps minorities get ahead. Think of the times that a lot of this legislation passed. It wasn't when we had total tolerance of minorities. A lot of it was meant to keep white people from having to compete with minorities as far as labor and jobs went. It's true. And it's been packaged as something that's meant to help these people. And it's really, they call it like knocking out the rings of the economic ladder. So it makes it more difficult for them to catch up. So when you're in poverty, it's much more likely that you're going to be arrested and incarcerated than if you have a steady job, family. So it's not so much a racist thing as it is something that targets poor people. Economic conditions. Right. And not only are you more likely to be arrested if you're poor, but you're also less likely to be able to successfully start your business or your own business because of what you're talking about with these regulations that make it so difficult to open up a business. Maybe it's a zoning regulation. Maybe they just won't let you run businesses out of your home where you live, maybe like a city. There's just zoning that just won't allow that. They'll shut you down for that. Like hair braiding and stuff. I knew some girls that were really good at doing cornrows. I had my hair done. But you can't really, you can't pay for that. You can't pay someone to do that legally. I mean, I think it happens anyway, but you're not supposed to be paying someone to have your, to braid your hair for you. Well, unless they have some sort of a permit, right? Right. Unless they have a permit and a shop and probably a certain number of sinks and all this different stuff. Right. And now you're talking about serious cash. I mean, the average poor person is not going to be able to afford all of that, you know, the renovations that would be required to open up a storefront. But if it's a matter of letting people come into their home and provide them with a service there, that's something that someone who's poor can do. But the fact is these regulations keep them from even getting to that point. Or if they do just go ahead and open up their own place, then all of a sudden they've got men with guns threatening them and telling them, oh, well, you don't have your permission slip. So therefore you either shut down or we take you to jail. It was kind of hard to have dialogue with her because she just kept talking or whatever. But I really wanted to move the conversation away from race to the economic aspect and then get to that, which was why I was getting at the question of her voting. Voting for Obama or not, because really it's a condition of economics and everyone, black, white, you know, has suffered from this economy that is not just the. I wouldn't blame Obama for that. You can't. Right. That was actually the beginning of her call was that, you know, she said you can't blame Obama for the economy. And she's she's right. Many people look to him to fix it, though. Well, that's true, too. And he's not going to fix it. And but he can't be singularly blamed. He and all the politicians that are in there and everybody that came before him are to be blamed. I mean, so George Bush, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, all of these people have been just screwing people left and right. They've been raising taxes, increasing regulations and making it so people can't grow their own businesses and help themselves. And it's just it's been a long time coming. The economy did not just screw up because Obama got elected. It's ridiculous to think that that's true. But it's not getting better because of Obama. It's not. You know, it could certainly get worse because of Obama in the same way that it would have been getting worse had John McCain been elected as well. We'd be experiencing similar problems if John McCain had been elected. Right. I feel privileged to be a white female, which means I'm least likely to ever be incarcerated and that I have the opportunity to actually learn about the way the economy works. And, you know, it doesn't surprise me that these people who are in this desperate situation are just waiting for someone to just tell them that they're willing to do something to help them. You know, if they've been taught their whole lives that government's the answer to the problems of poverty, then, you know, you're not going to hear Mitt Romney going out there saying, oh, yes, we need to help minorities. Well, it's so I don't know if they've been taught that government is the answer to the problem of poverty, but they certainly know that government is the problem. I mean, I think a lot of them are aware that government is standing in the way of them creating their own business. Oh, I don't agree with that at all. Totally disagree. I think it's like a local federal thing. Like as far as the local government goes, they know that they're corrupt because they see those those people all the time coming around and messing around. But maybe they see like the federal government is some kind of savior to like come in and stop the abuse. I don't know. With what do you disagree, Michelle? The idea that this this segment of the population, I'm going to I'm going to say African-American from the South who's unemployed and and has had multiple generations of poverty. I've I lived in Nashville, Tennessee. I also lived in Alabama. And so in those four years, having especially having come out from the West where you can't if if if your eyes are closed, you can't really tell the difference between someone who is black and white when they speak and what have you. When you go to the South, it was it was such a shock for us. And I kept saying, man, these people just don't know that they can walk off the plantation. You know, there was a there was a difference. Black people in general, as if they're from a low socioeconomic class, they defer to white people. Even now, even though they're no longer slaves, they still defer. Everyone's a slave now. I'm talking. You mean the old chattel slavery? Yes. And so. So, yeah, there there is there are behavioral differences between Southern blacks and I don't feel comfortable to put people in groups like that. I don't feel comfortable like that at all. I never got the I never got the sense that they were that like I never saw people from Alabama, by the way. Right. I'm from Alabama. I never. I there's like a there's a level of awkwardness in as far as the differences in race. And if it what it comes from is people being insecure and thinking there's a reason for that, though. And it's all it's all integrated in because the government was the one that, quote unquote, freed people rather than their being the organic process that would have occurred had, you know, Lincoln not interfered. And if because people were already releasing their slaves or had already been a societal change. Now, I'll give you an example. I went to a wedding back in 2006 in Alabama, in Birmingham. And it was, you know, rather wealthy, well-to-do family. There were 600 guests invited as a big wedding. And and the housekeeper who had worked for the family for 30 years and had been kind of like nanny to the two children who are now in their 30s had had raised them, changed their diapers, what have you. I was told this woman is a part of the family. Her name is Myrtle. She was so, you know, so nice. And she was, of course, part of the family. Well, I was trying to buzz around and help with wedding things. You know, I was a guest in their home, but I wasn't part of the wedding party. So I was trying to be helpful. And I asked if they'd like me to go pick up Myrtle to take her to the wedding because I knew she didn't drive. And they said, well, why would Myrtle go to the wedding? I said, what do you mean? Why would Myrtle go to the wedding? And she goes, there aren't going to be any of her people there. This is a college educated woman who said this. Is she white? She's white. Okay. She's white. So so it hadn't even occurred to her. She ended up inviting Myrtle at the last minute to go to the reception. And this gal took her two daughters and was at the reception. And they stuck to themselves the whole time. And when my kids... But that doesn't mean anything about people in the South in general, blacks in the South who are, you know, poor. I don't think it's fair to make these generalizations. Okay. I mean, people are different. I think that it's true. I think it's great that someone else would call in and support what I was talking about because I know I'm right here. We can get to your calls. I mean, I'm sorry. Maybe there's... I think there's truth in the statement that blacks in the South are still being kept down by the man. I think that's true. And that they're being, you know, indoctrinated in government, you know, schools, which is going to lead towards some trends and tendencies. Perpetual poverty. That doesn't mean that there aren't black people in the South who want to start their own businesses and become... My best friend was black. That's not what I said. I did not say that.

That's bbs.freetalklive.com. We were talking about how the man is keeping poor people down, because that's generally what's true. Although I think there's definitely evidence that certain poor people are targeted more often than others, specifically blacks and Hispanics, especially if we're talking about being in the South. And although it may be true across the board. But definitely poor people are targeted because they're just easier to run roughshod over. I mean, the rich people can hire lawyers, and lawyers can be tough to deal with if you're the government, the police and all that. I was never sued, though, when I didn't have any money, and I've been sued lots of times since I did. So there is definitely more money and more problems. That's true. But, you know, there's a certain level of poverty where it's like crushing, like, you know, toss me something. No, but I actually had a lawyer say the last time I was in court, this woman is picking on a poor minister. Well, then you're getting sued by another human being, right? You're getting sued by another person. Whereas with the government, people are picking on people. They do tend to pick on poor people, at least for little stuff like, you know, stopping them from having business regulations, stopping them with business regulations from having a business in the first place. Certainly, when you start to get a bunch of money, then the government becomes interested in taking that from you. So, I mean, being rich isn't a way to necessarily solve all your problems, but it is going to lessen the likelihood that you're going to be pulled over on the side of the road and arrested for the possession of a joint. Let's just say that. Whereas poor people, much more likely to be targeted for these things. And then that ruins their lives because, as we talked about earlier, they then get a criminal charge on their record. It becomes then more difficult to get a job, which then makes maybe more likely they're going to be depressed and continue drinking or pick up some other kind of drug habits. It's just a nasty cycle that continues on. And like I said earlier to the caller previously, I wish there was some sort of hope for seeing this stuff change in the future, but I just don't see it happening. I mean, there's actually a news piece in... God, where is it? But she is looking to have her vote count and to march on, I guess, City Hall or the courts in order to effect change. And I don't blame her for thinking that. I mean, a lot of people believe that that's how things are going to have to change, that they're going to have to change the system. And I think it's true. The system's going to have to change unless all of a sudden all of these bureaucrats that work for the police departments are going to wake up and start thinking freedom-oriented and stop enforcing bad laws on people. Until then, you're going to have stories like the one out of Long Beach where the police went into a pot medical cannabis shop and basically beat the occupants and proceeded to destroy equipment in the shop. There's footage of one of the police officers with a club bashing the hell out of a video, a surveillance camera in there, to obscure the rest of the damage that they then proceeded to do after the camera had been destroyed. There was video footage of one of these officers basically crushing a man with his full weight. And these guys weren't violent. They weren't dangerous. They're operating an open marijuana shop in California where this thing should be legal. Why were they raided? They didn't have a permit. So once again, because they might have been poor and they did seem to be black gentlemen that were operating this shop, they had enough wealth to go through the process of opening the shop. But maybe they didn't know enough about the legal land framework to hire a lawyer to make sure that all their T's were crossed and all their I's were dotted as far as whatever legal... Because they were legal by California state law. It was the local ordinance that they didn't have. They didn't have the local permit to occupy that space. So the cops came in and did a raid just like they would do on any illegal marijuana facility. On somebody's business. And somebody is being confiscated from you to hand over to thugs that will go in and steal from your neighbor and destroy your neighbor's property. Right. So they keep using... How do y'all feel about that? It's terrible. And I think that's one of the things that our earlier caller was referring to where she feels frustrated and would like to have some of that relieved. Would like to make it so that her, you know, people she considers her brothers and sisters are not going to be crushed in this way. And then therefore will have the opportunity to create something more for themselves. I didn't hear her advocating, you know, a welfare program. Maybe had we kept her on the line, she would have gotten to that point. And obviously we don't think that welfare is the solution because then you're creating more problems. You're creating dependency on the state. And actually it was earlier this week that we talked about the significant numbers of Americans, just Americans across the board that are getting a paycheck from the government. It's something like one out of every two households. Somebody, someone in that household is receiving a check from the federal government. Not even all the state welfare programs and all that. So welfare is a huge problem. Not just for poor people, but just, or blacks. It's just a huge problem across the board. I want to go to Mike, who's on the line listening in Oklahoma. You're on Free Talk Live, Mike, with Ian and Allie and Michelle. Hey, Ian. Welfare is not only a problem for the poor, it's a problem for me. That's why they're getting 33% of my paycheck. I've never filed an income tax, so I'm happy to say in my entire life. That's heroic. Yay! I love that, Mike. Wait a minute. Now you're a professional driver, right? Yes, sir. Now that's interesting that I presume you're working for companies while you're driving, or are you an independent operator? No, I work for a company. I've always worked for a company. I can't seem to make it work to get my own truck. I think that that's not viable in today's market. But I've just never filed. So do they take the money from you? Just to clarify, do they take taxes and you're just not filing, so you're just still losing whatever amount they're taking out in withholding? Yeah, I just don't file. They take out their Social Security, state and federal, and that kind of thing, which is, you know, I'll take that. They can take that. I'm just not going to give them any more, you know? So you don't file. So when you initially are filling out your paperwork with your employer, do you put down several exemptions to minimize what it is that you're having taken from your paycheck each week or month or whatever? I sure do. I'm single with no kids, but I put down that I have three dependents and a wife that doesn't work. So you do file the initial paperwork because it comes from the company. The company requires you to do that, but afterwards you're not filing whatever other paperwork comes through. But they presumably are still sending information to the IRS on you. So have the IRS ever threatened you? Never. And I think that it's because more than likely they would owe me money. I think that's how I've stayed under the radar. That's just my idea on it. How many years have you been doing this? I have never done it. I still got my first job at Dairy Queen when I was in high school at age 14. And you are now how old? I'm 40. Wow, that's great. Nice. Congratulations, by the way. And I think you may, you know, that's a good point. Maybe you would get a refund if you actually filed, which of course is a major reason why people file, you know, is the fact that the government will send them some money back. And so that's a big incentive for people. But the federal government creates this relationship with people, you know, where they're filing and getting money back. And then what happens when you go get out of the rat race and you're actually making some real money that creates actual wealth? You've already had this established relationship with the federal government where you've been paying and filing and what have you. And, you know, you might not be paying now, but you'll be paying then.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.96, "text": " joining you in the studio tonight.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [5549, 291, 294,

you in the studio tonight. It's Ian here. Allie. And Michelle. Let's go right back into your calls here in just a moment. But I know, Allie, you had some further thoughts you wanted to, I guess, express regarding the police and them targeting the government people, targeting minorities. Right. So I think that there's definitely a group of cops and government agents out there that are just simply racists. But I don't think that the disparities that you see in the demographics and incarceration rates is just about racist cops. I think a lot of it has to do with basically racist legislation, like a lot of this legislation that we consider to be, oh, it helps minorities get ahead. Think of the times that a lot of this legislation passed. It wasn't when we had total tolerance of minorities. A lot of it was meant to keep white people from having to compete with minorities as far as labor and jobs went. It's true. And it's been packaged as something that's meant to help these people. And it's really, they call it like knocking out the rings of the economic ladder. So it makes it more difficult for them to catch up. So when you're in poverty, it's much more likely that you're going to be arrested and incarcerated than if you have a steady job, family. So it's not so much a racist thing as it is something that targets poor people. Economic conditions. Right. And not only are you more likely to be arrested if you're poor, but you're also less likely to be able to successfully start your business or your own business because of what you're talking about with these regulations that make it so difficult to open up a business. Maybe it's a zoning regulation. Maybe they just won't let you run businesses out of your home where you live, maybe like a city. There's just zoning that just won't allow that. They'll shut you down for that. Like hair braiding and stuff. I knew some girls that were really good at doing cornrows. I had my hair done. But you can't really, you can't pay for that. You can't pay someone to do that legally. I mean, I think it happens anyway, but you're not supposed to be paying someone to have your, to braid your hair for you. Well, unless they have some sort of a permit, right? Right. Unless they have a permit and a shop and probably a certain number of sinks and all this different stuff. Right. And now you're talking about serious cash. I mean, the average poor person is not going to be able to afford all of that, you know, the renovations that would be required to open up a storefront. But if it's a matter of letting people come into their home and provide them with a service there, that's something that someone who's poor can do. But the fact is these regulations keep them from even getting to that point. Or if they do just go ahead and open up their own place, then all of a sudden they've got men with guns threatening them and telling them, oh, well, you don't have your permission slip. So therefore you either shut down or we take you to jail. It was kind of hard to have dialogue with her because she just kept talking or whatever. But I really wanted to move the conversation away from race to the economic aspect and then get to that, which was why I was getting at the question of her voting. Voting for Obama or not, because really it's a condition of economics and everyone, black, white, you know, has suffered from this economy that is not just the. I wouldn't blame Obama for that. You can't. Right. That was actually the beginning of her call was that, you know, she said you can't blame Obama for the economy. And she's she's right. Many people look to him to fix it, though. Well, that's true, too. And he's not going to fix it. And but he can't be singularly blamed. He and all the politicians that are in there and everybody that came before him are to be blamed. I mean, so George Bush, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, all of these people have been just screwing people left and right. They've been raising taxes, increasing regulations and making it so people can't grow their own businesses and help themselves. And it's just it's been a long time coming. The economy did not just screw up because Obama got elected. It's ridiculous to think that that's true. But it's not getting better because of Obama. It's not. You know, it could certainly get worse because of Obama in the same way that it would have been getting worse had John McCain been elected as well. We'd be experiencing similar problems if John McCain had been elected. Right. I feel privileged to be a white female, which means I'm least likely to ever be incarcerated and that I have the opportunity to actually learn about the way the economy works. And, you know, it doesn't surprise me that these people who are in this desperate situation are just waiting for someone to just tell them that they're willing to do something to help them. You know, if they've been taught their whole lives that government's the answer to the problems of poverty, then, you know, you're not going to hear Mitt Romney going out there saying, oh, yes, we need to help minorities. Well, it's so I don't know if they've been taught that government is the answer to the problem of poverty, but they certainly know that government is the problem. I mean, I think a lot of them are aware that government is standing in the way of them creating their own business. Oh, I don't agree with that at all. Totally disagree. I think it's like a local federal thing. Like as far as the local government goes, they know that they're corrupt because they see those those people all the time coming around and messing around. But maybe they see like the federal government is some kind of savior to like come in and stop the abuse. I don't know. With what do you disagree, Michelle? The idea that this this segment of the population, I'm going to I'm going to say African-American from the South who's unemployed and and has had multiple generations of poverty. I've I lived in Nashville, Tennessee. I also lived in Alabama. And so in those four years, having especially having come out from the West where you can't if if if your eyes are closed, you can't really tell the difference between someone who is black and white when they speak and what have you. When you go to the South, it was it was such a shock for us. And I kept saying, man, these people just don't know that they can walk off the plantation. You know, there was a there was a difference. Black people in general, as if they're from a low socioeconomic class, they defer to white people. Even now, even though they're no longer slaves, they still defer. Everyone's a slave now. I'm talking. You mean the old chattel slavery? Yes. And so. So, yeah, there there is there are behavioral differences between Southern blacks and I don't feel comfortable to put people in groups like that. I don't feel comfortable like that at all. I never got the I never got the sense that they were that like I never saw people from Alabama, by the way. Right. I'm from Alabama. I never. I there's like a there's a level of awkwardness in as far as the differences in race. And if it what it comes from is people being insecure and thinking there's a reason for that, though. And it's all it's all integrated in because the government was the one that, quote unquote, freed people rather than their being the organic process that would have occurred had, you know, Lincoln not interfered. And if because people were already releasing their slaves or had already been a societal change. Now, I'll give you an example. I went to a wedding back in 2006 in Alabama, in Birmingham. And it was, you know, rather wealthy, well-to-do family. There were 600 guests invited as a big wedding. And and the housekeeper who had worked for the family for 30 years and had been kind of like nanny to the two children who are now in their 30s had had raised them, changed their diapers, what have you. I was told this woman is a part of the family. Her name is Myrtle. She was so, you know, so nice. And she was, of course, part of the family. Well, I was trying to buzz around and help with wedding things. You know, I was a guest in their home, but I wasn't part of the wedding party. So I was trying to be helpful. And I asked if they'd like me to go pick up Myrtle to take her to the wedding because I knew she didn't drive. And they said, well, why would Myrtle go to the wedding? I said, what do you mean? Why would Myrtle go to the wedding? And she goes, there aren't going to be any of her people there. This is a college educated woman who said this. Is she white? She's white. Okay. She's white. So so it hadn't even occurred to her. She ended up inviting Myrtle at the last minute to go to the reception. And this gal took her two daughters and was at the reception. And they stuck to themselves the whole time. And when my kids... But that doesn't mean anything about people in the South in general, blacks in the South who are, you know, poor. I don't think it's fair to make these generalizations. Okay. I mean, people are different. I think that it's true. I think it's great that someone else would call in and support what I was talking about because I know I'm right here. We can get to your calls. I mean, I'm sorry. Maybe there's... I think there's truth in the statement that blacks in the South are still being kept down by the man. I think that's true. And that they're being, you know, indoctrinated in government, you know, schools, which is going to lead towards some trends and tendencies. Perpetual poverty. That doesn't mean that there aren't black people in the South who want to start their own businesses and become... My best friend was black. That's not what I said. I did not say that.

Although I think there's definitely evidence that certain poor people are targeted more often than others, specifically blacks and Hispanics, especially if we're talking about being in the South. And although it may be true across the board. But definitely poor people are targeted because they're just easier to run roughshod over. I mean, the rich people can hire lawyers, and lawyers can be tough to deal with if you're the government, the police and all that. I was never sued, though, when I didn't have any money, and I've been sued lots of times since I did. So there is definitely more money and more problems. That's true. But, you know, there's a certain level of poverty where it's like crushing, like, you know, toss me something. No, but I actually had a lawyer say the last time I was in court, this woman is picking on a poor minister. Well, then you're getting sued by another human being, right? You're getting sued by another person. Whereas with the government, people are picking on people. They do tend to pick on poor people, at least for little stuff like, you know, stopping them from having business regulations, stopping them with business regulations from having a business in the first place. Certainly, when you start to get a bunch of money, then the government becomes interested in taking that from you. So, I mean, being rich isn't a way to necessarily solve all your problems, but it is going to lessen the likelihood that you're going to be pulled over on the side of the road and arrested for the possession of a joint. Let's just say that. Whereas poor people, much more likely to be targeted for these things. And then that ruins their lives because, as we talked about earlier, they then get a criminal charge on their record. It becomes then more difficult to get a job, which then makes maybe more likely they're going to be depressed and continue drinking or pick up some other kind of drug habits. It's just a nasty cycle that continues on. And like I said earlier to the caller previously, I wish there was some sort of hope for seeing this stuff change in the future, but I just don't see it happening. I mean, there's actually a news piece in... God, where is it? But she is looking to have her vote count and to march on, I guess, City Hall or the courts in order to effect change. And I don't blame her for thinking that. I mean, a lot of people believe that that's how things are going to have to change, that they're going to have to change the system. And I think it's true. The system's going to have to change unless all of a sudden all of these bureaucrats that work for the police departments are going to wake up and start thinking freedom-oriented and stop enforcing bad laws on people. Until then, you're going to have stories like the one out of Long Beach where the police went into a pot medical cannabis shop and basically beat the occupants and proceeded to destroy equipment in the shop. There's footage of one of the police officers with a club bashing the hell out of a video, a surveillance camera in there, to obscure the rest of the damage that they then proceeded to do after the camera had been destroyed. There was video footage of one of these officers basically crushing a man with his full weight. And these guys weren't violent. They weren't dangerous. They're operating an open marijuana shop in California where this thing should be legal. Why were they raided? They didn't have a permit. So once again, because they might have been poor and they did seem to be black gentlemen that were operating this shop, they had enough wealth to go through the process of opening the shop. But maybe they didn't know enough about the legal land framework to hire a lawyer to make sure that all their T's were crossed and all their I's were dotted as far as whatever legal... Because they were legal by California state law. It was the local ordinance that they didn't have. They didn't have the local permit to occupy that space. So the cops came in and did a raid just like they would do on any illegal marijuana facility. On somebody's business. And somebody is being confiscated from you to hand over to thugs that will go in and steal from your neighbor and destroy your neighbor's property. Right. So they keep using... How do y'all feel about that? It's terrible. And I think that's one of the things that our earlier caller was referring to where she feels frustrated and would like to have some of that relieved. Would like to make it so that her, you know, people she considers her brothers and sisters are not going to be crushed in this way. And then therefore will have the opportunity to create something more for themselves. I didn't hear her advocating, you know, a welfare program. Maybe had we kept her on the line, she would have gotten to that point. And obviously we don't think that welfare is the solution because then you're creating more problems. You're creating dependency on the state. And actually it was earlier this week that we talked about the significant numbers of Americans, just Americans across the board that are getting a paycheck from the government. It's something like one out of every two households. Somebody, someone in that household is receiving a check from the federal government. Not even all the state welfare programs and all that. So welfare is a huge problem. Not just for poor people, but just, or blacks. It's just a huge problem across the board. I want to go to Mike, who's on the line listening in Oklahoma. You're on Free Talk Live, Mike, with Ian and Allie and Michelle. Hey, Ian. Welfare is not only a problem for the poor, it's a problem for me. That's why they're getting 33% of my paycheck. I've never filed an income tax, so I'm happy to say in my entire life. That's heroic. Yay! I love that, Mike. Wait a minute. Now you're a professional driver, right? Yes, sir. Now that's interesting that I presume you're working for companies while you're driving, or are you an independent operator? No, I work for a company. I've always worked for a company. I can't seem to make it work to get my own truck. I think that that's not viable in today's market. But I've just never filed. So do they take the money from you? Just to clarify, do they take taxes and you're just not filing, so you're just still losing whatever amount they're taking out in withholding? Yeah, I just don't file. They take out their Social Security, state and federal, and that kind of thing, which is, you know, I'll take that. They can take that. I'm just not going to give them any more, you know? So you don't file. So when you initially are filling out your paperwork with your employer, do you put down several exemptions to minimize what it is that you're having taken from your paycheck each week or month or whatever? I sure do. I'm single with no kids, but I put down that I have three dependents and a wife that doesn't work. So you do file the initial paperwork because it comes from the company. The company requires you to do that, but afterwards you're not filing whatever other paperwork comes through. But they presumably are still sending information to the IRS on you. So have the IRS ever threatened you? Never. And I think that it's because more than likely they would owe me money. I think that's how I've stayed under the radar. That's just my idea on it. How many years have you been doing this? I have never done it. I still got my first job at Dairy Queen when I was in high school at age 14. And you are now how old? I'm 40. Wow, that's great. Nice. Congratulations, by the way. And I think you may, you know, that's a good point. Maybe you would get a refund if you actually filed, which of course is a major reason why people file, you know, is the fact that the government will send them some money back. And so that's a big incentive for people. But the federal government creates this relationship with people, you know, where they're filing and getting money back. And then what happens when you go get out of the rat race and you're actually making some real money that creates actual wealth? You've already had this established relationship with the federal government where you've been paying and filing and what have you.
