{"text": " So do you think that it's because she's been wearing, you know, the black since season, the beginning of season four, like after Tywin died, like she's been doing it so much that her like clothes getting worn out. Oh, that's depressing. That's really upsetting. But that is the same scene where you see her after that, you know, Frankie Mountain comes in and they're ready to go. You see this, her hands kind of like clasp and you see her big like Lannister ring that she's wearing. And I was like, oh, is this to remind us that, you know, a lion still has claws? Because as much as I think that the Lannisters are falling apart, I'm starting to think that the show is saying not. I think they're saying that they're going to tear shit up and it's crazy. It sounds great to me. And I think, you know, extra textually, if you want to bring in what Lena has said in interviews about Cersei kind of coming back colder hearted and, you know, rage filled like more than ever, then that ties in with your thoughts there. It's nuts. I just, it's so opposite of what I was expecting from them at this point. I mean, because again, we don't really know. Ultimately, as a house, we know that they, they will disintegrate. Probably will disintegrate. But maybe since there are two more seasons after this, maybe they'll like, like explode in a golden, you know, and they have such a nice little sweet king right now. Yeah. Let's talk about the amazing scene between Talman taking his dad, dad, uncle's advice. Uncle father. Yeah. Uncle father to go and ask forgiveness from his mother. Talk about it. The scene with Jamie? No, the scene with Talman and Cersei. Oh my gosh. Yeah. No, that was a lot to process because of the feelings. But, you know, just this idea that he's this, you know, young king who he felt like he couldn't protect his mother or his wife. And, you know, says that thing to her about she raised all her kids to be strong. And he, he felt like he wasn't living up to that and asks her for help. Yeah. I mean, I can't imagine what that felt like for Cersei to hear that stuff. Yeah. You know, it was, it was so incredible. It was such a moving scene and also such an amazing, you know, parallel with Cersei and Joffrey from season one, I believe. And then of course, subsequent Cersei, Joffrey scenes where he's just completely starts because the first scene with, with Cersei and Joffrey, where she's like, everyone who is in us is an enemy, just was such a good moment of counsel where, you know, at that point you're like, oh, Joffrey's like really trying. Like he's, you know, attempting and you kind of believe that he wants to kind of be a better king than his father. Again, Robert, not his father. Yes. But, but here, you know, you have like, and then we all know what Joffrey became and he completely, you know, talk about mad dog. Yeah. Um, but Cersei had Tom in here just ask her for help. And I mean, that's, that's everything she wanted, you know, from, from the kids. Yeah. I mean, it's clear counterpoint to Joffrey. This is an entirely different kid. Yeah. And, and, um, the hug was really amazing. And I liked how she smelled him, you know, like a baby. Um, by the way, this is something I forgot to mention in the Outlander. Um, Claire looks like a really good person to hug. Oh, she like gave such a, like legitimate hug. Like a, Oh, with Mary. Yeah. Well, maybe because she's small. So she like, yeah, I mean, yeah, I really liked how that, um, looked as well. Um, it was just such a genuine, like comforting hug. Yeah. Like, um, you know, it was right. Yeah. She just really wanted to protect her. Yeah. Anyway, Cersei sniffed him in a sweet mother. Yeah. And it was really believable and legit. Um, so that was an amazing moment. And go Cersei. I'm just saying my next note is Ramsey is unpleasant. Wow. Do you really think so? I think he's a ball of sunshine. Which we knew already. Yeah. I thought it was great when he killed his dad. That was a great moment. Unexpected. Totally one of those. I watched Game of Thrones for this, like, what the fuck? This is two episodes in a row. Two episodes in a row. They got rid of characters like that. Um, but again, like this is, you know, part of the themes of this episode where you have these kids like encountering their parents in, in various ways, you know, Bran sees, you know, his young dad, you have Tommen and Cersei and you have like later the Greyjoys and now here you have the Boltons. Yeah. Stuff. Um, so basically he got rid of everyone because his, uh, position as, you know, legitimized bastard was threatened by Walda having a boy. So they're all no more. And he is now in charge in the North there. Good luck to Ramsey. Uh, yeah, I thought that. All right. Just, um, I have to say that I am very sad to see the last remaining amazing voiced man go from this show. You know, we had, we had Charles dance being like, and with the voices and now Ruth, bye. It was, uh, it was pretty rough. And, and I guess it was really unexpected. I mean, it was expected in the sense that I, I guess you expect these things from Ramsey. Which every time I'm like, I hope not, but I have some, the thing about, I feel like the scene with Walda and the baby is you, you almost, and at that point you're like, I hope not. I hope he doesn't. I hope. Yeah. But he's going to do it. And then we just, what does that make us that every time we expect him to change? Partly. I feel like sometimes I just don't want to show it. And they didn't, you get laid some gruesome, like sound effects. The old sound effects. Yeah. I mean, which maybe they didn't even need that. He could have just been like, whatever. What is his line? Shoot. What? Who? He has, he has like a line there when he, before he unleashes, like something about being an only child. I don't know. So I don't know. Oh yeah. That he likes being an only child. Yeah. Something like that. You could have just ended it there. I guess so. I just, there's like, and I, again, I don't have a, my, I have a high limit, uh, for, for stuff. Um, so it's not like I'm super, super bothered, but I do like, I did like check in with my, you know, feelings in the scene. And it, it was kind of like, oh, please don't. I don't want to see that. Um, and again, you don't, but you do hear it. Uh, so this is one of those, those things where, you know, of course this guy would do that. And it's not like out of character. It's not inconsistent. No, it's just sad because it's so in character and, and, and to see him. All right. So what we lost with Bruce is a, a very, very, um, strategic man who I found so fascinating. He was a villain, but a fascinating one because he wasn't crazy. That's the, I just don't like it. I know you don't like them crazy. So a strategist like Bruce, who was right before he was killed, gave such an amazing line. It was such a like Taiwan, like retort where like, you know, he's like, if you have, get a reputation as a mad dog, you're just going to get like, and of course it's thematic, but of course what happened? Out in the back. Yes. Uh, fed to the pigs or whatever the dogs. Um, but this is another thing that happens where there's so many characters and they all have, uh, plots within themselves as well as in with other characters. So for instance, when Sansa came to Winterfell and she, you know, greeted Bruce with a smile and a curtsy, you're like, Oh my God, she's confronting Bruce who she, she knows like killed her family. Yeah. Like when is she going to get her revenge on him? She doesn't because Ramsey takes care of it. I mean, she's gonna like ultimately get revenge on Ramsey, but at the same time, it's like not, not the same. Like, you know, it's, yeah. And again, like, so yeah. So, um, Ramsey took care of him and Karstark, new Karstark Lord, young guy, right. And then also the Umbers and I guess the Manderlys are gonna team up and rule the North under, I mean, under Ramsey, like he's the new warden of the North. Right. So, I mean, this is like a young faction of crazies. Do you think they're making a good choice? No. I mean, Ramsey's clearly like his, his, he's so rash. He doesn't think he's a strategist. He wanted to storm Castle Black. Right. Like, no, I mean, he's, he's not going to be good. He can't, he's, he's going to be done this season. Yeah. There's no way he's going to like last. Can't do this by himself. Yeah, no. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. So Sansa and Brienne. Sansa finds out about Arya. Yeah, it was really sweet. It's wonderful. Beautiful, beautiful little dialogues about how, you know, Brienne's like, she looked good. She didn't, she wasn't dressed like a lady. Yeah. And you had this great reaction from Sansa where she's like, no, she wouldn't. Yeah. And then she stayed moving. She's like, yeah, that's definitely my sister. Um, just really sweet. And then, um, the last scene between Sansa and Theon, which was so sweet and, and good. And she, you know, they've gone through a whole bunch of shit together and she's genuinely upset to see him leave. Yeah. I absolutely loved this relationship. Like I never thought, I never imagined it. Like, obviously you wouldn't from the books. But, um, but the fact that it, it kind of exists now, I'm just like so obsessed with it. And it was really kind of amazing how, you know, she, she genuinely thought he would join the Night's Watch and like be with Jon and all his crimes would be forgiven. And then, nope. Nope. Guess what? He's going episode title, Home. That's right. Finally returned. Two. Oh, princess emojis. The, the Krakens are back. You see Pike, you see the crazy, um, bridge. And of course you get my girl Yara. And, um, all right. I have to say, I can't believe Bailen Greyjoy is the last king of the War of the Five Kings standing. I mean, not for long. He said it. He said it because it's so hilarious. He was like, this is ridiculous. It was really, really funny. That guy is an unsung hero. Um, perfect casting, just like perfect acting. I don't know about like the guy who plays Bailen. Um, he was of course a dick to Yara because, you know, she disobeyed his order, went to try to get Theon, failed at that. And he's like, no one's listening to me and everything sucks. Um, and I thought it was really great to see them fighting because previously, you know, she, she was his fave. And, um, the conflict there was just really rich and he's just like in a bad mood. He's pissy. It's thunderstorming as well. I would be if I lived there. God, it is so rainy. It's real bad. It was interesting that there's in the scene with, with Arya, you could hear thunder in the background. I was like, oh, they're like geographically putting them together, but they're totally geographically on opposite sides of Westeros. Um, so it doesn't really make sense. Um, but yeah, so he, so he's like, this is a really important scene where number one, you kind of are reminded that the Ironborn were kind of doing stuff in season three. They were, they went in, into the mainland and attacked the north because everybody with Rob went south. They took care of the castles there and, um, now they've lost everything again. Yeah. So, um, he's like real pissed, but he's like, we'll just do it again. He goes on this bridge and character introduction in the middle of a thunderstorm. You're on creepy, bridge. Yeah. The most ridiculous bridge, um, ever. So you're on his brother, but really he just so much looks like his son. Cause he looks exactly like Theon. I keep confusing him with all. He's like the two dead sons. I'm like, he's seeing like ghosts. It's crazy. Um, you're on his back and he's like really pompous and all about himself. Isn't he? Cause he's all like, I am the storm brother and other various ridiculous speechifying basically. He shut him off. I was standing on that crazy bridge. I would speechify about to do a murder. Yeah. You would give a speech. Well, it was interesting cause, um, Balon was like out of my way and, and he pulled the knife. So, and he caught him actually. So there's, they're clearly not in a good relationship. Those two guys. Definitely not anymore. Cause he's dead now. Yeah, he's dead. He's squished. Um, in, I can't remember if in the book it's like, I feel like it was, it's a mystery. Like who did it? Or like, this was not a mystery. Or he like fell off by accident. What? But he goes on this bridge all the time. Kind of thing. Here it was like really explicit. Of course. Uh, so this sets up a internal ironborn situation where Yara assumes she's now has the salt throne, AKA as in, you know, king or queen of Pike. Um, because she's his heir. Well, she's not officially there, but she's, she's his fave. Mm hmm. And the, whatever priest is like, uh, no, we're going to have a king's moot. So that, yeah, that was a really, really big thing from the books, but who knows how big of an event it will be. It was so rude. He was such a, just like, you're a lady and see how you fare in the mooting process. Yeah. And you know, I genuinely had a question, like whether if she was a, uh, a boy, like would there even be a question of, of a moot? Gotta look up the king's moot politics. Exactly. Exactly. Um, but she's great. Yeah. It was really great to have her back. Um, selfishly, I really liked her, that her hair was longer because I didn't not like it when she had a short haircut. So she looked great. But that was great. I'm very excited for my cracking thing. And then there were, there were also dragons. They were cool. Um, Tyrion did a thing. I had the dragons. Great. Well, it was, well, we got one. We got one more thing to discuss. Um, yeah, the dragons were cool. Of course. They let them, they let them loose. Cause they hadn't been eating. Yeah, Tyrion was like, we have to set the, the dragons loose. You do feel like that plot is going to be like some time killer with them just hanging out for a while. But as long as Varys is being funny, I'm fine. Yeah. I mean, the duo of Tyrion and Varys is pretty great. Yeah. So that's great. Um, and then the, you know, highlight for many of the episodes of course was Melisandre's confidence boost. She doesn't know it yet though. Yeah, but she will. And that's why I'll allow it because Jon Snow's alive and Melisandre did it as we all suspected that she would. Um, were you happy with how this played out? Was it just not surprising enough? Was it exactly what you wanted and that's, and it was fine? Um, well, I wanted to ask you if, if this is how you imagined it. This would happen. Um, I didn't overly think about it. I just was 100% positive that she was going to bring him back to life. Yeah. And so when it happened, I was like, yes, there it is. I think that I didn't expect what I didn't know was going to be happening was for this intense Melisandre stuff to be going on. I mean, I obviously knew, you know, she was in the shitty place, you know, having all this stuff happen at the end of last season. Um, but so my surprise, I guess, is like, just being more invested in like her being able to say she did the thing and actually the thing having been done. Well, I guess I really loved how you have a very interesting comparison between Mira and, um, Melisandre in the sense that they both seem to be really like without purpose right now. Like Mira was shown kind of sitting outside in the, in the snow outside of the cave, kind of like staring off into the wilderness, you know, beyond the wall. Uh, because her mission was like to get her brother to this cave with Bran. She did it. She did it. Her brother was killed. So she's like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Yeah. She's like, she doesn't know what to do now. She's like completely, basically it's real boring for her because she doesn't get to watch these shows. No, she doesn't get any stories. She does not. Um, so similarly, you again have Melisandre. So sweet. Just so, she's like the little depressed Zoloft ball and she's just sitting by the fire. She's staring at the fire. She's like so upset. Yeah. And so Davos like, you know, uh, pun intended reignites her own flame. Yeah. By being like, yeah, exactly. You can get off your ass and do some more crazy shit. Yeah. So he, um, I do wonder like, does Davos know that they can do resurrection? That's the question. Cause he's like, what if we, what if he doesn't have to, what if John doesn't have to stay dead? I don't know if he knows for a fact that that's a thing that she has seen or that people can do. But I think that him saying that he saw her do all this stuff, it then logically makes sense for me that he could jump to this idea. You know, magic, you know, crazy stuff. Maybe can you do this thing? Um, that makes sense to me. I don't know if he knows of people doing that. Okay. Yeah. Cause I mean, I do love this, you know, the speech that he, that he gave her and it did reinvigorate her to, you know, try it out. Um, she thankfully to us mentioned that she'd seen it done once with Thoreau's. Uh, but at the time that was so amazing because she was so jello of that. Cause she can't, can't do it. You know, she can't even like imagine like, that's not something she even thought she would, would be able to do. And this guy wasn't even trying. He just was like, I'll bring him back. And then, you know, bring my friend back. And then he's back.", "segments": [{"start": 0.04, "end": 0.66, "text": " So do", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [407, 360], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2230165543094758, "compression_ratio":

since season, the beginning of season four, like after Tywin died, like she's been doing it so much that her like clothes getting worn out. Oh, that's depressing. That's really upsetting. But that is the same scene where you see her after that, you know, Frankie Mountain comes in and they're ready to go. You see this, her hands kind of like clasp and you see her big like Lannister ring that she's wearing. And I was like, oh, is this to remind us that, you know, a lion still has claws? Because as much as I think that the Lannisters are falling apart, I'm starting to think that the show is saying not. I think they're saying that they're going to tear shit up and it's crazy. It sounds great to me. And I think, you know, extra textually, if you want to bring in what Lena has said in interviews about Cersei kind of coming back colder hearted and, you know, rage filled like more than ever, then that ties in with your thoughts there. It's nuts. I just, it's so opposite of what I was expecting from them at this point. I mean, because again, we don't really know. Ultimately, as a house, we know that they, they will disintegrate. Probably will disintegrate. But maybe since there are two more seasons after this, maybe they'll like, like explode in a golden, you know, and they have such a nice little sweet king right now. Yeah. Let's talk about the amazing scene between Talman taking his dad, dad, uncle's advice. Uncle father. Yeah. Uncle father to go and ask forgiveness from his mother. Talk about it. The scene with Jamie? No, the scene with Talman and Cersei. Oh my gosh. Yeah. No, that was a lot to process because of the feelings. But, you know, just this idea that he's this, you know, young king who he felt like he couldn't protect his mother or his wife. And, you know, says that thing to her about she raised all her kids to be strong. And he, he felt like he wasn't living up to that and asks her for help. Yeah. I mean, I can't imagine what that felt like for Cersei to hear that stuff. Yeah. You know, it was, it was so incredible. It was such a moving scene and also such an amazing, you know, parallel with Cersei and Joffrey from season one, I believe. And then of course, subsequent Cersei, Joffrey scenes where he's just completely starts because the first scene with, with Cersei and Joffrey, where she's like, everyone who is in us is an enemy, just was such a good moment of counsel where, you know, at that point you're like, oh, Joffrey's like really trying. Like he's, you know, attempting and you kind of believe that he wants to kind of be a better king than his father. Again, Robert, not his father. Yes. But, but here, you know, you have like, and then we all know what Joffrey became and he completely, you know, talk about mad dog. Yeah. Um, but Cersei had Tom in here just ask her for help. And I mean, that's, that's everything she wanted, you know, from, from the kids. Yeah. I mean, it's clear counterpoint to Joffrey. This is an entirely different kid. Yeah. And, and, um, the hug was really amazing. And I liked how she smelled him, you know, like a baby. Um, by the way, this is something I forgot to mention in the Outlander. Um, Claire looks like a really good person to hug. Oh, she like gave such a, like legitimate hug. Like a, Oh, with Mary. Yeah. Well, maybe because she's small. So she like, yeah, I mean, yeah, I really liked how that, um, looked as well. Um, it was just such a genuine, like comforting hug. Yeah. Like, um, you know, it was right. Yeah. She just really wanted to protect her. Yeah. Anyway, Cersei sniffed him in a sweet mother. Yeah. And it was really believable and legit. Um, so that was an amazing moment. And go Cersei. I'm just saying my next note is Ramsey is unpleasant. Wow. Do you really think so? I think he's a ball of sunshine. Which we knew already. Yeah. I thought it was great when he killed his dad. That was a great moment. Unexpected. Totally one of those. I watched Game of Thrones for this, like, what the fuck? This is two episodes in a row. Two episodes in a row. They got rid of characters like that. Um, but again, like this is, you know, part of the themes of this episode where you have these kids like encountering their parents in, in various ways, you know, Bran sees, you know, his young dad, you have Tommen and Cersei and you have like later the Greyjoys and now here you have the Boltons. Yeah. Stuff. Um, so basically he got rid of everyone because his, uh, position as, you know, legitimized bastard was threatened by Walda having a boy. So they're all no more. And he is now in charge in the North there. Good luck to Ramsey. Uh, yeah, I thought that. All right. Just, um, I have to say that I am very sad to see the last remaining amazing voiced man go from this show. You know, we had, we had Charles dance being like, and with the voices and now Ruth, bye. It was, uh, it was pretty rough. And, and I guess it was really unexpected. I mean, it was expected in the sense that I, I guess you expect these things from Ramsey. Which every time I'm like, I hope not, but I have some, the thing about, I feel like the scene with Walda and the baby is you, you almost, and at that point you're like, I hope not. I hope he doesn't. I hope. Yeah. But he's going to do it. And then we just, what does that make us that every time we expect him to change? Partly. I feel like sometimes I just don't want to show it. And they didn't, you get laid some gruesome, like sound effects. The old sound effects. Yeah. I mean, which maybe they didn't even need that. He could have just been like, whatever. What is his line? Shoot. What? Who? He has, he has like a line there when he, before he unleashes, like something about being an only child. I don't know. So I don't know. Oh yeah. That he likes being an only child. Yeah. Something like that. You could have just ended it there. I guess so. I just, there's like, and I, again, I don't have a, my, I have a high limit, uh, for, for stuff. Um, so it's not like I'm super, super bothered, but I do like, I did like check in with my, you know, feelings in the scene. And it, it was kind of like, oh, please don't. I don't want to see that. Um, and again, you don't, but you do hear it. Uh, so this is one of those, those things where, you know, of course this guy would do that. And it's not like out of character. It's not inconsistent. No, it's just sad because it's so in character and, and, and to see him. All right. So what we lost with Bruce is a, a very, very, um, strategic man who I found so fascinating. He was a villain, but a fascinating one because he wasn't crazy. That's the, I just don't like it. I know you don't like them crazy. So a strategist like Bruce, who was right before he was killed, gave such an amazing line. It was such a like Taiwan, like retort where like, you know, he's like, if you have, get a reputation as a mad dog, you're just going to get like, and of course it's thematic, but of course what happened? Out in the back. Yes. Uh, fed to the pigs or whatever the dogs. Um, but this is another thing that happens where there's so many characters and they all have, uh, plots within themselves as well as in with other characters. So for instance, when Sansa came to Winterfell and she, you know, greeted Bruce with a smile and a curtsy, you're like, Oh my God, she's confronting Bruce who she, she knows like killed her family. Yeah. Like when is she going to get her revenge on him? She doesn't because Ramsey takes care of it. I mean, she's gonna like ultimately get revenge on Ramsey, but at the same time, it's like not, not the same. Like, you know, it's, yeah. And again, like, so yeah. So, um, Ramsey took care of him and Karstark, new Karstark Lord, young guy, right. And then also the Umbers and I guess the Manderlys are gonna team up and rule the North under, I mean, under Ramsey, like he's the new warden of the North. Right. So, I mean, this is like a young faction of crazies. Do you think they're making a good choice? No. I mean, Ramsey's clearly like his, his, he's so rash. He doesn't think he's a strategist. He wanted to storm Castle Black. Right. Like, no, I mean, he's, he's not going to be good. He can't, he's, he's going to be done this season. Yeah. There's no way he's going to like last. Can't do this by himself. Yeah, no. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. So Sansa and Brienne. Sansa finds out about Arya. Yeah, it was really sweet. It's wonderful. Beautiful, beautiful little dialogues about how, you know, Brienne's like, she looked good. She didn't, she wasn't dressed like a lady. Yeah. And you had this great reaction from Sansa where she's like, no, she wouldn't. Yeah. And then she stayed moving. She's like, yeah, that's definitely my sister. Um, just really sweet. And then, um, the last scene between Sansa and Theon, which was so sweet and, and good. And she, you know, they've gone through a whole bunch of shit together and she's genuinely upset to see him leave. Yeah. I absolutely loved this relationship. Like I never thought, I never imagined it. Like, obviously you wouldn't from the books. But, um, but the fact that it, it kind of exists now, I'm just like so obsessed with it. And it was really kind of amazing how, you know, she, she genuinely thought he would join the Night's Watch and like be with Jon and all his crimes would be forgiven. And then, nope. Nope. Guess what? He's going episode title, Home. That's right. Finally returned. Two. Oh, princess emojis. The, the Krakens are back. You see Pike, you see the crazy, um, bridge. And of course you get my girl Yara. And, um, all right. I have to say, I can't believe Bailen Greyjoy is the last king of the War of the Five Kings standing. I mean, not for long. He said it. He said it because it's so hilarious. He was like, this is ridiculous. It was really, really funny. That guy is an unsung hero. Um, perfect casting, just like perfect acting. I don't know about like the guy who plays Bailen. Um, he was of course a dick to Yara because, you know, she disobeyed his order, went to try to get Theon, failed at that. And he's like, no one's listening to me and everything sucks. Um, and I thought it was really great to see them fighting because previously, you know, she, she was his fave. And, um, the conflict there was just really rich and he's just like in a bad mood. He's pissy. It's thunderstorming as well. I would be if I lived there. God, it is so rainy. It's real bad. It was interesting that there's in the scene with, with Arya, you could hear thunder in the background. I was like, oh, they're like geographically putting them together, but they're totally geographically on opposite sides of Westeros. Um, so it doesn't really make sense. Um, but yeah, so he, so he's like, this is a really important scene where number one, you kind of are reminded that the Ironborn were kind of doing stuff in season three. They were, they went in, into the mainland and attacked the north because everybody with Rob went south. They took care of the castles there and, um, now they've lost everything again. Yeah. So, um, he's like real pissed, but he's like, we'll just do it again. He goes on this bridge and character introduction in the middle of a thunderstorm. You're on creepy, bridge. Yeah. The most ridiculous bridge, um, ever. So you're on his brother, but really he just so much looks like his son. Cause he looks exactly like Theon. I keep confusing him with all. He's like the two dead sons. I'm like, he's seeing like ghosts. It's crazy. Um, you're on his back and he's like really pompous and all about himself. Isn't he? Cause he's all like, I am the storm brother and other various ridiculous speechifying basically. He shut him off. I was standing on that crazy bridge. I would speechify about to do a murder. Yeah. You would give a speech. Well, it was interesting cause, um, Balon was like out of my way and, and he pulled the knife. So, and he caught him actually. So there's, they're clearly not in a good relationship. Those two guys. Definitely not anymore. Cause he's dead now. Yeah, he's dead. He's squished. Um, in, I can't remember if in the book it's like, I feel like it was, it's a mystery. Like who did it? Or like, this was not a mystery. Or he like fell off by accident. What? But he goes on this bridge all the time. Kind of thing. Here it was like really explicit. Of course. Uh, so this sets up a internal ironborn situation where Yara assumes she's now has the salt throne, AKA as in, you know, king or queen of Pike. Um, because she's his heir. Well, she's not officially there, but she's, she's his fave. Mm hmm. And the, whatever priest is like, uh, no, we're going to have a king's moot. So that, yeah, that was a really, really big thing from the books, but who knows how big of an event it will be. It was so rude. He was such a, just like, you're a lady and see how you fare in the mooting process. Yeah. And you know, I genuinely had a question, like whether if she was a, uh, a boy, like would there even be a question of, of a moot? Gotta look up the king's moot politics. Exactly. Exactly. Um, but she's great. Yeah. It was really great to have her back. Um, selfishly, I really liked her, that her hair was longer because I didn't not like it when she had a short haircut. So she looked great. But that was great. I'm very excited for my cracking thing. And then there were, there were also dragons. They were cool. Um, Tyrion did a thing. I had the dragons. Great. Well, it was, well, we got one. We got one more thing to discuss. Um, yeah, the dragons were cool. Of course. They let them, they let them loose. Cause they hadn't been eating. Yeah, Tyrion was like, we have to set the, the dragons loose. You do feel like that plot is going to be like some time killer with them just hanging out for a while. But as long as Varys is being funny, I'm fine. Yeah. I mean, the duo of Tyrion and Varys is pretty great. Yeah. So that's great. Um, and then the, you know, highlight for many of the episodes of course was Melisandre's confidence boost. She doesn't know it yet though. Yeah, but she will. And that's why I'll allow it because Jon Snow's alive and Melisandre did it as we all suspected that she would. Um, were you happy with how this played out? Was it just not surprising enough? Was it exactly what you wanted and that's, and it was fine? Um, well, I wanted to ask you if, if this is how you imagined it. This would happen. Um, I didn't overly think about it. I just was 100% positive that she was going to bring him back to life. Yeah. And so when it happened, I was like, yes, there it is. I think that I didn't expect what I didn't know was going to be happening was for this intense Melisandre stuff to be going on. I mean, I obviously knew, you know, she was in the shitty place, you know, having all this stuff happen at the end of last season. Um, but so my surprise, I guess, is like, just being more invested in like her being able to say she did the thing and actually the thing having been done. Well, I guess I really loved how you have a very interesting comparison between Mira and, um, Melisandre in the sense that they both seem to be really like without purpose right now. Like Mira was shown kind of sitting outside in the, in the snow outside of the cave, kind of like staring off into the wilderness, you know, beyond the wall. Uh, because her mission was like to get her brother to this cave with Bran. She did it. She did it. Her brother was killed. So she's like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Yeah. She's like, she doesn't know what to do now. She's like completely, basically it's real boring for her because she doesn't get to watch these shows. No, she doesn't get any stories. She does not. Um, so similarly, you again have Melisandre. So sweet. Just so, she's like the little depressed Zoloft ball and she's just sitting by the fire. She's staring at the fire. She's like so upset. Yeah. And so Davos like, you know, uh, pun intended reignites her own flame. Yeah. By being like, yeah, exactly. You can get off your ass and do some more crazy shit. Yeah. So he, um, I do wonder like, does Davos know that they can do resurrection? That's the question. Cause he's like, what if we, what if he doesn't have to, what if John doesn't have to stay dead? I don't know if he knows for a fact that that's a thing that she has seen or that people can do. But I think that him saying that he saw her do all this stuff, it then logically makes sense for me that he could jump to this idea. You know, magic, you know, crazy stuff. Maybe can you do this thing? Um, that makes sense to me. I don't know if he knows of people doing that. Okay. Yeah. Cause I mean, I do love this, you know, the speech that he, that he gave her and it did reinvigorate her to, you know, try it out. Um, she thankfully to us mentioned that she'd seen it done once with Thoreau's. Uh, but at the time that was so amazing because she was so jello of that. Cause she can't, can't do it. You know, she can't even like imagine like, that's not something she even thought she would, would be able to do. And this guy wasn't even trying. He just was like, I'll bring him back. And then, you know, bring my friend back. And then he's back.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.04, "end": 6.08, "text": " So do you think that it's because she's been wearing, you know, the black since season,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens":
