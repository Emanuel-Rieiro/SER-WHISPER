{"text": " To me, it seems like she's trying to propagate her own specialty group. Like, she's pandering to women here by saying, like, women's rights. But what about all the other minority groups' rights? She just completely fails to mention all of that. Yeah, why should she care about... She does mention it at one point. She should care about Filipinos' rights. And what about, you know, you can think of any minority, midgets. You know, they're so exploited by the state. Well, I just don't happen to look up midget issues. I just never thought to. Should we refocus our libertarian outreach efforts on midgets? I mean, so... But I think one of the reasons why women are talked about as a deficiency in the liberty movement is because it's an obvious one. But also as obvious are the lack of other so-called minorities, like blacks or Hispanics within the liberty movement as well. Well, they're not a minority in every day-to-day life. So I guess the reason why it's brought up more so than minorities is that, you know, if there is about a 50-50 divide in men and women in the U.S., but then you look at libertarians in the U.S. and you see a disparity, then you're wondering why it appeals to these groups, you know, this demographic more so than the other, why it's not relating the same. Personally, I think a lot of it is chicken or the egg. And maybe you struck on this earlier when you were talking about, well, what happened when it was created, the libertarian movement? Was it a bunch of guys who got together to create this thing? I think Sharon Harris was involved back in the day from Advocates for Self-Government. And she's the president of the Advocates for Self-Government. I believe she was one of the originals behind the Libertarian Party. I could be mistaken on that. But maybe you're right. You know, maybe it's just been something that's just always propagated because it was started by a bunch of white single males that it's just kind of always attracted those kinds of people. And we're seeing it expand out now, especially here in New Hampshire with the Free State Project, seeing a much greater variety as far as men and women. But even still, not so much in the way of blacks and Hispanics. Is there something that could be done about that? Question I have, what can be done to bring more women into the movement? Or is it just something that will have to solve itself over time as more women get involved and start doing outreach on these issues of importance? It's Free Talk Live. Share your thoughts.

We've been in deep in this issue of women in the liberty movement with one lady at Thoughts on Liberty. Her website, ThoughtsOnLiberty.com, it is an all-female liberty blog site. And first, I've actually heard of it, so I'm definitely going to have to add it to my aggregator and see what other things they're talking about over there. Because I share some of her concerns. I may not necessarily be on board with all of it, but I definitely share some of her concerns about the lack of women in the movement and the question of why is it? What are the reasons that there's this great disparity between men and women in the liberty movement? We'd love to get your thoughts at 855-450-FREE.

Hey. Hey, you're on here. I've been listening. Yes. I've been listening up and on. It's been kind of sporadic because of the weather here. But with an address that is female ego, it keeps the women out of the movement. Tell me what you mean by that. The female ego. Oh, well, heaven forbid, you might be prettier than I am. Or you weigh less than I do. Therefore, I don't like you. Therefore, I'm not going to back anything that you say. What do you ladies think? This sounds to me like the old idea that women just can't get along. And I... You got it, baby. In my life, it's been true. I mean, I wish it weren't true. But in my life, the women that I've known have not been friendly towards other women in general. And you're saying, Blue, that that's what you believe is the case. But why would that keep them out of the liberty movement? Like, I don't know why... Well, because my opinion is more important than your opinion. But because I think that my opinion is more important than your opinion, I'm going to crush your opinion so you can't even be part of the discussion. They're too egocentric, you mean? I haven't been there. They're intellectual cowards? Is that what you're claiming? I think what she's saying is that women are more judgmental towards each other, especially... Towards each other? I mean, then that would be like, why wouldn't women gravitate towards the liberty movement? Because there's not as many women to disagree with you. Right? Like, why would you join the Democratic Party if there's all these... Sorry, Blue, go ahead. Because they're absolutely judgmental. It is ridiculous. I have worked at jobs. I'm a very small, very petite female. And I have been discriminated against because I was so small. By other women? By other women. How are you discriminated against? We never eat. Oh, really? Right. So you're saying women get jealous of each other really easily? See, I don't know why that would... I don't know why... Sorry, Colleen. I haven't seen this. That's all right. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been in the liberty movement. I helped... You know, I was so blessed to be there when Stuart Rhodes gave the first oath to the civilian population. Sorry? Who's Stuart Rhodes? You don't know who Stuart Rhodes is? No. Oath keepers. Oh, okay. Okay. Gotcha. The oath keepers. Yeah, yeah. Definitely heard about them on these airwaves. So you've experienced discrimination from other women and it has been a turnoff for you? Yes, but, you know, I still continue to fight on the liberty movement. Right. But a lot of this has to do with the way that you raise your daughters. You know, I was blessed enough to be in a situation that my father taught me that whatever the boys can do, you can do better rather than being a whine girl. And so I have always looked at my life in that perspective. Blue, I want to thank you for your call and the perspective that you've shared tonight. Appreciate hearing from you at 855-450-FREE. What do you ladies think? I mean, it's not a secret to anybody who's ever looked at the webcam. You guys are both as attractive as you are intelligent. Thanks. And that could be an intimidating factor, I think, for some people. Certainly for men, it can be an intimidating factor. I see what she was saying about how women can compare each other. And sometimes women give like this really... Like, I don't even... I don't know how it relates to the liberty movement, but, you know, yeah, like you'll definitely... Older women interacting with me, I think because I'm younger and there's... I don't know. I think it's societal pressure for like women. Once you reach a certain age, it's like people... Women seem to think that they're being thrown away because they're not hot anymore or something. I think that that's all in people's heads, really. But, you know, maybe some men do give off that vibe that it's the point of being a woman is to look young. And I do get an angry vibe, like judgmental vibe from older women. But that doesn't really have anything to do with the liberty movement in my mind. I don't know why that would keep women out because there's not a... It's not like we're a bunch of judgmental women here in the liberty movement. Yeah, you make a really good point. Like, women definitely are more judgmental towards each other when it comes to physical appearances. Like, does my hair look as good? Am I, you know, as physically attractive in other ways? And if the answer is no, then you're going to behave towards this other woman in kind of a nasty way. And that's just the experience that I've had with most females. They're very antagonistic to other women that they see as a threat. But I don't see how that would apply to the liberty movement, especially as compared to any other situation. I feel like it's more incentive for women to get involved when... Yeah, because there's not so many here. Right. What's the threat anyways? I mean, what are you, a threat to take away the throngs of socially awkward libertarian males? Essentially, Ed, I guess... I mean, it doesn't seem like a lot of the libertarian males in this movement are really worth fighting over. I don't know. I mean, it's the attention that they want, basically. I don't really know how... Yeah, I mean, I don't see... I feel like because there aren't as many women here that, you know, to me, that would create like a vacuum which would suck more women in because, you know, if you are women... Say you're a woman who likes male attention. There are women like that out there. And, you know, if you want to find a place for it, the liberty movement's a good one. If you enjoy a sausage fest, this is the place. If you don't know anything about liberty and you're just doing it for the attention, then, you know, I think that people will see through that, too. So there seems to be a kind of a dichotomy here, perhaps, where on one hand, at least through the discussion we've had so far, where on one hand, you've got this idea that, well, more women should bring more women into the movement. But on the other hand, what Blue's suggesting here is that women don't get along. And so having more women is a good one. But Blue's not necessarily going to bring more women into the movement. I mean, is there even an answer? Or is it just something that we can't even... Like, it doesn't seem like there's any possible... Like, with those two differing positions, there's no reconciling that. Well, I feel like if you're the kind of woman that is outspoken and intelligent and knowledgeable on these subjects and you want to get involved in the liberty movement, you're not going to feel threatened or want to, you know, insult these other women that are around you. So you're going to want to come. I don't think that, you know, this is an issue that people can solve. It's just one that will resolve itself over time. Maybe it's just a natural filtering mechanism that the best, most... the right ladies for the movement will be the ones that come into it. Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen. I think over time, more women are going to see that there's not as many women here and migrate over. I don't think it's a problem that we should be worrying and scheming over. Should I not have had a ladies panel at the convention then? I don't think there's anything wrong with promoting the women, but I don't think it's an issue.

You can Skype into the show at username LRN.FM. Tonight in the studio, it's Ian. Allie. And Ellen. Let's go to the phones and actually go to Skype first, where Phillip is on the line from Michigan. Phillip, you're on Free Talk Live. Hey, guys. I was just calling to follow up about a story that I've called in a few times about, and that involves an open carry case for talking firearms and a district library in Michigan. I'm not sure if you remember or not, but in the past, I've told you about how this district library is publicly owned, was trying to ban firearms in the library, saying that people couldn't bring firearms in the library. Well, over the past three years, the case has worked its way up to the state Supreme Court. We won at the Court of Appeals, we being Michigan Open Carry. And yesterday, the Supreme Court of Michigan declined to hear the case, which means the Court of Appeals ruling stand. Meaning you won. And it means that we won and the libraries are preempted. So, you know, a broken clock does strike twice, strike quite right twice a day. Congratulations, Phillip. Now, what did this cost you, Michigan Open Carry? I mean, did you have to hire an attorney for this or did somebody provide pro bono services? Well, you know, we have a lawyer who's been very generous to us. Although, you know, he has expenses too. You know, suffice to say, the library outspent us about six to one, five or six to one, and they spent $125,000 in loss. Oh, my God. So you spent about $20,000, that was what you're saying? Yeah. And I live in the county of the libraries. So I actually paid twice because they used my taxpayer dollars to fight the case. So it's hard to really quantify that as a win. I mean, yes, you didn't lose the court case, but you're out $20,000 and you're patting the attorney on the back and, you know, acting like he did you a favor. Sounds to me like he made out pretty good on this deal. Well, you know, if you consider the average expense to get to a case like this. To take it to the Supreme Court? It's $100,000. If he's better off with the attorney, then the attorney did do him a favor. It just happens to be a racket. But this is, yeah, right. Racket's the exact word here. Because if you think about this, this is how ridiculous this system is. All they had to do was make some stupid policy that said, well, no more guns allowed in the library. And then you spent $20,000 just to make it so, and years of time, just to make it so that policy goes away. So now you're back at where you were, what, when did this start? Five years ago? Three years? How long was it? Late 2010. So three years. It's taken three whole years for this thing to shake out, which in court time is actually relatively quickly. But $20,000 just because they made some unconstitutional policy. All those bureaucrats had to do was sit around in some board meeting and say, we're just going to make a new policy here. They write it down. They sign it. It goes into effect. Finally, somebody gets arrested over it or somebody gets upset about it. They decide to challenge it. In this case, it was Michigan Open Carry. And now some attorney ends up making buku bucks. Their attorneys made a bunch of money. The Constitution hasn't been changed. It's still what it always was. You won the case, but you lost $20,000 in the process. I mean, it's hard to really call this a win. It's hard to get excited about it. All you have to do is make another stupid law, and then you're going to shell out another $30,000 to overturn that. Or in this case, a policy. Well, you know, Los Angeles Spooner was right on the Constitution, I do believe. What do you mean? That it was too small to, or excuse me, that either the Constitution authorized the tyranny we have or was powerless to prevent it? Exactly. So, I mean, congratulations are in order. You did win the case, but at the same time, it was a very great cost. You guys have it, Michigan Open Carry, but I can tell you that most of the organizations I'm involved in don't have $20,000 to float on an attorney. Well, it's a cost, but I think it might be, you might see it as valuable in that at least you don't have to worry that if there is, you know, if you're preventing some crazy gunman from going to the library and shooting people. We know that when you have gun-free zones that it just kind of invites that behavior. If you feel like the $20,000 was well spent to prevent something like that for people's security or whatever your, you know, goals in doing this might be, then, you know, you're successful. Right, and I think Ian makes a good point, though, that you wouldn't have to spend this money and waste your time fighting this if they didn't make the laws in the first place. And from my understanding, you said it's a public library. Like, why are they making these laws if that's not what the public wants?", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 3.6, "text": " To me, it seems like she's trying to propagate her own specialty group.",

{"text": " To me, it seems like she's trying to propagate her own specialty group. Like, she's pandering to women here by saying, like, women's rights. But what about all the other minority groups' rights? She just completely fails to mention all of that. Yeah, why should she care about... She does mention it at one point. She should care about Filipinos' rights. And what about, you know, you can think of any minority, midgets. You know, they're so exploited by the state. Well, I just don't happen to look up midget issues. I just never thought to. Should we refocus our libertarian outreach efforts on midgets? I mean, so... But I think one of the reasons why women are talked about as a deficiency in the liberty movement is because it's an obvious one. But also as obvious are the lack of other so-called minorities, like blacks or Hispanics within the liberty movement as well. Well, they're not a minority in every day-to-day life. So I guess the reason why it's brought up more so than minorities is that, you know, if there is about a 50-50 divide in men and women in the U.S., but then you look at libertarians in the U.S. and you see a disparity, then you're wondering why it appeals to these groups, you know, this demographic more so than the other, why it's not relating the same. Personally, I think a lot of it is chicken or the egg. And maybe you struck on this earlier when you were talking about, well, what happened when it was created, the libertarian movement? Was it a bunch of guys who got together to create this thing? I think Sharon Harris was involved back in the day from Advocates for Self-Government. And she's the president of the Advocates for Self-Government. I believe she was one of the originals behind the Libertarian Party. I could be mistaken on that. But maybe you're right. You know, maybe it's just been something that's just always propagated because it was started by a bunch of white single males that it's just kind of always attracted those kinds of people. And we're seeing it expand out now, especially here in New Hampshire with the Free State Project, seeing a much greater variety as far as men and women. But even still, not so much in the way of blacks and Hispanics. Is there something that could be done about that? Question I have, what can be done to bring more women into the movement? Or is it just something that will have to solve itself over time as more women get involved and start doing outreach on these issues of importance? It's Free Talk Live. Share your thoughts.

We've been in deep in this issue of women in the liberty movement with one lady at Thoughts on Liberty. Her website, ThoughtsOnLiberty.com, it is an all-female liberty blog site. And first, I've actually heard of it, so I'm definitely going to have to add it to my aggregator and see what other things they're talking about over there. Because I share some of her concerns. I may not necessarily be on board with all of it, but I definitely share some of her concerns about the lack of women in the movement and the question of why is it? What are the reasons that there's this great disparity between men and women in the liberty movement? We'd love to get your thoughts at 855-450-FREE. And you can join Free Talk Live and BuzzBox Coffee and make a difference one day. One cup at a time.

Give microloans to people who can then start their own coffee plantation. So, coffee.freetalklive.com. Go there. We go to the phones. Blue is in Knoxville, Tennessee, listening to WKVL. Hello, Blue. Hey. Hey, you're on here. I've been listening. Yes. I've been listening up and on. It's been kind of sporadic because of the weather here. But with an address that is female ego, it keeps the women out of the movement. Tell me what you mean by that. The female ego. Oh, well, heaven forbid, you might be prettier than I am. Or you weigh less than I do. Therefore, I don't like you. Therefore, I'm not going to back anything that you say. What do you ladies think? This sounds to me like the old idea that women just can't get along. And I... You got it, baby. In my life, it's been true. I mean, I wish it weren't true. But in my life, the women that I've known have not been friendly towards other women in general. And you're saying, Blue, that that's what you believe is the case. But why would that keep them out of the liberty movement? Like, I don't know why... Well, because my opinion is more important than your opinion. But because I think that my opinion is more important than your opinion, I'm going to crush your opinion so you can't even be part of the discussion. They're too egocentric, you mean? I haven't been there. They're intellectual cowards? Is that what you're claiming? I think what she's saying is that women are more judgmental towards each other, especially... Towards each other? I mean, then that would be like, why wouldn't women gravitate towards the liberty movement? Because there's not as many women to disagree with you. Right? Like, why would you join the Democratic Party if there's all these... Sorry, Blue, go ahead. Because they're absolutely judgmental. It is ridiculous. I have worked at jobs. I'm a very small, very petite female. And I have been discriminated against because I was so small. By other women? By other women. How are you discriminated against? We never eat. Oh, really? Right. So you're saying women get jealous of each other really easily? See, I don't know why that would... I don't know why... Sorry, Colleen. I haven't seen this. That's all right. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been in the liberty movement. I helped... You know, I was so blessed to be there when Stuart Rhodes gave the first oath to the civilian population. Sorry? Who's Stuart Rhodes? You don't know who Stuart Rhodes is? No. Oath keepers. Oh, okay. Okay. Gotcha. The oath keepers. Yeah, yeah. Definitely heard about them on these airwaves. So you've experienced discrimination from other women and it has been a turnoff for you? Yes, but, you know, I still continue to fight on the liberty movement. Right. But a lot of this has to do with the way that you raise your daughters. You know, I was blessed enough to be in a situation that my father taught me that whatever the boys can do, you can do better rather than being a whine girl. And so I have always looked at my life in that perspective. Blue, I want to thank you for your call and the perspective that you've shared tonight. Appreciate hearing from you at 855-450-FREE. What do you ladies think? I mean, it's not a secret to anybody who's ever looked at the webcam. You guys are both as attractive as you are intelligent. Thanks. And that could be an intimidating factor, I think, for some people. Certainly for men, it can be an intimidating factor. I see what she was saying about how women can compare each other. And sometimes women give like this really... Like, I don't even... I don't know how it relates to the liberty movement, but, you know, yeah, like you'll definitely... Older women interacting with me, I think because I'm younger and there's... I don't know. I think it's societal pressure for like women. Once you reach a certain age, it's like people... Women seem to think that they're being thrown away because they're not hot anymore or something. I think that that's all in people's heads, really. But, you know, maybe some men do give off that vibe that it's the point of being a woman is to look young. And I do get an angry vibe, like judgmental vibe from older women. But that doesn't really have anything to do with the liberty movement in my mind. I don't know why that would keep women out because there's not a... It's not like we're a bunch of judgmental women here in the liberty movement. Yeah, you make a really good point. Like, women definitely are more judgmental towards each other when it comes to physical appearances. Like, does my hair look as good? Am I, you know, as physically attractive in other ways? And if the answer is no, then you're going to behave towards this other woman in kind of a nasty way. And that's just the experience that I've had with most females. They're very antagonistic to other women that they see as a threat. But I don't see how that would apply to the liberty movement, especially as compared to any other situation. I feel like it's more incentive for women to get involved when... Yeah, because there's not so many here. Right. What's the threat anyways? I mean, what are you, a threat to take away the throngs of socially awkward libertarian males? Essentially, Ed, I guess... I mean, it doesn't seem like a lot of the libertarian males in this movement are really worth fighting over. I don't know. I mean, it's the attention that they want, basically. I don't really know how... Yeah, I mean, I don't see... I feel like because there aren't as many women here that, you know, to me, that would create like a vacuum which would suck more women in because, you know, if you are women... Say you're a woman who likes male attention. There are women like that out there. And, you know, if you want to find a place for it, the liberty movement's a good one. If you enjoy a sausage fest, this is the place. If you don't know anything about liberty and you're just doing it for the attention, then, you know, I think that people will see through that, too. So there seems to be a kind of a dichotomy here, perhaps, where on one hand, at least through the discussion we've had so far, where on one hand, you've got this idea that, well, more women should bring more women into the movement. But on the other hand, what Blue's suggesting here is that women don't get along. And so having more women is a good one. But Blue's not necessarily going to bring more women into the movement. I mean, is there even an answer? Or is it just something that we can't even... Like, it doesn't seem like there's any possible... Like, with those two differing positions, there's no reconciling that. Well, I feel like if you're the kind of woman that is outspoken and intelligent and knowledgeable on these subjects and you want to get involved in the liberty movement, you're not going to feel threatened or want to, you know, insult these other women that are around you. So you're going to want to come. I don't think that, you know, this is an issue that people can solve. It's just one that will resolve itself over time. Maybe it's just a natural filtering mechanism that the best, most... the right ladies for the movement will be the ones that come into it. Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen. I think over time, more women are going to see that there's not as many women here and migrate over. I don't think it's a problem that we should be worrying and scheming over. Should I not have had a ladies panel at the convention then? I don't think there's anything wrong with promoting the women, but I don't think it's an issue. Okay, we'll come back with more here in moments. You can bring up anything as we go into our number three, Charles Manson's getting married, apparently. Ellen's going to tell us about that.

You can Skype into the show at username LRN.FM. Tonight in the studio, it's Ian. Allie. And Ellen. Let's go to the phones and actually go to Skype first, where Phillip is on the line from Michigan. Phillip, you're on Free Talk Live. Hey, guys. I was just calling to follow up about a story that I've called in a few times about, and that involves an open carry case for talking firearms and a district library in Michigan. I'm not sure if you remember or not, but in the past, I've told you about how this district library is publicly owned, was trying to ban firearms in the library, saying that people couldn't bring firearms in the library. Well, over the past three years, the case has worked its way up to the state Supreme Court. We won at the Court of Appeals, we being Michigan Open Carry. And yesterday, the Supreme Court of Michigan declined to hear the case, which means the Court of Appeals ruling stand. Meaning you won. And it means that we won and the libraries are preempted. So, you know, a broken clock does strike twice, strike quite right twice a day. Congratulations, Phillip. Now, what did this cost you, Michigan Open Carry? I mean, did you have to hire an attorney for this or did somebody provide pro bono services? Well, you know, we have a lawyer who's been very generous to us. Although, you know, he has expenses too. You know, suffice to say, the library outspent us about six to one, five or six to one, and they spent $125,000 in loss. Oh, my God. So you spent about $20,000, that was what you're saying? Yeah. And I live in the county of the libraries. So I actually paid twice because they used my taxpayer dollars to fight the case. So it's hard to really quantify that as a win. I mean, yes, you didn't lose the court case, but you're out $20,000 and you're patting the attorney on the back and, you know, acting like he did you a favor. Sounds to me like he made out pretty good on this deal. Well, you know, if you consider the average expense to get to a case like this. To take it to the Supreme Court? It's $100,000. If he's better off with the attorney, then the attorney did do him a favor. It just happens to be a racket. But this is, yeah, right. Racket's the exact word here. Because if you think about this, this is how ridiculous this system is. All they had to do was make some stupid policy that said, well, no more guns allowed in the library. And then you spent $20,000 just to make it so, and years of time, just to make it so that policy goes away. So now you're back at where you were, what, when did this start? Five years ago? Three years? How long was it? Late 2010. So three years. It's taken three whole years for this thing to shake out, which in court time is actually relatively quickly. But $20,000 just because they made some unconstitutional policy. All those bureaucrats had to do was sit around in some board meeting and say, we're just going to make a new policy here. They write it down. They sign it. It goes into effect. Finally, somebody gets arrested over it or somebody gets upset about it. They decide to challenge it. In this case, it was Michigan Open Carry. And now some attorney ends up making buku bucks. Their attorneys made a bunch of money. The Constitution hasn't been changed. It's still what it always was. You won the case, but you lost $20,000 in the process. I mean, it's hard to really call this a win. It's hard to get excited about it. All you have to do is make another stupid law, and then you're going to shell out another $30,000 to overturn that. Or in this case, a policy. Well, you know, Los Angeles Spooner was right on the Constitution, I do believe. What do you mean? That it was too small to, or excuse me, that either the Constitution authorized the tyranny we have or was powerless to prevent it? Exactly. So, I mean, congratulations are in order. You did win the case, but at the same time, it was a very great cost. You guys have it, Michigan Open Carry, but I can tell you that most of the organizations I'm involved in don't have $20,000 to float on an attorney. Well, it's a cost, but I think it might be, you might see it as valuable in that at least you don't have to worry that if there is, you know, if you're preventing some crazy gunman from going to the library and shooting people. We know that when you have gun-free zones that it just kind of invites that behavior. If you feel like the $20,000 was well spent to prevent something like that for people's security or whatever your, you know, goals in doing this might be, then, you know, you're successful. Right, and I think Ian makes a good point, though, that you wouldn't have to spend this money and waste your time fighting this if they didn't make the laws in the first place. And from my understanding, you said it's a public library. Like, why are they making these laws if that's not what the public wants?", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.6, "text": " To me, it seems like she's trying to propagate her own specialty
