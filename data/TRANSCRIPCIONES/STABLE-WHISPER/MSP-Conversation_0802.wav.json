{"text": " I consider this pretty strong speculation based on all the other information that's out there. Mm-hmm. But it would appear that there's a really good shot of a mixed tag with Cena and Nikki versus Miz and Maryse. And. No, I don't want that. It's not that I don't want a mixed tag. I love a mixed tag. But that's. But of course, Daniel Bryan, again, as we've said, I don't want him to come back. Right. If he's going to put his health at risk. But that should be his and Brie's spot. Or it should be. Which of course Brie can't do it either. Exactly. Or it should be Renee's secretly training down in NXT and it's her and Ambrose's spot. Yeah. Yeah. But from this perspective, I look at it as you've got Undertaker is going to be in a big match. He's a part-timer. With Roman Reigns. Most likely, yes. Yes. You've got Goldberg and Lesnar who are both part-timers who are going to be in a marquee match. You've got most likely Shaquille O'Neal. Who is not a wrestler. No. Versus The Big Show who is probably pretty much a part-timer at this point. In a marquee match. You've most likely got Shane McMahon in a match of some type. Again, because he's around and that's what they do. A part-timer in another marquee match. You've got. See, I thought they would go Shane Miz. That's where I'm really getting confused. See, that would have been a possibility. Yeah. You've got, depending on how recent injury situations unfold, most likely Triple H in a match of some type. Another part-timer in a marquee match. So, people are going to get left out of what they are due as far as mania moments are concerned in this mania. I mean, it's not rare this happens, but it seems like it's going to be happening to a bunch of people who really, really, really deserve better after the year that they've been in. They've just had. Yeah. My fear is that Ambrose is going to be one of those people. I figure it's another throw the Intercontinental Championship from scoreboard. Yeah. I mean, if that's what we get, then so be it. And then what styles do it? Exactly. Exactly. AJ has been the stalwart of the SmackDown brand for the last several months. Has basically carried the show and has done a really good job. I mean, yes. By every metric that they have to measure these things by, he's done excellent. Styles, Miz, and Ambrose have been the three that have carried the show. Yes. When people have been out hurt or people have just been off. Yes. Those three have been there consistently. Yeah. Yeah. And at least one and maybe all of them will end up with the short end of the stick at WrestleMania. WrestleMania based on what's out there. Again, it's all speculation. Yeah, because Styles could easily win the title back at Elimination Chamber. Yes. And then you have Randy and Styles and you involve Bray in that somehow. Yeah. But I just, I think of all the potential things that we could have had coming out of Rumble and what we ended up with was Randy Orton winning the Rumble. What we ended up with was us sitting here knowing that there were going to be eight surprise names and we knew, you know, that doesn't mean there's going to be eight surprises. Yeah. There's going to be Kalisto. Yeah. And there's going to be Apollo Crews and Luke Harper. And there should be. I like it better. There absolutely should be. But there's eight surprises and we get to number 30 and we know there's a surprise left and that surprise ends up being Roman Reigns. And it's just one of those slap your forehead moments. You heard the air practically being sucked out of the building. Yes. 50 plus thousand people. The most widely attended WrestleMania since the last time they were in the Alamo Dome. Royal Rumble. Or Royal Rumble, excuse me. And I think probably a bigger crowd than that one. Yeah, because they had a, I don't know if they gave away tickets or not, but they had a pretty full crowd. They were showing. If they gave away tickets, they probably didn't have to give as many away as the last time they did Rumble in that building. They were showing really high up in that building. Yeah. So that means they were pretty proud of their crowd. Right. But all of those people just immediately like, okay, they did it again and it's, it's not going to work. And the other thing is that it's not going to end. They're going to, Vince is going to keep pushing Roman Reigns. It's going to happen. You're never going to accept it. That's clear. I'll probably grow. No, I will probably grow to accept it at some point in time, especially if they put him back with Dean and Seth. But if, I mean, if a shield reunion is, is in the works at some point, that's the only possibility that they have of salvaging some, some positive feedback for the guy. I think unless, and this is the problem. If they turn him heel and they make it a clear heel turn, he'll probably start getting cheered some. Oh, he's a heel right now. He came out unexpected number 30 at the Rumble and took out the Undertaker. He is a huge heel. And not just that he eliminated the Undertaker, but did you see the look on his face when he's staring down at the Undertaker on the floor and telling him, this is my yard now. Give me a, give me a break. He's an excellent heel. And maybe that's, maybe that's our fault. Maybe. All of us just start thinking of him as a heel and go with it. He wins the champion. He's a heel champion. Just. Yeah. Until he comes out, you know, smiling and cracking suck, suck a task jokes. And we just still figure he's a heel. Maybe we just need to change our perspective. It's certainly going to be easier than changing that one. So. I guess, but it's, it just seems. Look at the world in a different way. It seems very, very unlikely. That. Wrestling fans are going to change the way they think about something, especially the ones that, that think they know a lot about wrestling. Yeah. You know, our, myself included. I mean that, but that being said, if you, if you look at the Rumble match itself, it was, it was still the most engaging Rumble match in a while. And. Because, and, and if there's a positive to Reigns being number 30, it's that, is that I had sat through the entire Rumble match and it had, it had left the back of my mind that Reigns might actually be in it. Yeah. I just, I just, I decided that there's no way he was going to be in it. So I went through up until 30, that whole match thinking, okay, there's no chance of Reigns winning this. It doesn't mean they're going to pick the right person in my mind, but at least it won't be Reigns. Anybody, anyone but you, Roman. Um, and so, so basically I'm sitting through the whole thing wondering, okay, who are the eight, who are the eight going to be? Um, so like when, when Jack Gallagher's music hits, you're like, that was a delightful surprise. Like that's really refreshing. It's, it's cool. It was, it was a cool moment. Um, and you know, he's going to get in for a little bit and, and have his time and have a spot or two and then he's gone. And really they gave him longer than I thought they would. Yeah. They really let him go with it. Yeah. And it, and it worked really well. Um, you get close to the number 10 entry and you're thinking, okay, this is the perfect opportunity for them to generate some goodwill for themselves. Cause you got a lot of fans who've been practically begging for Ty Dillinger to get this opportunity. And lo and behold, he gets it. And not only did he get the opportunity, but he got to get in the ring and, and showcase himself for a little while. And, and, you know, actually be a good part of the match for him. For a bit. So, uh, kudos to the, kudos to them for that. I have zero problem really with anybody who was in the rumble deserving to be in the rumble. Yeah. Which it's kind of nice because I like the throwback surprises. Right. But then it's nice to see guys that have, that have traveled to middle of nowhere, North Dakota or wherever doing house shows on the weekend, get the payoff of being in the rumble. So yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, so it's, it's one of those years where, uh, we didn't really get any of those nostalgia, nostalgia pop entries. Was there a single, I mean, Mark Henry, was he the closest thing? Yeah, I guess. Um, but I mean, it's Mark Henry. He's not gonna, he's not gonna move the needle really. Um, so I, but I was just meaning, it's probably about as close as we get. I mean, you pretty much knew that, uh, you pretty much knew that you knew the big show was going to be in it. So that wasn't a big surprise. Well, big show had announced that he was going to be in it. Had he announced that? Yeah. I didn't know if he had done it or not. Um, so really, I guess the surprises were, cause Kalisto had not, they had not announced Kalisto. So he was kind of a surprise. Uh, Ty Dillinger, Jack Gallagher, Cruz, uh, Apollo Cruz, James Ellsworth. Yeah. Uh, whatever. Um, and was there, oh, Enzo. Yeah. Which I hate to say was, was another kind of let down really because, uh, I mean, they, they tried to create a little moment there and, and even the live crowd wasn't buying it at that point. He came in at number 27, um, which I, I think what they were thinking was, um, and, and I, I'm probably overthinking it, but 27 is one of those numbers that a lot of winners have come from. Yeah. So maybe they were, so they're thinking, are, are, are they thinking, you know, we've got some fans that are sitting there thinking that's, that a potential winner is getting ready to come out. Let's send Enzo out there and have everybody but Brock be down to where Enzo's got to throw himself at Brock and, and get demolished. And that's exactly what happened. Um, so, you know, it, it was what it was.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.28, "text": " I consider this pretty strong speculation based on all the other information that's out there.", "seek":

" I consider this pretty strong speculation based on all the other information that's out there. Mm-hmm. But it would appear that there's a really good shot of a mixed tag with Cena and Nikki versus Miz and Maryse. And. No, I don't want that. It's not that I don't want a mixed tag. I love a mixed tag. But that's. But of course, Daniel Bryan, again, as we've said, I don't want him to come back. Right. If he's going to put his health at risk. But that should be his and Brie's spot. Or it should be. Which of course Brie can't do it either. Exactly. Or it should be Renee's secretly training down in NXT and it's her and Ambrose's spot. Yeah. Yeah. But from this perspective, I look at it as you've got Undertaker is going to be in a big match. He's a part-timer. With Roman Reigns. Most likely, yes. Yes. You've got Goldberg and Lesnar who are both part-timers who are going to be in a marquee match. You've got most likely Shaquille O'Neal. Who is not a wrestler. No. Versus The Big Show who is probably pretty much a part-timer at this point. In a marquee match. You've most likely got Shane McMahon in a match of some type. Again, because he's around and that's what they do. A part-timer in another marquee match. You've got. See, I thought they would go Shane Miz. That's where I'm really getting confused. See, that would have been a possibility. Yeah. You've got, depending on how recent injury situations unfold, most likely Triple H in a match of some type. Another part-timer in a marquee match. So, people are going to get left out of what they are due as far as mania moments are concerned in this mania. I mean, it's not rare this happens, but it seems like it's going to be happening to a bunch of people who really, really, really deserve better after the year that they've been in. They've just had. Yeah. My fear is that Ambrose is going to be one of those people. I figure it's another throw the Intercontinental Championship from scoreboard. Yeah. I mean, if that's what we get, then so be it. And then what styles do it? Exactly. Exactly. AJ has been the stalwart of the SmackDown brand for the last several months. Has basically carried the show and has done a really good job. I mean, yes. By every metric that they have to measure these things by, he's done excellent. Styles, Miz, and Ambrose have been the three that have carried the show. Yes. When people have been out hurt or people have just been off. Yes. Those three have been there consistently. Yeah. Yeah. And at least one and maybe all of them will end up with the short end of the stick at WrestleMania. WrestleMania based on what's out there. Again, it's all speculation. Yeah, because Styles could easily win the title back at Elimination Chamber. Yes. And then you have Randy and Styles and you involve Bray in that somehow. Yeah. But I just, I think of all the potential things that we could have had coming out of Rumble and what we ended up with was Randy Orton winning the Rumble. What we ended up with was us sitting here knowing that there were going to be eight surprise names and we knew, you know, that doesn't mean there's going to be eight surprises. Yeah. There's going to be Kalisto. Yeah. And there's going to be Apollo Crews and Luke Harper. And there should be. I like it better. There absolutely should be. But there's eight surprises and we get to number 30 and we know there's a surprise left and that surprise ends up being Roman Reigns. And it's just one of those slap your forehead moments. You heard the air practically being sucked out of the building. Yes. 50 plus thousand people. The most widely attended WrestleMania since the last time they were in the Alamo Dome. Royal Rumble. Or Royal Rumble, excuse me. And I think probably a bigger crowd than that one. Yeah, because they had a, I don't know if they gave away tickets or not, but they had a pretty full crowd. They were showing. If they gave away tickets, they probably didn't have to give as many away as the last time they did Rumble in that building. They were showing really high up in that building. Yeah. So that means they were pretty proud of their crowd. Right. But all of those people just immediately like, okay, they did it again and it's, it's not going to work. And the other thing is that it's not going to end. They're going to, Vince is going to keep pushing Roman Reigns. It's going to happen. You're never going to accept it. That's clear. I'll probably grow. No, I will probably grow to accept it at some point in time, especially if they put him back with Dean and Seth. But if, I mean, if a shield reunion is, is in the works at some point, that's the only possibility that they have of salvaging some, some positive feedback for the guy. I think unless, and this is the problem. If they turn him heel and they make it a clear heel turn, he'll probably start getting cheered some. Oh, he's a heel right now. He came out unexpected number 30 at the Rumble and took out the Undertaker. He is a huge heel. And not just that he eliminated the Undertaker, but did you see the look on his face when he's staring down at the Undertaker on the floor and telling him, this is my yard now. Give me a, give me a break. He's an excellent heel. And maybe that's, maybe that's our fault. Maybe. All of us just start thinking of him as a heel and go with it. He wins the champion. He's a heel champion. Just. Yeah. Until he comes out, you know, smiling and cracking suck, suck a task jokes. And we just still figure he's a heel. Maybe we just need to change our perspective. It's certainly going to be easier than changing that one. So. I guess, but it's, it just seems. Look at the world in a different way. It seems very, very unlikely. That. Wrestling fans are going to change the way they think about something, especially the ones that, that think they know a lot about wrestling. Yeah. You know, our, myself included. I mean that, but that being said, if you, if you look at the Rumble match itself, it was, it was still the most engaging Rumble match in a while. And. Because, and, and if there's a positive to Reigns being number 30, it's that, is that I had sat through the entire Rumble match and it had, it had left the back of my mind that Reigns might actually be in it. Yeah. I just, I just, I decided that there's no way he was going to be in it. So I went through up until 30, that whole match thinking, okay, there's no chance of Reigns winning this. It doesn't mean they're going to pick the right person in my mind, but at least it won't be Reigns. Anybody, anyone but you, Roman. Um, and so, so basically I'm sitting through the whole thing wondering, okay, who are the eight, who are the eight going to be? Um, so like when, when Jack Gallagher's music hits, you're like, that was a delightful surprise. Like that's really refreshing. It's, it's cool. It was, it was a cool moment. Um, and you know, he's going to get in for a little bit and, and have his time and have a spot or two and then he's gone. And really they gave him longer than I thought they would. Yeah. They really let him go with it. Yeah. And it, and it worked really well. Um, you get close to the number 10 entry and you're thinking, okay, this is the perfect opportunity for them to generate some goodwill for themselves. Cause you got a lot of fans who've been practically begging for Ty Dillinger to get this opportunity. And lo and behold, he gets it. And not only did he get the opportunity, but he got to get in the ring and, and showcase himself for a little while. And, and, you know, actually be a good part of the match for him. For a bit. So, uh, kudos to the, kudos to them for that. I have zero problem really with anybody who was in the rumble deserving to be in the rumble. Yeah. Which it's kind of nice because I like the throwback surprises. Right. But then it's nice to see guys that have, that have traveled to middle of nowhere, North Dakota or wherever doing house shows on the weekend, get the payoff of being in the rumble. So yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, so it's, it's one of those years where, uh, we didn't really get any of those nostalgia, nostalgia pop entries. Was there a single, I mean, Mark Henry, was he the closest thing? Yeah, I guess. Um, but I mean, it's Mark Henry. He's not gonna, he's not gonna move the needle really. Um, so I, but I was just meaning, it's probably about as close as we get. I mean, you pretty much knew that, uh, you pretty much knew that you knew the big show was going to be in it. So that wasn't a big surprise. Well, big show had announced that he was going to be in it. Had he announced that? Yeah. I didn't know if he had done it or not. Um, so really, I guess the surprises were, cause Kalisto had not, they had not announced Kalisto. So he was kind of a surprise. Uh, Ty Dillinger, Jack Gallagher, Cruz, uh, Apollo Cruz, James Ellsworth. Yeah. Uh, whatever. Um, and was there, oh, Enzo. Yeah. Which I hate to say was, was another kind of let down really because, uh, I mean, they, they tried to create a little moment there and, and even the live crowd wasn't buying it at that point. He came in at number 27, um, which I, I think what they were thinking was, um, and, and I, I'm probably overthinking it, but 27 is one of those numbers that a lot of winners have come from. Yeah. So maybe they were, so they're thinking, are, are, are they thinking, you know, we've got some fans that are sitting there thinking that's, that a potential winner is getting ready to come out. Let's send Enzo out there and have everybody but Brock be down to where Enzo's got to throw himself at Brock and, and get demolished. And that's exactly what happened.
