{"text": " Welcome to Maggie's Running Podcast. I'm Maggie Cooper and I'm joined by my husband, Peter. Yes, hello. Well, it's not been a great week in terms of running. In fact, it's not been a great week anyway, but running-wise or not running-wise, it's not been good. Because I was full of hope. At the end of last week, I was really full of hope. Because I had, in fact, I did since the last podcast, I have done quite a few things. Now, the best thing was the Pilates. You missed the Pilates because you were entertaining children instead, weren't you? I have done Pilates. Years ago, I worked as a library assistant. Of course, you'd obviously do Pilates in the library. The entire staff, at my suggestion, because I thought it would be funny, did Pilates in the mornings before starting work. I think that's a jolly good idea. Maybe we should get that at every workplace. I'd have to go in at half past six or something to start to do that, though. I think there's something in it. I think it's a good idea. But no, it was excellent, actually. It was very, very good because my friend came round. In fact, Penny has done lessons and stuff for other people before. She hasn't done it for one. She's done it since she moved up here. And so Anne and I were going to have a lesson off of her, but then Anne couldn't make it. And so it ended up just being me. And it was just brilliant. Like one-to-one Pilates class with somebody who's just a really, really great instructor. So she gave me lots of exercise to do. But I have to say, I've hardly done anything because it's just been just one of those weeks. For example, Daniel had to go on a school trip. Was that yesterday or the day before? Yesterday. Yesterday. Yeah, and so he's half an hour late back. So that means I missed the time when I could have done, when I would normally do my exercise. And the whole week's been like that. So it's been really, really difficult to get anything done. But at least it's going to be a really good idea about different things. I'm particularly strengthening the core. I think that's the essential thing. The core and the glutes, you know, are really going to help towards getting a better running style and to prevent injury and just to be more stable. I think, you know, you think about when you put your foot down on the ground, you're standing on one leg, aren't you, essentially, for some period of time. So if you're not stable, if you can't actually stand on one leg, how are you really able to run? Well, you're not just standing on one leg. You're standing on one leg and then jumping off from it. Yeah, exactly. Good stability and that comes through the core and the glutes and, you know, the whole sort of body set. It's not just to do with the legs. So, yeah, I'm excited about trying to do some more of that. But I think, you know, like we've discussed before, it's just fitting these things in is really difficult. So we did the Pilates for, I guess, more than an hour, hour and a half maybe. It was quite a long time. To dedicate that amount of time, maybe once a week I could dedicate something like that. But it's really, really difficult. So I think that you have to choose a few key exercises and do those well. Just like the thing with the pose technique and the things that Anne's teaching me. Again, I've not done them as religiously as I did the previous week. But I have, what I've tried to do is if I've had a spare moment, like I discussed about standing by the photocopy, I waited for the photocopy to warm up the other week. You know, that is a good time to actually do some. So, you know, I've been stood in the kitchen and standing on one leg or doing hip extensions or, you know, lunges or something like that or calf raises or whatever. It's quite, you know, you've just got to think. Just fit it into your day whenever you can. So I've been really aware of that. And I've also been really aware about, you know, my walking and holding my posture and keeping the, you know, the core nice and tightened. Just, you know, just walking down really better. And also, the other thing I discovered not that it's that exciting, but it's about the shoes. So when I first had that plantar fasciitis, you know, I've got the UFAs. And the UFAs, they're like crocs. So they're sort of plastic shoe things. But they had a little bit more arch support. And I have to say, they were really, really fantastic when I first got the plantar fasciitis. You know, really, really helped and take away the pain and you could walk without pain wearing those. But what I think is if you wear them all the time, it doesn't really help. You get any better. In fact, I think it can even make it worse again. You need, I think after a while, you have to switch back to more barefoot and flat shoes, which is what I found last time I had plantar fasciitis. I found that those were the things where it worked fine. So I've got two different pairs of running shoes. And one day, it must have been this week. I was thinking I haven't done any running, but it must have been this week. I wore them to work. And then I have to walk from my car. I walked to the gym. And then I, because I didn't want to have like loads of pairs of shoes, I just wore the shoes that I was going to run in on the treadmill. So then I did running on the treadmill. And then I walked back to the hospital. And then at the end of the day, I walked back another mile back to the school. So I did a couple of miles walking and a couple of miles running in these shoes. And I was basically in them all day. And by the end of the day, my foot really hurt again. And they, and they, they're really nice shoes. And they've got really, it's kind of arch support type thing. And, you know, on the face of it, they seem really, really comfy. But wearing them all day was, was, you know, really hurt my foot. Then I got another pair of shoes, which is the shoes, which I really, most of my running in and my training for when I ran the marathon in September last year. And, you know, so, so I've got two, two pair, two pairs of shoes, exactly the same. So then I wore them instead. And they're much flatter and they don't have any sort of support inside. They're really not completely a minimalist shoe, but they're very pretty thin. And walking around in those and wearing them, wearing those all day, my foot hasn't hurt. So I think that it's, I think there's, is there something in having some sort of arch support or some, you know, some cushioning when you first have the plantar fasciitis. But as it goes on, I think you need to be able to strengthen your foot and get the foot working in order to, you know, get, get rid of it. So anyway, it's, it's useful for me because I discovered that I don't wear those shoes for a long period of time where, where the, where the flatter ones. So that was a good, that was a good thing to know. Yeah. So what about yourself? Anything happening? Anything to me? Yeah. Any running? Well, I've been doing my running in the morning. But what I think is, you know, you're talking about time. I think it'd be better to do a shorter amount of time in the morning. Because there's other things I want to do early in the morning. And then, but do some other running later. Yeah. I mean, I really wanted to get up at, like five, actually, when I say I really wanted to get up at 5.15. That is not actually true. But I really wanted to run early in the morning. And I was going to get up at 5.15. But this week, as I say, it's been pretty dreadful because the, on the Saturday, we got some flat packed furniture delivered. Yes, we did. And they said the delivery was going to be between 7 and 11. So I thought, well, I'm gonna have to get up before 7, which is really quite early for me on Saturday morning, I would have normally laid in. And I was always quite tired, but then I had to get up. And it did arrive, it arrived really quite soon after seven, didn't it? So it was a good job that I got up. But, and then another day, I didn't sleep very well. And another day, somebody sent me a text message at about five o'clock in the morning, and that woke me up. Just the ping. And normally I sleep through the, those things, but because it was that time of day near to when I was going to get up. So then, you know, so it's just gone on. And I've just been tired. So I haven't then said, oh, well, I'm going to get up early. But I think I need to do that. I think that's the only way I'm really going to get it done reliably. Because when my real time, which I have planned for running is really bring the kids home from school, maybe just grab a quick drink, and then go to the gym or go running before I make the tea. But if that's delayed at all, then I can't do it because the kids are going, I'm hungry, I'm hungry. So you just can't get anything done. So these are the problems of family life. Oh, to be single again. What? Child free, perhaps. So what is the long term plan then? Well, that's a good question. Because I have entered and been accepted for the London Marathon. Because I entered on a good for age time. So I ran that marathon in September last year. And you know, I was I was very ill going into that in the buildup of that. And I had completely had to change my plan for the race. And even on the day before I was discussing with my mom, I would come up with to Nottingham with me, I just I said, I just don't know what to do. I don't know what pace to run at. And in the end, we sort of talked it through and decided to maybe stick with a guy who was doing 345 because I thought that was a manageable pace based on the pace that I had been running in the training runs. And that's what I did. And I stuck with him, like glue, poor man. Actually, I lost I did lose it. I don't remember if I regaled the story that the marathon that marathon but I was with him at the beginning. And then he stopped for a toilet break. And then he I didn't see him again. And then I had to stop for a toilet break. And then I came out of the toilet, I can see this flag in distance, I wasn't sure whether it was him or not. And so I caught up with him about about seven miles, and then around the next 10 miles with them. But then after that, and one of the guys who was in that group sort of broke away, and I sort of followed him. So I ended up finishing in 344. And I think that 345 was the good for age time. So I got in good for age time. And I and, you know, as long as you can prove that you've got that good for age, and you get a guaranteed entry. So I'm entered for the London Marathon. So that's my long term. That's, that's what I'm really aiming for. Okay, I'm really interested in doing the cross country over the winter. And I really, really want to do well in that. But the I guess the goal after that is to run the London Marathon, because it'd be nice to get well, it'd be nice to get closer to three hours again, I did, I really think it's not feasible, not unless, not unless running technique really improves my speed. I don't think I can get under three hours. You've tried various techniques over the years. So stay tuned for us. I mean, see what the strategy used is. But I think this thing, you know, I say about the diet as well. I'm also interested to see whether that helps, because if I can teach my body to burn fat, rather than carbohydrate, then I think I might be in a better position come 2024, 25 miles and not lose all that energy. So we'll see. Yeah, that's, that's the plan. This week, my plan is to actually do some running, and maybe to do some Pilates and some of the other exercises that Anne's given me to do. So yeah, it should be should be fun anyway. Looking forward to it. Anyway, that's all for this week. And hopefully you'll tune in again next week to see how we've got on.

I'm Maggie Cooper and I'm joined by my husband, Peter. Yes, hello. Well, it's not been a great week in terms of running. In fact, it's not been a great week anyway, but running-wise or not running-wise, it's not been good. Because I was full of hope. At the end of last week, I was really full of hope. Because I had, in fact, I did since the last podcast, I have done quite a few things. Now, the best thing was the Pilates. You missed the Pilates because you were entertaining children instead, weren't you? I have done Pilates. Years ago, I worked as a library assistant. Of course, you'd obviously do Pilates in the library. The entire staff, at my suggestion, because I thought it would be funny, did Pilates in the mornings before starting work. I think that's a jolly good idea. Maybe we should get that at every workplace. I'd have to go in at half past six or something to start to do that, though. I think there's something in it. I think it's a good idea. But no, it was excellent, actually. It was very, very good because my friend came round. In fact, Penny has done lessons and stuff for other people before. She hasn't done it for one. She's done it since she moved up here. And so Anne and I were going to have a lesson off of her, but then Anne couldn't make it. And so it ended up just being me. And it was just brilliant. Like one-to-one Pilates class with somebody who's just a really, really great instructor. So she gave me lots of exercise to do. But I have to say, I've hardly done anything because it's just been just one of those weeks. For example, Daniel had to go on a school trip. Was that yesterday or the day before? Yesterday. Yesterday. Yeah, and so he's half an hour late back. So that means I missed the time when I could have done, when I would normally do my exercise. And the whole week's been like that. So it's been really, really difficult to get anything done. But at least it's going to be a really good idea about different things. I'm particularly strengthening the core. I think that's the essential thing. The core and the glutes, you know, are really going to help towards getting a better running style and to prevent injury and just to be more stable. I think, you know, you think about when you put your foot down on the ground, you're standing on one leg, aren't you, essentially, for some period of time. So if you're not stable, if you can't actually stand on one leg, how are you really able to run? Well, you're not just standing on one leg. You're standing on one leg and then jumping off from it. Yeah, exactly. Good stability and that comes through the core and the glutes and, you know, the whole sort of body set. It's not just to do with the legs. So, yeah, I'm excited about trying to do some more of that. But I think, you know, like we've discussed before, it's just fitting these things in is really difficult. So we did the Pilates for, I guess, more than an hour, hour and a half maybe. It was quite a long time. To dedicate that amount of time, maybe once a week I could dedicate something like that. But it's really, really difficult. So I think that you have to choose a few key exercises and do those well. Just like the thing with the pose technique and the things that Anne's teaching me. Again, I've not done them as religiously as I did the previous week. But I have, what I've tried to do is if I've had a spare moment, like I discussed about standing by the photocopy, I waited for the photocopy to warm up the other week. You know, that is a good time to actually do some. So, you know, I've been stood in the kitchen and standing on one leg or doing hip extensions or, you know, lunges or something like that or calf raises or whatever. It's quite, you know, you've just got to think. Just fit it into your day whenever you can. So I've been really aware of that. And I've also been really aware about, you know, my walking and holding my posture and keeping the, you know, the core nice and tightened. Just, you know, just walking down really better. And also, the other thing I discovered not that it's that exciting, but it's about the shoes. So when I first had that plantar fasciitis, you know, I've got the UFAs. And the UFAs, they're like crocs. So they're sort of plastic shoe things. But they had a little bit more arch support. And I have to say, they were really, really fantastic when I first got the plantar fasciitis. You know, really, really helped and take away the pain and you could walk without pain wearing those. But what I think is if you wear them all the time, it doesn't really help. You get any better. In fact, I think it can even make it worse again. You need, I think after a while, you have to switch back to more barefoot and flat shoes, which is what I found last time I had plantar fasciitis. I found that those were the things where it worked fine. So I've got two different pairs of running shoes. And one day, it must have been this week. I was thinking I haven't done any running, but it must have been this week. I wore them to work. And then I have to walk from my car. I walked to the gym. And then I, because I didn't want to have like loads of pairs of shoes, I just wore the shoes that I was going to run in on the treadmill. So then I did running on the treadmill. And then I walked back to the hospital. And then at the end of the day, I walked back another mile back to the school. So I did a couple of miles walking and a couple of miles running in these shoes. And I was basically in them all day. And by the end of the day, my foot really hurt again. And they, and they, they're really nice shoes. And they've got really, it's kind of arch support type thing. And, you know, on the face of it, they seem really, really comfy. But wearing them all day was, was, you know, really hurt my foot. Then I got another pair of shoes, which is the shoes, which I really, most of my running in and my training for when I ran the marathon in September last year. And, you know, so, so I've got two, two pair, two pairs of shoes, exactly the same. So then I wore them instead. And they're much flatter and they don't have any sort of support inside. They're really not completely a minimalist shoe, but they're very pretty thin. And walking around in those and wearing them, wearing those all day, my foot hasn't hurt. So I think that it's, I think there's, is there something in having some sort of arch support or some, you know, some cushioning when you first have the plantar fasciitis. But as it goes on, I think you need to be able to strengthen your foot and get the foot working in order to, you know, get, get rid of it. So anyway, it's, it's useful for me because I discovered that I don't wear those shoes for a long period of time where, where the, where the flatter ones. So that was a good, that was a good thing to know. Yeah. So what about yourself? Anything happening? Anything to me? Yeah. Any running? Well, I've been doing my running in the morning. But what I think is, you know, you're talking about time. I think it'd be better to do a shorter amount of time in the morning. Because there's other things I want to do early in the morning. And then, but do some other running later. Yeah. I mean, I really wanted to get up at, like five, actually, when I say I really wanted to get up at 5.15. That is not actually true. But I really wanted to run early in the morning. And I was going to get up at 5.15. But this week, as I say, it's been pretty dreadful because the, on the Saturday, we got some flat packed furniture delivered. Yes, we did. And they said the delivery was going to be between 7 and 11. So I thought, well, I'm gonna have to get up before 7, which is really quite early for me on Saturday morning, I would have normally laid in. And I was always quite tired, but then I had to get up. And it did arrive, it arrived really quite soon after seven, didn't it? So it was a good job that I got up. But, and then another day, I didn't sleep very well. And another day, somebody sent me a text message at about five o'clock in the morning, and that woke me up. Just the ping. And normally I sleep through the, those things, but because it was that time of day near to when I was going to get up. So then, you know, so it's just gone on. And I've just been tired. So I haven't then said, oh, well, I'm going to get up early. But I think I need to do that. I think that's the only way I'm really going to get it done reliably. Because when my real time, which I have planned for running is really bring the kids home from school, maybe just grab a quick drink, and then go to the gym or go running before I make the tea. But if that's delayed at all, then I can't do it because the kids are going, I'm hungry, I'm hungry. So you just can't get anything done. So these are the problems of family life. Oh, to be single again. What? Child free, perhaps. So what is the long term plan then? Well, that's a good question. Because I have entered and been accepted for the London Marathon. Because I entered on a good for age time. So I ran that marathon in September last year. And you know, I was I was very ill going into that in the buildup of that. And I had completely had to change my plan for the race. And even on the day before I was discussing with my mom, I would come up with to Nottingham with me, I just I said, I just don't know what to do. I don't know what pace to run at. And in the end, we sort of talked it through and decided to maybe stick with a guy who was doing 345 because I thought that was a manageable pace based on the pace that I had been running in the training runs. And that's what I did. And I stuck with him, like glue, poor man. Actually, I lost I did lose it. I don't remember if I regaled the story that the marathon that marathon but I was with him at the beginning. And then he stopped for a toilet break. And then he I didn't see him again. And then I had to stop for a toilet break. And then I came out of the toilet, I can see this flag in distance, I wasn't sure whether it was him or not. And so I caught up with him about about seven miles, and then around the next 10 miles with them. But then after that, and one of the guys who was in that group sort of broke away, and I sort of followed him. So I ended up finishing in 344. And I think that 345 was the good for age time. So I got in good for age time. And I and, you know, as long as you can prove that you've got that good for age, and you get a guaranteed entry. So I'm entered for the London Marathon. So that's my long term. That's, that's what I'm really aiming for. Okay, I'm really interested in doing the cross country over the winter. And I really, really want to do well in that. But the I guess the goal after that is to run the London Marathon, because it'd be nice to get well, it'd be nice to get closer to three hours again, I did, I really think it's not feasible, not unless, not unless running technique really improves my speed. I don't think I can get under three hours. You've tried various techniques over the years. So stay tuned for us. I mean, see what the strategy used is. But I think this thing, you know, I say about the diet as well. I'm also interested to see whether that helps, because if I can teach my body to burn fat, rather than carbohydrate, then I think I might be in a better position come 2024, 25 miles and not lose all that energy. So we'll see. Yeah, that's, that's the plan. This week, my plan is to actually do some running, and maybe to do some Pilates and some of the other exercises that Anne's given me to do. So yeah, it should be should be fun anyway. Looking forward to it. Anyway, that's all for this week. And hopefully you'll tune in again next week to see how we've got on.
