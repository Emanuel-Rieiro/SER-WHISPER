{"text": " Hello, welcome to Girl Uninterrupted where we discuss topics and issues that affect women and female identifying people. As you know, I am Lisa and we have guests today. First up, we have Dre, who is my friend and the founder of Girl Uninterrupted. Hey, Dre. Hey. Tell the people something about yourself. Hey, so everyone, my name is Dre. As Lisa just said, you know, she's one of my bestest friends. She's actually one of my bites mates at my wedding. And she kept me sane for most of the wedding and then she left me to go get drunk. That's okay. That's okay. Because we both got drunk. That was a good thing. Yeah, I mean, it was the whole point. Reception. Yeah, you know, we had to. We had to do that. That was your duty. That was my duty. But yeah, so I work here in Miami-Dade County. I work in a nonprofit for advocating for affordable housing and issues surrounding homelessness. So that's what I do. And so a little background on Girl Uninterrupted. Many moons ago, it was a dark night. Oh. Just kidding. So my best friend and I, we were sitting at this conference called Women Who Lead at FIU. And we were seeing all these amazing women who were talking about all these different issues. You know, one of them was Ndege Green from WLRN. And I remember looking at her. She is an inspiration. She is someone who, you know, is this amazing person. So we were like, okay, what can we do? I mean, they started out just like us. You know, they were just two kids in college, two, you know, whatever. So we decided, let's talk shit. You know, we do this all the time anyway. We might as well. You know, we were part of like various feminist clubs, various things on campus. Evelyn was part of the student radio there. And we decided, let's do a podcast. So we originally called it Miami Girl. And, you know, we had some fun with it. Lisa was actually on the show a couple times. And we decided, okay, let's continue doing this. This is really fun. And we were talking about issues that many Miami women and femmes were facing, right? Many women did not have this platform to talk and air out concerns, right? So we decided, let's continue with this. And then we saw that Miami Girl was already a name that was taken by, you know, not taken, but, you know, that was already being used by different organizations. So we decided, let's call it something else. We decided to call it Girl Uninterrupted. That's how this whole thing started. And then we got closer. I, you know, we were talking more and more. She is amazing. One, she knows the community and she can speak on all these issues. But also, she's very good at asking, you know, important questions that can really get people talking and thinking. And I think this is the best place for all of that. But yeah. I like it. Thank you, Dre. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to do all of this. I do not give it to you. You took it. Oh, my gosh. Anyway, more importantly, we have the girls of Sleepless in Miami. Yay! Janie and Rujie, please introduce yourselves. Hello, everybody. So I'm Janie. And I'm Rujie. The second host. Yes. We're co-hosts. And you explain the background. So Sleepless in Miami was born. When did we start? It's going to be about a year ago, shortly after we moved in together. Yeah. Yeah. Janie and I, we've been friends for years and years. And we quickly became best friends in the last, like, what, two years? Yeah. And I just remember her, while I was at work, always texting me, like, different questions that she herself was wondering. It's like, hey, what do you think about, you know, like, promise rings? Necessarily going on in our lives. They were just, like, hypotheticals. Like, let's just discuss. And we realized quickly that we could have, like, endless conversations about this. And there were so many good points to bring out. Because we're very different people. Like, I'm much more of an emotional, like, type of impulsive, impatient person. And she's very much more of a, let me methodically think this out, logically. You know, so we're very different in our opinion. So we thought, if we can have these super long conversations, about things, and it's shit sometimes. It really is. Yeah, we should talk all the time. But we thought that there has to be somebody out there that wants to listen to this and wants to be a part of it. And through the process, we've discovered that a lot of our listeners tell us, like, we'll be hearing you guys. And we're yelling in the car, our opinions, like, over you. Because we can hear you guys, like, going back and forth. And we feel like we're part of your podcast. Because it's such a conversational space. And, you know, relatable type of topics. Especially for young women in our age, in our millennial group. They want to come and kind of talk about the same things that they see on their social media all the time. Like, again, people buying houses. And people moving in together. And, like, having babies at a young age. And it's all of these topics that we're, like, we talk about anyways at our house. And we might as well just share it with the world and see what can come out of it. So, and a lot of it, too, it first starts out as shit talking. And then it slowly started becoming topics where it's like, wait a minute. This can actually help someone else. You know, like, this health issue is happening to me. Maybe it's happening to somebody else. And maybe they feel alone. So, let's share it. And something good will come out of it. And that's really our main goal after it. Like, at first it's just something fun, a hobby. And then maybe it can become something great. Yeah, that's what normally happens. Because that's how I came into Girl and Interrupted as well. Like, oh, let me do this to vent. Or let me do this to just talk about issues that I've dealt with. But it turned into this whole different thing. So, thank you so much for sharing the story. Because it's a great show. So, I'm happy that you guys are here. So, let's kick things off with Women of the Week. Last week was the Oscars. And there were so many amazing women who won. Like, Lady Gaga, Olivia Colman. She's ridiculous. Yeah, that performance was crazy. Ruth E. Carter for designing Black Panther. All the clothes, the costumes. But I'm going to have to give my Woman of the Week to Regina King. Who won Best Supporting Actress for If Beale Street Could Talk. Although, I don't think that amazing actors like Black actors like Regina King and so many others get the validation that they need at the Oscars. Or get as many awards that they should. But this time they did. And I'm really, really, really happy. Because she deserves it. And it's nice to see a woman who has been in the entertainment business for forever finally get her flowers. She's been in so many staple Black films and TV shows. Along with directing TV shows and doing voice animations for, like, Boondocks. Did y'all know she did the voice? I did not know that. She did it for Riley and Huey. Nice. Great. She's an amazing woman. So, congratulations, Regina. Yeah. She is definitely my Woman of the Week. So, Dre, who's your Woman of the Week? I think my... Well, I know my Woman of the Week would be my little sister. My little sister, Olivia. Oh, Olivia. So, fortunately, a couple weeks ago, my mother suffered a stroke. So sorry about that. So it was, you know, there was a lot going on. And all these different things. And, you know, when something like this happens to a family, there's, you know, all these different issues. And there's worries about, like, hospital stuff. And all these different things. Like, what are our next steps? And my sister came up to me. And she was like, hey, could you please help me? I was like, okay, what's going on? And she says, I'm going to look for a therapist. And I thought that was very powerful for, one, she's about to be 17 this Friday. What? That's amazing. That's really good. And, you know, a couple days later, she was like, oh, I found one. You know, there was a... I researched it. I did all this stuff. And I looked up reviews. And I was like, holy fuck. Like, I remember my therapist, my, like, quote, unquote, therapy sessions were with my best friends eating hot Cheetos in a circle. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, a 16-year-old is coming up with, you know, these things. And she's saying, hey, I know I need help. And I know I need professional help. Because it is heavy to talk about these things with your friends. Especially because some of her friends, you know, don't really understand what this is like. And what it's like to have a parent go through something like this. And she had, like, the thought to, like, seek out professional help. And the bravery to be able to do that. Because usually she sees me as this, like, authoritative figure. Because we have, like, you know, a big age gap. And she was like, I'm doing this, by the way. Aw, Olivia. You do that. Yeah, so she is my woman of the week. I know that was a long explanation. No, it's completely fine. Because she deserves it. Exactly. All right. All right.

issues that affect women and female identifying people. As you know, I am Lisa and we have guests today. First up, we have Dre, who is my friend and the founder of Girl Uninterrupted. Hey, Dre. Hey. Tell the people something about yourself. Hey, so everyone, my name is Dre. As Lisa just said, you know, she's one of my bestest friends. She's actually one of my bites mates at my wedding. And she kept me sane for most of the wedding and then she left me to go get drunk. That's okay. That's okay. Because we both got drunk. That was a good thing. Yeah, I mean, it was the whole point. Reception. Yeah, you know, we had to. We had to do that. That was your duty. That was my duty. But yeah, so I work here in Miami-Dade County. I work in a nonprofit for advocating for affordable housing and issues surrounding homelessness. So that's what I do. And so a little background on Girl Uninterrupted. Many moons ago, it was a dark night. Oh. Just kidding. So my best friend and I, we were sitting at this conference called Women Who Lead at FIU. And we were seeing all these amazing women who were talking about all these different issues. You know, one of them was Ndege Green from WLRN. And I remember looking at her. She is an inspiration. She is someone who, you know, is this amazing person. So we were like, okay, what can we do? I mean, they started out just like us. You know, they were just two kids in college, two, you know, whatever. So we decided, let's talk shit. You know, we do this all the time anyway. We might as well. You know, we were part of like various feminist clubs, various things on campus. Evelyn was part of the student radio there. And we decided, let's do a podcast. So we originally called it Miami Girl. And, you know, we had some fun with it. Lisa was actually on the show a couple times. And we decided, okay, let's continue doing this. This is really fun. And we were talking about issues that many Miami women and femmes were facing, right? Many women did not have this platform to talk and air out concerns, right? So we decided, let's continue with this. And then we saw that Miami Girl was already a name that was taken by, you know, not taken, but, you know, that was already being used by different organizations. So we decided, let's call it something else. We decided to call it Girl Uninterrupted. That's how this whole thing started. And then we got closer. I, you know, we were talking more and more. She is amazing. One, she knows the community and she can speak on all these issues. But also, she's very good at asking, you know, important questions that can really get people talking and thinking. And I think this is the best place for all of that. But yeah. I like it. Thank you, Dre. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to do all of this. I do not give it to you. You took it. Oh, my gosh. Anyway, more importantly, we have the girls of Sleepless in Miami. Yay! Janie and Rujie, please introduce yourselves. Hello, everybody. So I'm Janie. And I'm Rujie. The second host. Yes. We're co-hosts. And you explain the background. So Sleepless in Miami was born. When did we start? It's going to be about a year ago, shortly after we moved in together. Yeah. Yeah. Janie and I, we've been friends for years and years. And we quickly became best friends in the last, like, what, two years? Yeah. And I just remember her, while I was at work, always texting me, like, different questions that she herself was wondering. It's like, hey, what do you think about, you know, like, promise rings? Necessarily going on in our lives. They were just, like, hypotheticals. Like, let's just discuss. And we realized quickly that we could have, like, endless conversations about this. And there were so many good points to bring out. Because we're very different people. Like, I'm much more of an emotional, like, type of impulsive, impatient person. And she's very much more of a, let me methodically think this out, logically. You know, so we're very different in our opinion. So we thought, if we can have these super long conversations, about things, and it's shit sometimes. It really is. Yeah, we should talk all the time. But we thought that there has to be somebody out there that wants to listen to this and wants to be a part of it. And through the process, we've discovered that a lot of our listeners tell us, like, we'll be hearing you guys. And we're yelling in the car, our opinions, like, over you. Because we can hear you guys, like, going back and forth. And we feel like we're part of your podcast. Because it's such a conversational space. And, you know, relatable type of topics. Especially for young women in our age, in our millennial group. They want to come and kind of talk about the same things that they see on their social media all the time. Like, again, people buying houses. And people moving in together. And, like, having babies at a young age. And it's all of these topics that we're, like, we talk about anyways at our house. And we might as well just share it with the world and see what can come out of it. So, and a lot of it, too, it first starts out as shit talking. And then it slowly started becoming topics where it's like, wait a minute. This can actually help someone else. You know, like, this health issue is happening to me. Maybe it's happening to somebody else. And maybe they feel alone. So, let's share it. And something good will come out of it. And that's really our main goal after it. Like, at first it's just something fun, a hobby. And then maybe it can become something great. Yeah, that's what normally happens. Because that's how I came into Girl and Interrupted as well. Like, oh, let me do this to vent. Or let me do this to just talk about issues that I've dealt with. But it turned into this whole different thing. So, thank you so much for sharing the story. Because it's a great show. So, I'm happy that you guys are here. So, let's kick things off with Women of the Week. Last week was the Oscars. And there were so many amazing women who won. Like, Lady Gaga, Olivia Colman. She's ridiculous. Yeah, that performance was crazy. Ruth E. Carter for designing Black Panther. All the clothes, the costumes. But I'm going to have to give my Woman of the Week to Regina King. Who won Best Supporting Actress for If Beale Street Could Talk. Although, I don't think that amazing actors like Black actors like Regina King and so many others get the validation that they need at the Oscars. Or get as many awards that they should. But this time they did. And I'm really, really, really happy. Because she deserves it. And it's nice to see a woman who has been in the entertainment business for forever finally get her flowers. She's been in so many staple Black films and TV shows. Along with directing TV shows and doing voice animations for, like, Boondocks. Did y'all know she did the voice? I did not know that. She did it for Riley and Huey. Nice. Great. She's an amazing woman. So, congratulations, Regina. Yeah. She is definitely my Woman of the Week. So, Dre, who's your Woman of the Week? I think my... Well, I know my Woman of the Week would be my little sister. My little sister, Olivia. Oh, Olivia. So, fortunately, a couple weeks ago, my mother suffered a stroke. So sorry about that. So it was, you know, there was a lot going on. And all these different things. And, you know, when something like this happens to a family, there's, you know, all these different issues. And there's worries about, like, hospital stuff. And all these different things. Like, what are our next steps? And my sister came up to me. And she was like, hey, could you please help me? I was like, okay, what's going on? And she says, I'm going to look for a therapist. And I thought that was very powerful for, one, she's about to be 17 this Friday. What? That's amazing. That's really good. And, you know, a couple days later, she was like, oh, I found one. You know, there was a... I researched it. I did all this stuff. And I looked up reviews. And I was like, holy fuck. Like, I remember my therapist, my, like, quote, unquote, therapy sessions were with my best friends eating hot Cheetos in a circle. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, a 16-year-old is coming up with, you know, these things. And she's saying, hey, I know I need help. And I know I need professional help. Because it is heavy to talk about these things with your friends. Especially because some of her friends, you know, don't really understand what this is like. And what it's like to have a parent go through something like this. And she had, like, the thought to, like, seek out professional help. And the bravery to be able to do that. Because usually she sees me as this, like, authoritative figure. Because we have, like, you know, a big age gap. And she was like, I'm doing this, by the way. Aw, Olivia. You do that. Yeah, so she is my woman of the week. I know that was a long explanation. No, it's completely fine. Because she deserves it. Exactly. All right. All right.
