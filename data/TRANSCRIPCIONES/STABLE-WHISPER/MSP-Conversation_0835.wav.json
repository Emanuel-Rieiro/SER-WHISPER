{"text": " We've got a lot of things to talk about today. During our show last night, the local Knox County GOP held a candidates forum in which they basically, according to the new bylaw changes that took place last month. Crap. Yeah, it was pretty bad. Dropped a bomb. It'll make you sick, I'll tell you that. But they basically, I mean, in a lot of ways, they basically forced candidates to stand up and pledge their republicanism or, you know, make the pitch as to why they were republican enough to get the nomination. I'm surprised they didn't have them sign a loyalty oath. I mean, that's effectively what it seemed like. We'll get into that. There's a lot of drama going on with that. There's a lot of drama going on with that. And, you know, we're going to talk about that, you know, probably around 7, 7, 15. You don't want to miss it. Yes. And the good news is, well, Mr. Vito Segliano, hopefully I'm saying his name right. You did a good job. Yeah. There you go. Josh speaks Italian. Vito is running for Congress in this for District 2. And he was there at the meeting. He's going to be here with us at 7, 15 to talk about that. And I also understand we're going to have the former GOP chair, Miss Ruthie Coleman, talking to us about this as well. So we're going to talk about that around 7 o'clock. Get into the drama, you know, at the end of the hour. But before we get into that, I wanted to do a little discussion on local news. So not sure if you guys heard, but this article just broke today. Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway acquired a majority stake in Pilot Flying J. Yeah. The world's going to end. I know. Here it comes, guys. Warren Buffett on the move again. Right. So the Haslam family is no longer the majority stakeholder in Pilot Flying J. And Berkshire Hathaway is moving on. They have officially 50.1% of stock in Pilot Flying J. Wow. It's strange to have the Haslams not owning Pilot anymore. Yeah. Well, and OK, so there was an article in the News Sentinel about this today. But the thing about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway is they're not in the business of going into a business and acquiring them and changing everything. Right. They like to keep the people there and they like to keep the headquarters where they are. You know, Warren Buffett is a smart man. So good businessman. He likes to play the part. That's right. He likes to play the part. Yeah. So they're not changing anything. I think Jim Haslam is the CEO right now. Yes. The brother of the governor. Yeah. He's staying. He's staying as CEO at least until the 2020s. So not much is going to change there. It's just a kind of an interesting dynamic. I mean, that's a big company. Big player. I mean, they've got their headquarters right off I-40. Right. I wonder what made them so interested. Yeah. I wonder if it was, you know, maybe a political thing or maybe a political thing or maybe just a political thing. I don't know. You know, that's what I've heard from people. It's like, oh, well, Warren Buffett buying out, you know, the Haslams. I don't know. I really don't. He's buying them out for a reason. There's something going on. It's pure speculation, but I'm not afraid to say that maybe Jim or just with Governor Haslam being in politics and everyone was pretty upset with the gas tax. Made that connection. Yeah. Connected the dots. That's actually an interesting thought. I kind of want to dive into that. What are they going to say? What are they going to say? Well, I don't own. I don't own a private jet. I don't do that anymore. That wasn't my fault. Yeah. Right. What's it going to say about that? I mean, technically they can. They don't own the majority. I mean, they have like 30% stock, but still. The deal went through like super quick, too. It was only like three months. Just insanely fast. Yeah. It's very fast for the corporate world to get all those things lined up properly. So, I mean, apparently somebody wanted to make it happen. Yeah, it was fast. Come on. This was planned. I don't know. This happened way too quickly. It was. This was just. It wasn't like something that was like, you know, televised everywhere. It was keep behind closed doors. It's. It was just way. It's a plan. And I don't know what it is, but it's pissing me off. Let's put it this way. Bill Haslam just hasn't officially announced, but he's talking about running for Senate. Right. And then on the heels of the gas tax thing. You go. Which, I mean, there were protests in Knoxville. Protesting. Protesting the gas tax at pilot locations. Yeah. So, you know, I guess that could make sense. Right. I mean, maybe distance himself a little bit from from that political nature of that. Let's not forget that pilot had to pay ninety two million dollars to settle that trucking corruption scandal. Oh, yeah. He wasn't involved in that. He was never charged or they never said. But it just removes him one more step from that name that he's so associated with and pilot. So. Well, I'm pilots. A pretty big company. I mean, they've got seven hundred fifty locations. They've got. They're over twenty billion dollars in revenue. That's a lot of money. A lot of bank. Yeah. I mean, they started in like the 50s with the small gas station in Virginia and kind of grew into this huge empire. One gas station to seven. I mean, that's that's an American, you know, success story right there. Netflix need to make a movie about that. They could watch it. Haslam. Haslam. The real. Behind the gas. If there's nothing else there. The family behind the gas. There you go. There you go. You just. Sold a movie. Josh is going to be rich. Yeah. That's a Netflix taxpayer's money going down the drain. That's what it is. I'll help produce the documentary. Yeah. I don't think they'd let us near them. No. Well, it's funny, though, because this isn't the first company that Berkshire Hathaway has actually come in East Tennessee and purchased or got majority stakeholders in it. So Clayton Homes, another big company around here. They also. Biggest. And I think they're the biggest manufactured home company in the world. Right. I know in the country. I know that they paid one point seven billion dollars. For their ownership in 2003. Yeah. They wanted it bad. Yeah. But the awesome thing is the the CEO stayed on. Yeah. And nothing's changed. And they kept their headquarters where it is. And so he's he's you know, that's that's their M.O. Yeah. I mean, the plus you got to give him props for it where it deserves. That's a good that's a good way to do things is when you have someone, you know, come into a business by a by a business and just destroy everything and not really destroy, but change everything. It really takes your standards down and it can really fluctuate because those people have been in this company. They're working for this company. They know how it rolls and know how to deal with the environment and people and their consumers. So it's always best to do that, not just come in and destroy companies like we used to do in the 80s and the 90s. I've I've worked for businesses before where they were talking about, oh, someone's thinking of buying us and people get afraid because they're thinking, oh, I'm going to I might lose my job. You never know the shakeup that's going to happen. So I mean, I mean, just like when UT was getting ready to, you know, kind of go back to private like a long time ago. A lot of the people, a lot of the workers in there who's at the school, they were afraid. They're like, I'm gonna lose my job. I'm gonna lose my my retirement. And after that, they're just like, oh, well, it's not gonna happen. It's great. Yeah, it's really not a smart investment move to go in and then just like destroy everything. Unless you have a unless you're buying a business that is already in trouble. Now, that might be the but these businesses are they're not in trouble at all. If your business is in trouble, make sure you call Vanilla Ice. He does a great job at flipping things. Is that right? Yeah, it's just like pit my ride, man. Good. Oh, costume. It looks good. Good to know. He's ripping out your kitchen and your friends come over. Is that Vanilla Ice? Is that Vanilla Ice? Ice, ice, baby. Did he just make you get some more money in your account? My God, what a great gas station. I don't get this reference, but I'm going to smile. Oh, my God. I'm just too young for this or something. Are you too young or too white? That's what I want to know. How do you not know Vanilla Ice? I know who Vanilla Ice is. No, no, no. How do you not know he has his own show destroying houses and then flipping them just like pit my ride? He's flipping pit's houses now. That's crazy. His name is like Rob Van Winkle. Is it like HGTV? Huh? HGTV? I don't know. It sounds like an HGTV show. I'm not going to say on the radio whether or not I watch HGTV, but I would think. Don't expose yourself, Alex. I would think it might be on that channel. Oh, man. Sounds like. We've worn this topic out, so let me just say that. But we're having so much fun. We are. We are for sure. And I don't want to ruin anyone's fun. I did see an interesting article about this, something that I thought was pretty interesting to this Tesla tractor. Trailer. Did you guys hear about that? Yes. So it was a couple months ago. Musk, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, is talking about the next unit they're going to bring, the next model. And apparently they're bringing a tractor trailer to market. They did the announcement a couple months ago. It's got apparently about, it's going to have apparently about a 300 mile range. The cool thing is, the thing in the news this week is that a photo leaked. So you can go online, look, Tesla, semi or Tesla tractor trailer, whatever. And it's somebody snapped a shot of this truck sitting on another truck, sitting on a trailer in this lot and nowhere in the land, California. And it was kind of cool because, I mean, it's really futuristic looking. It's obviously going to be an all electric truck. 300 miles is, you know, not necessarily long range, but. I heard it charges in an hour, though. That's crazy. That's, yeah. I think that was the one. And just an hour to charge a semi. I mean, that's pretty amazing. I just, I wonder how many government subsidies it took. Well, you know me, always causing trouble. So I know. Don't you think about the future? I didn't, to be fair, I didn't prep for this discussion about subsidies beforehand. But from what I understand, every business loan, or I'm sorry, every government loan that Tesla has taken, they have paid back or are on track to pay back. So that's good. I'm just, I'm, you know, upset that the government has money to loan people. That's the thing. Don't you have to share? Because it's not their money. It's my money. And it's your money. Isn't there a couple things that you have to take care of other than just paying Tesla? Come on. Yeah. Well, I haven't even seen it, though, guys. I'm not going to lie. I haven't seen it. I saw it. And I saw you guys talking about it. I was like, I don't even want to see it because I don't want to look at something that I can't afford. Just like the Tesla car. I can't afford it. I'm not going to look at it. I'm not into tractor porn. So. Josh is looking at tractors online. Oh, electric tractors. This great tractor. I mean, it was a cool looking truck. He's going to paint it green when he gets there. I work in transportation, so I'm curious about it. And it is an interesting, you know, dynamic. Yeah, that coming to the market is going to disrupt a lot of things, especially if they can deliver the price point that people are assuming. Again, there's a lot of contingencies. But from what I understand, this is kicking off competition among competitors, too, because Cummins is planning on coming to market with one. I've heard many different manufacturers are considering it. I don't know how far along they are in the development process. Our producer, Justin, mentioned to me that a point that I hadn't thought of, which was that it would force drivers to stop every so often and rest, you know, because they're supposed to stop after a certain amount of time. Is it eight to ten hours? I want to say it is like an eight or ten hour deal. I haven't looked into the six hours. I have a future family member who drives trucks and stuff like that. And I could have sworn he said it was like nine hours. It sounds right. Well, that would be cool. Because then they can build into the software then, you know, necessarily necessary systems to keep these drivers safe and be compliant with the law. And in a lot of ways, too, you think about trucking. Not a lot of people think about data and analytics, but there's a big push right now in the industry to like tie, you know, you basically put smart tech in trucks so that you can maximize efficiency, give a lot more data to like these fleet owners so they can understand where the trucks are, who's using them, whether they're being efficient in their route, whether they're, you know, like it counts. How many turns they take, for example. There's also software that goes into these trucks nowadays that can communicate with the dealership. So if the truck flashes a code, it can immediately go in and schedule your visit at the next dealership. That's cool. Yeah, it's really, really cool. That's a technology I want in my mom van. I feel like Josh is trying to sell me this. Look how smart you are. I told you I do this for a living. He wants us to buy it. He's trying to tell the world, buy this. No, no, no, don't buy it. Invest. Invest now. I just thought it was a cool little looking truck, so definitely worth looking at. But we got about two minutes before we go to break. I want to move to the next topic because we don't have a long segment on the next segment. We've obviously got a short one. This whole Vegas shooting deal, I mean, I know it's a downer of a topic and it's obviously a really sad situation, but there's been some details that have come out today that I thought were rather interesting. So apparently, you guys know the death toll's been updated, 59 dead, 527 wounded. And apparently they found out that there were 23 weapons, including semi-automatic rifles, scopes, hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his hotel room. I'm not going to say the guy's name, the shooter. They found all these weapons. Apparently, and this is where the story gets weird, he was a multimillionaire, made a bunch of money in real estate. He used to work for the IRS. Not who you would expect. Yep. His dad was a bank robber on the FBI's most wanted list. Avid gambler. But here's where the story gets weird. So his girlfriend during the shooting was in the Philippines. Right. She's scheduled to come back from the Philippines tomorrow. Nobody's mentioned her as a suspect. They mentioned her as a person of interest. Right. But I'm curious to see what comes out when she gets back. I watched the press conference with the brother and he talked about that and said that it was super sad. I mean, you know, their family is heartbroken as well. I am. And, you know, it's horrible. But he said it was like there were two different people that this isn't the guy they knew at all. So sad. So that he thinks he sent her away to protect her. Yeah, keeping her isolated from all the craziness. He did transfer $10,000 to a bank account in the Philippines. Yeah. Something to think about, something to chew about. We're going to go to break, though. But we will be back after the commercial break, so don't go anywhere. And Vito will be in the studio at 7.15 to talk to us. We're going to talk to us about these bylaw changes. We're going to have a good time. Don't touch that dial. If you want to get in on the conversation, Pure Magic Hotline, 865-888-TALK.

There's a lot of drama going on with that. And, you know, we're going to talk about that, you know, probably around 7, 7, 15. You don't want to miss it. Yes. And the good news is, well, Mr. Vito Segliano, hopefully I'm saying his name right. You did a good job. Yeah. There you go. Josh speaks Italian. Vito is running for Congress in this for District 2. And he was there at the meeting. He's going to be here with us at 7, 15 to talk about that. And I also understand we're going to have the former GOP chair, Miss Ruthie Coleman, talking to us about this as well. So we're going to talk about that around 7 o'clock. Get into the drama, you know, at the end of the hour. But before we get into that, I wanted to do a little discussion on local news. So not sure if you guys heard, but this article just broke today. Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway acquired a majority stake in Pilot Flying J. Yeah. The world's going to end. I know. Here it comes, guys. Warren Buffett on the move again. Right. So the Haslam family is no longer the majority stakeholder in Pilot Flying J. And Berkshire Hathaway is moving on. They have officially 50.1% of stock in Pilot Flying J. Wow. It's strange to have the Haslams not owning Pilot anymore. Yeah. Well, and OK, so there was an article in the News Sentinel about this today. But the thing about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway is they're not in the business of going into a business and acquiring them and changing everything. Right. They like to keep the people there and they like to keep the headquarters where they are. You know, Warren Buffett is a smart man. So good businessman. He likes to play the part. That's right. He likes to play the part. Yeah. So they're not changing anything. I think Jim Haslam is the CEO right now. Yes. The brother of the governor. Yeah. He's staying. He's staying as CEO at least until the 2020s. So not much is going to change there. It's just a kind of an interesting dynamic. I mean, that's a big company. Big player. I mean, they've got their headquarters right off I-40. Right. I wonder what made them so interested. Yeah. I wonder if it was, you know, maybe a political thing or maybe a political thing or maybe just a political thing. I don't know. You know, that's what I've heard from people. It's like, oh, well, Warren Buffett buying out, you know, the Haslams. I don't know. I really don't. He's buying them out for a reason. There's something going on. It's pure speculation, but I'm not afraid to say that maybe Jim or just with Governor Haslam being in politics and everyone was pretty upset with the gas tax. Made that connection. Yeah. Connected the dots. That's actually an interesting thought. I kind of want to dive into that. What are they going to say? What are they going to say? Well, I don't own. I don't own a private jet. I don't do that anymore. That wasn't my fault. Yeah. Right. What's it going to say about that? I mean, technically they can. They don't own the majority. I mean, they have like 30% stock, but still. The deal went through like super quick, too. It was only like three months. Just insanely fast. Yeah. It's very fast for the corporate world to get all those things lined up properly. So, I mean, apparently somebody wanted to make it happen. Yeah, it was fast. Come on. This was planned. I don't know. This happened way too quickly. It was. This was just. It wasn't like something that was like, you know, televised everywhere. It was keep behind closed doors. It's. It was just way. It's a plan. And I don't know what it is, but it's pissing me off. Let's put it this way. Bill Haslam just hasn't officially announced, but he's talking about running for Senate. Right. And then on the heels of the gas tax thing. You go. Which, I mean, there were protests in Knoxville. Protesting. Protesting the gas tax at pilot locations. Yeah. So, you know, I guess that could make sense. Right. I mean, maybe distance himself a little bit from from that political nature of that. Let's not forget that pilot had to pay ninety two million dollars to settle that trucking corruption scandal. Oh, yeah. He wasn't involved in that. He was never charged or they never said. But it just removes him one more step from that name that he's so associated with and pilot. So. Well, I'm pilots. A pretty big company. I mean, they've got seven hundred fifty locations. They've got. They're over twenty billion dollars in revenue. That's a lot of money. A lot of bank. Yeah. I mean, they started in like the 50s with the small gas station in Virginia and kind of grew into this huge empire. One gas station to seven. I mean, that's that's an American, you know, success story right there. Netflix need to make a movie about that. They could watch it. Haslam. Haslam. The real. Behind the gas. If there's nothing else there. The family behind the gas. There you go. There you go. You just. Sold a movie. Josh is going to be rich. Yeah. That's a Netflix taxpayer's money going down the drain. That's what it is. I'll help produce the documentary. Yeah. I don't think they'd let us near them. No. Well, it's funny, though, because this isn't the first company that Berkshire Hathaway has actually come in East Tennessee and purchased or got majority stakeholders in it. So Clayton Homes, another big company around here. They also. Biggest. And I think they're the biggest manufactured home company in the world. Right. I know in the country. I know that they paid one point seven billion dollars. For their ownership in 2003. Yeah. They wanted it bad. Yeah. But the awesome thing is the the CEO stayed on. Yeah. And nothing's changed. And they kept their headquarters where it is. And so he's he's you know, that's that's their M.O. Yeah. I mean, the plus you got to give him props for it where it deserves. That's a good that's a good way to do things is when you have someone, you know, come into a business by a by a business and just destroy everything and not really destroy, but change everything. It really takes your standards down and it can really fluctuate because those people have been in this company. They're working for this company. They know how it rolls and know how to deal with the environment and people and their consumers. So it's always best to do that, not just come in and destroy companies like we used to do in the 80s and the 90s. I've I've worked for businesses before where they were talking about, oh, someone's thinking of buying us and people get afraid because they're thinking, oh, I'm going to I might lose my job. You never know the shakeup that's going to happen. So I mean, I mean, just like when UT was getting ready to, you know, kind of go back to private like a long time ago. A lot of the people, a lot of the workers in there who's at the school, they were afraid. They're like, I'm gonna lose my job. I'm gonna lose my my retirement. And after that, they're just like, oh, well, it's not gonna happen. It's great. Yeah, it's really not a smart investment move to go in and then just like destroy everything. Unless you have a unless you're buying a business that is already in trouble. Now, that might be the but these businesses are they're not in trouble at all. If your business is in trouble, make sure you call Vanilla Ice. He does a great job at flipping things. Is that right? Yeah, it's just like pit my ride, man. Good. Oh, costume. It looks good. Good to know. He's ripping out your kitchen and your friends come over. Is that Vanilla Ice? Is that Vanilla Ice? Ice, ice, baby. Did he just make you get some more money in your account? My God, what a great gas station. I don't get this reference, but I'm going to smile. Oh, my God. I'm just too young for this or something. Are you too young or too white? That's what I want to know. How do you not know Vanilla Ice? I know who Vanilla Ice is. No, no, no. How do you not know he has his own show destroying houses and then flipping them just like pit my ride? He's flipping pit's houses now. That's crazy. His name is like Rob Van Winkle. Is it like HGTV? Huh? HGTV? I don't know. It sounds like an HGTV show. I'm not going to say on the radio whether or not I watch HGTV, but I would think. Don't expose yourself, Alex. I would think it might be on that channel. Oh, man. Sounds like. We've worn this topic out, so let me just say that. But we're having so much fun. We are. We are for sure. And I don't want to ruin anyone's fun. I did see an interesting article about this, something that I thought was pretty interesting to this Tesla tractor. Trailer. Did you guys hear about that? Yes. So it was a couple months ago. Musk, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, is talking about the next unit they're going to bring, the next model. And apparently they're bringing a tractor trailer to market. They did the announcement a couple months ago. It's got apparently about, it's going to have apparently about a 300 mile range. The cool thing is, the thing in the news this week is that a photo leaked. So you can go online, look, Tesla, semi or Tesla tractor trailer, whatever. And it's somebody snapped a shot of this truck sitting on another truck, sitting on a trailer in this lot and nowhere in the land, California. And it was kind of cool because, I mean, it's really futuristic looking. It's obviously going to be an all electric truck. 300 miles is, you know, not necessarily long range, but. I heard it charges in an hour, though. That's crazy. That's, yeah. I think that was the one. And just an hour to charge a semi. I mean, that's pretty amazing. I just, I wonder how many government subsidies it took. Well, you know me, always causing trouble. So I know. Don't you think about the future? I didn't, to be fair, I didn't prep for this discussion about subsidies beforehand. But from what I understand, every business loan, or I'm sorry, every government loan that Tesla has taken, they have paid back or are on track to pay back. So that's good. I'm just, I'm, you know, upset that the government has money to loan people. That's the thing. Don't you have to share? Because it's not their money. It's my money. And it's your money. Isn't there a couple things that you have to take care of other than just paying Tesla? Come on. Yeah. Well, I haven't even seen it, though, guys. I'm not going to lie. I haven't seen it. I saw it. And I saw you guys talking about it. I was like, I don't even want to see it because I don't want to look at something that I can't afford. Just like the Tesla car. I can't afford it. I'm not going to look at it. I'm not into tractor porn. So. Josh is looking at tractors online. Oh, electric tractors. This great tractor. I mean, it was a cool looking truck. He's going to paint it green when he gets there. I work in transportation, so I'm curious about it. And it is an interesting, you know, dynamic. Yeah, that coming to the market is going to disrupt a lot of things, especially if they can deliver the price point that people are assuming. Again, there's a lot of contingencies. But from what I understand, this is kicking off competition among competitors, too, because Cummins is planning on coming to market with one. I've heard many different manufacturers are considering it. I don't know how far along they are in the development process. Our producer, Justin, mentioned to me that a point that I hadn't thought of, which was that it would force drivers to stop every so often and rest, you know, because they're supposed to stop after a certain amount of time. Is it eight to ten hours? I want to say it is like an eight or ten hour deal. I haven't looked into the six hours. I have a future family member who drives trucks and stuff like that. And I could have sworn he said it was like nine hours. It sounds right. Well, that would be cool. Because then they can build into the software then, you know, necessarily necessary systems to keep these drivers safe and be compliant with the law. And in a lot of ways, too, you think about trucking. Not a lot of people think about data and analytics, but there's a big push right now in the industry to like tie, you know, you basically put smart tech in trucks so that you can maximize efficiency, give a lot more data to like these fleet owners so they can understand where the trucks are, who's using them, whether they're being efficient in their route, whether they're, you know, like it counts. How many turns they take, for example. There's also software that goes into these trucks nowadays that can communicate with the dealership. So if the truck flashes a code, it can immediately go in and schedule your visit at the next dealership. That's cool. Yeah, it's really, really cool. That's a technology I want in my mom van. I feel like Josh is trying to sell me this. Look how smart you are. I told you I do this for a living. He wants us to buy it. He's trying to tell the world, buy this. No, no, no, don't buy it. Invest. Invest now. I just thought it was a cool little looking truck, so definitely worth looking at. But we got about two minutes before we go to break. I want to move to the next topic because we don't have a long segment on the next segment. We've obviously got a short one. This whole Vegas shooting deal, I mean, I know it's a downer of a topic and it's obviously a really sad situation, but there's been some details that have come out today that I thought were rather interesting. So apparently, you guys know the death toll's been updated, 59 dead, 527 wounded. And apparently they found out that there were 23 weapons, including semi-automatic rifles, scopes, hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his hotel room. I'm not going to say the guy's name, the shooter. They found all these weapons. Apparently, and this is where the story gets weird, he was a multimillionaire, made a bunch of money in real estate. He used to work for the IRS. Not who you would expect. Yep. His dad was a bank robber on the FBI's most wanted list. Avid gambler. But here's where the story gets weird. So his girlfriend during the shooting was in the Philippines. Right. She's scheduled to come back from the Philippines tomorrow. Nobody's mentioned her as a suspect. They mentioned her as a person of interest. Right. But I'm curious to see what comes out when she gets back. I watched the press conference with the brother and he talked about that and said that it was super sad. I mean, you know, their family is heartbroken as well. I am. And, you know, it's horrible. But he said it was like there were two different people that this isn't the guy they knew at all. So sad. So that he thinks he sent her away to protect her. Yeah, keeping her isolated from all the craziness. He did transfer $10,000 to a bank account in the Philippines. Yeah. Something to think about, something to chew about. We're going to go to break, though. But we will be back after the commercial break, so don't go anywhere. And Vito will be in the studio at 7.15 to talk to us. We're going to talk to us about these bylaw changes. We're going to have a good time. Don't touch that dial. If you want to get in on the conversation, Pure Magic Hotline, 865-888-TALK.
