{"text": " I would love to talk about that. I'd love to talk about all the things that you're doing that you'd like to share with us. Tell me a little bit, though, about this whole hip situation. Okay, cool. Well, I think all office have a different kind of, almost kind of a resonant rhythm whenever we're walking, and there are so many factors that are going to go into that. There's leg length, hip distance, so hip width, that's when we're looking at pelvis width, and a lot of it is also, we all have a different kind of elastic tuning to our tissues. Sure. Maybe it was more loosely or more tightly kind of put together. Yeah. It's all the hypermobility tests, so some of us are just a little bit more muscular, some of us are a little bit more elastic, some of us are very tightly bound, some of us are loosely bound. And so there are some kind of biomechanical factors and variables that be in it. And then there's also psychology. There's this, you know, what's your attitude about movement? What's your natural tendency? You know, we see people that are very, you know, we were in New York, and it's fascinating, you know, New Yorkers are kind of, they're direct. They're direct in their talk, they're direct in their actions, and they're direct in their movement. And they have to be to survive. You know, I remember, you know, I'm, I'm from a little town of, you know, 10,000 people on the edge of Belfast, Northern Ireland, which is why I have a slightly different, weird accent. And, like, there, it was like, if you're at a crossing, and if there was one other person there, it was like, it was, my goodness, what's that person doing at my crossing? But in New York, it's like, it's like the stampede. It's like that, the migration across the Serengeti. Yeah. But you're not all going in the same direction. You've got one herd going one way, and the other herd coming the other way. So you have to stand, you've got, you're, well, you're not going to be, oh, very much, yeah. Going forward. And, so, some of us are a little bit more laid back in our movement, and we're walking. Some of us go for, you know, for a saunter. And some of us kind of, you know, we're full on kind of pushing through it. And, and, and some of that is, so there's psychology, and that's going to pertain, go back to whether we're using more of a muscular kind of pushing strategy, or whether we're using more of a kind of a relaxed kind of elastic strategy. And, you know, it's all, there are so many variables that will go into speed, that it's kind of, it's, it's, you know, I would need to, to see, see what's happening with your wives and what's happening with the two of you, to be able to kind of go, oh, okay, well, I think it's more of this variable or that variable. But in whenever we're together in September, one of the, one of the dynamics we're talking about, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of epidemic within a lot of the literature that women tend to have wider hips. And the literature would kind of need to believe that that actually gives less efficiency because they've got wider hips, they've got a kind of a wider lever. Whenever you're standing on one leg, they have to support their body weight on a longer lever. So that actually gives them more work to do. But actually, a combination of a couple of different papers that would come out, one from Dan Lieberman, said, well, actually, the thinking was wrong, the calculations are wrong, actually doesn't make them any less efficient at all. And another paper is actually saying, well, actually, some of the extra width that may actually lead to more efficiency or a different type of efficiency. And a lot of women or people with wider hips, let's just say, because there's an overlap, there's no absolute, there's no male pelvis. Sure, yeah. This is about weight and pelvis. So actually, having a wider pelvis allows people with wider pelvises to walk together and be happier at a kind of communal speed. So with a more narrow pelvis, we have a narrow and happy speed. So if we have to walk more quickly or more slowly than our happy speeds, it costs us more energy. Okay, sure. And if you have a narrow pelvis, you have a very narrow kind of efficient speed. Whereas with a wider pelvis, we've got a more of a, in that graph, we have a kind of a wider range at which you can still be kind of strolling along and being quite happy and still maintain a chat. And that could be more quickly or more slowly than our narrow pelvis kind of bias. That's interesting. This is kind of random. There are some musician friends of mine who, so in my former life, I was a musician for a living. But there was a very famous musician, Joe Zawinul is his name, from Austria, actually. He was a jazz musician, very successfully passed away a few years ago. But I remember him talking about gait, and not in terms of biomechanics, but in terms of confidence, a lot of different things, whether they're angry, happy. And I actually, I hadn't planned on mentioning this or asking this question, but do our emotions have anything to do with our gait? Absolutely. And I suppose you just take me back to an early, one of the, an early book that got me interested in complementary therapies. I was originally, as a teenager, I was interested in astrology and tarot and kind of strange things. And one book, I think it was the Psychic Explorer. And I was talking about the science of the zodiac. And they suggested, an experiment, going for a walk with the attitude of the sun, so full of energy and brightness, and then going for a walk with the energy of the, I can't remember all the different energies of the planets, but going for a walk at like Mars. If you want to, if you want to survive in New York, you have, you take on the kind of the warrior-like kind of strength of Mars. And, you know, and then there's the, the more, loose kind of rhythmic, maybe seductive movement of Venus. Okay. Well, we can actually change our emotions by taking on these movement patterns. And of course, this, this, this works both ways, that our movement will, will reflect our moods. You know, you can tell, you know, maybe if, if you see your wife walking down the street at a distance, you know whether you're in trouble or not. Sometimes she's, she explains something. Yeah. Thinking back to your mother or, you know. I was just doing that too. I was just doing it. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's kind of, it's a, you know, it is literally a two-way street. That's our, our emotions affect our movements, but we can also affect our emotions by, by moving in a different way, by moving in different characteristics. And, and, you know, some of the, the attitude that we have to take on. And it's interesting, you know, we use attitude in both those senses, attitude and attitudes, physical. Interesting. I haven't, you know, it's interesting. I sort of knew this, but you just helped to explain it for me in a much more complete summary. Like in our workshops that I teach, the Parkinson's things, we, we know, like, for example, in Parkinson's disease, a lot of times, they'll have a more stooped over posture. You know, a lot of people do anyways. In fact, I do, if I'm not careful, it's easy for me to be kind of forward, you know, I'm sitting a lot. I'm on planes a lot. I'm whatever. But in Parkinson's, it tends to be a little more exaggerated, but also the number one non-motor symptom is depression. So depressed people don't usually walk with really super upright posture and a confident gait. Yeah. But one of the things we've found to be helpful, is when we, when we cue them into gradually, we have kind of a process I like to go through to create more of a gradual awareness of what they can be moving like versus what they usually move like. And putting in some arm swing initiated from the shoulder joint, a little bit of reciprocal arm swing, plus some trunk rotation automatically brings you a little bit more upright. And then when they walk, more upright, and I call it like walking like a badass or walking with an attitude because you can't, you're not going to walk around all upright if you're depressed. But if you can start to get into more upright position, velocity increases, usually stability improves a little. And you know what, they just start to feel a little bit better. Like, oh, it feels good. So that totally makes sense about how each one of them affects each. Emotions affect movement, movement can affect emotions. Yep. Yep. And I'm bringing back memories again. Whenever I was studying as a kid for exams, I used to study late at night and occasionally I couldn't, to let myself go to sleep after studying, I had to go for a walk and I had a recording of Isao Tomita's, kind of the Jean-Michel Jarre kind of equivalent in Japanese. But he had a Holst Planet Suite, all on synthesizer. So I used to go for a walk around the countryside at two o'clock in the morning, listening to this, the Holst Planet Suite. And I would sometimes go through those different kind of moods. So each planet had a different mood. And I'm kind of thinking of the Mars sequence and it's very, it's very martial. It's very upright. It's very confident. It's very strident. There's an overlap of language and physicality, motion to be strident, to stride out, to be strong. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I'm going a little off track here, but I'm going back to New York City because it's very interesting to see the difference in different cultures and movement, cities and movement. Of course, you've seen that probably more than anyone. You do a lot of traveling. Quite a bit. I do a lot of traveling, but you go a lot of places. Yeah. Thankfully, I'm slowly done. Yeah. So it's interesting, like in New York City, you're right. There's this herd thing and you have to stand your ground. The way you said that is so appropriate because otherwise you're going to get run over. Same thing when you're driving in New York City. I mean, you know, that's why I take Uber. Or subway. But versus, let's say, going to pretty much anywhere else. Right? So I guess that kind of also makes me wonder how much society has to do with movement. Like where you live, does that affect your movement? Like subconsciously, you just take on certain movement of a certain where you are. Yeah. Oh, there's so much to talk about with that. Once upon a time, I was working with another teacher. And he had a particular walk. He's very bendy, but a very strong guy. And he had a particular kind of wavy walk. It was very particular to him. And he had a child, a little boy. And we had a big meeting once. And we were kind of hanging out after the meeting in the bar. And he was playing with this kid. And eventually, it was 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. Okay, it's bedtime. And so we watched him. Leaning his little boy across the dance floor and across kind of in front of the bar, back off to the hotel room. And you can see both of them moving in exactly the same particular way. So there's a level of influences in the style of movement I want to. As a kid, your input, how do I move, is kind of the first strongest influence is going to be parents. So I get to see my parents. How do we walk? And then, especially as teenagers, there's going to be a certain culture. And I don't know about you, but whenever you were growing up, for me, it was kind of sort of modern rockers. They had a different style of dress and a little bit of different movement. As a rocker, you had to have a certain, again, certain attitude. And I grew up close to Belfast. So during the 70s and 80s, there was the Troubles and the conflict between the Protestant and Catholic. And every 12th of July, the Protestants would put on lots of parades and kind of show their supposed dominance and superiority. And they would walk in the street. You could tell that you were getting close to that time when a certain section would start kind of walking with their shoulders up and their elbows out. And that was my first kind of impression. Then traveling around, a little bit more around through England, I thought, actually, there's a kind of like there's a New York walk. There's a London walk. I think there was a Boston walk as well. It's a little more uptight, a little bit more contained, a little less space than the New Yorkers. New Yorkers, you have to fight for your space. And maybe around Liverpool, there's a kind of, there's a very strong sea influence. So there's a little bit more of a, a role to their walk. And, you know, so was the whole kind of the Beatles and the music is really important. So I do think different, different cultures, different cities, different energies, musical influences, cultural influences.

I'd love to talk about all the things that you're doing that you'd like to share with us. Tell me a little bit, though, about this whole hip situation. Okay, cool. Well, I think all office have a different kind of, almost kind of a resonant rhythm whenever we're walking, and there are so many factors that are going to go into that. There's leg length, hip distance, so hip width, that's when we're looking at pelvis width, and a lot of it is also, we all have a different kind of elastic tuning to our tissues. Sure. Maybe it was more loosely or more tightly kind of put together. Yeah. It's all the hypermobility tests, so some of us are just a little bit more muscular, some of us are a little bit more elastic, some of us are very tightly bound, some of us are loosely bound. And so there are some kind of biomechanical factors and variables that be in it. And then there's also psychology. There's this, you know, what's your attitude about movement? What's your natural tendency? You know, we see people that are very, you know, we were in New York, and it's fascinating, you know, New Yorkers are kind of, they're direct. They're direct in their talk, they're direct in their actions, and they're direct in their movement. And they have to be to survive. You know, I remember, you know, I'm, I'm from a little town of, you know, 10,000 people on the edge of Belfast, Northern Ireland, which is why I have a slightly different, weird accent. And, like, there, it was like, if you're at a crossing, and if there was one other person there, it was like, it was, my goodness, what's that person doing at my crossing? But in New York, it's like, it's like the stampede. It's like that, the migration across the Serengeti. Yeah. But you're not all going in the same direction. You've got one herd going one way, and the other herd coming the other way. So you have to stand, you've got, you're, well, you're not going to be, oh, very much, yeah. Going forward. And, so, some of us are a little bit more laid back in our movement, and we're walking. Some of us go for, you know, for a saunter. And some of us kind of, you know, we're full on kind of pushing through it. And, and, and some of that is, so there's psychology, and that's going to pertain, go back to whether we're using more of a muscular kind of pushing strategy, or whether we're using more of a kind of a relaxed kind of elastic strategy. And, you know, it's all, there are so many variables that will go into speed, that it's kind of, it's, it's, you know, I would need to, to see, see what's happening with your wives and what's happening with the two of you, to be able to kind of go, oh, okay, well, I think it's more of this variable or that variable. But in whenever we're together in September, one of the, one of the dynamics we're talking about, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of epidemic within a lot of the literature that women tend to have wider hips. And the literature would kind of need to believe that that actually gives less efficiency because they've got wider hips, they've got a kind of a wider lever. Whenever you're standing on one leg, they have to support their body weight on a longer lever. So that actually gives them more work to do. But actually, a combination of a couple of different papers that would come out, one from Dan Lieberman, said, well, actually, the thinking was wrong, the calculations are wrong, actually doesn't make them any less efficient at all. And another paper is actually saying, well, actually, some of the extra width that may actually lead to more efficiency or a different type of efficiency. And a lot of women or people with wider hips, let's just say, because there's an overlap, there's no absolute, there's no male pelvis. Sure, yeah. This is about weight and pelvis. So actually, having a wider pelvis allows people with wider pelvises to walk together and be happier at a kind of communal speed. So with a more narrow pelvis, we have a narrow and happy speed. So if we have to walk more quickly or more slowly than our happy speeds, it costs us more energy. Okay, sure. And if you have a narrow pelvis, you have a very narrow kind of efficient speed. Whereas with a wider pelvis, we've got a more of a, in that graph, we have a kind of a wider range at which you can still be kind of strolling along and being quite happy and still maintain a chat. And that could be more quickly or more slowly than our narrow pelvis kind of bias. That's interesting. This is kind of random. There are some musician friends of mine who, so in my former life, I was a musician for a living. But there was a very famous musician, Joe Zawinul is his name, from Austria, actually. He was a jazz musician, very successfully passed away a few years ago. But I remember him talking about gait, and not in terms of biomechanics, but in terms of confidence, a lot of different things, whether they're angry, happy. And I actually, I hadn't planned on mentioning this or asking this question, but do our emotions have anything to do with our gait? Absolutely. And I suppose you just take me back to an early, one of the, an early book that got me interested in complementary therapies. I was originally, as a teenager, I was interested in astrology and tarot and kind of strange things. And one book, I think it was the Psychic Explorer. And I was talking about the science of the zodiac. And they suggested, an experiment, going for a walk with the attitude of the sun, so full of energy and brightness, and then going for a walk with the energy of the, I can't remember all the different energies of the planets, but going for a walk at like Mars. If you want to, if you want to survive in New York, you have, you take on the kind of the warrior-like kind of strength of Mars. And, you know, and then there's the, the more, loose kind of rhythmic, maybe seductive movement of Venus. Okay. Well, we can actually change our emotions by taking on these movement patterns. And of course, this, this, this works both ways, that our movement will, will reflect our moods. You know, you can tell, you know, maybe if, if you see your wife walking down the street at a distance, you know whether you're in trouble or not. Sometimes she's, she explains something. Yeah. Thinking back to your mother or, you know. I was just doing that too. I was just doing it. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's kind of, it's a, you know, it is literally a two-way street. That's our, our emotions affect our movements, but we can also affect our emotions by, by moving in a different way, by moving in different characteristics. And, and, you know, some of the, the attitude that we have to take on. And it's interesting, you know, we use attitude in both those senses, attitude and attitudes, physical. Interesting. I haven't, you know, it's interesting. I sort of knew this, but you just helped to explain it for me in a much more complete summary. Like in our workshops that I teach, the Parkinson's things, we, we know, like, for example, in Parkinson's disease, a lot of times, they'll have a more stooped over posture. You know, a lot of people do anyways. In fact, I do, if I'm not careful, it's easy for me to be kind of forward, you know, I'm sitting a lot. I'm on planes a lot. I'm whatever. But in Parkinson's, it tends to be a little more exaggerated, but also the number one non-motor symptom is depression. So depressed people don't usually walk with really super upright posture and a confident gait. Yeah. But one of the things we've found to be helpful, is when we, when we cue them into gradually, we have kind of a process I like to go through to create more of a gradual awareness of what they can be moving like versus what they usually move like. And putting in some arm swing initiated from the shoulder joint, a little bit of reciprocal arm swing, plus some trunk rotation automatically brings you a little bit more upright. And then when they walk, more upright, and I call it like walking like a badass or walking with an attitude because you can't, you're not going to walk around all upright if you're depressed. But if you can start to get into more upright position, velocity increases, usually stability improves a little. And you know what, they just start to feel a little bit better. Like, oh, it feels good. So that totally makes sense about how each one of them affects each. Emotions affect movement, movement can affect emotions. Yep. Yep. And I'm bringing back memories again. Whenever I was studying as a kid for exams, I used to study late at night and occasionally I couldn't, to let myself go to sleep after studying, I had to go for a walk and I had a recording of Isao Tomita's, kind of the Jean-Michel Jarre kind of equivalent in Japanese. But he had a Holst Planet Suite, all on synthesizer. So I used to go for a walk around the countryside at two o'clock in the morning, listening to this, the Holst Planet Suite. And I would sometimes go through those different kind of moods. So each planet had a different mood. And I'm kind of thinking of the Mars sequence and it's very, it's very martial. It's very upright. It's very confident. It's very strident. There's an overlap of language and physicality, motion to be strident, to stride out, to be strong. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I'm going a little off track here, but I'm going back to New York City because it's very interesting to see the difference in different cultures and movement, cities and movement. Of course, you've seen that probably more than anyone. You do a lot of traveling. Quite a bit. I do a lot of traveling, but you go a lot of places. Yeah. Thankfully, I'm slowly done. Yeah. So it's interesting, like in New York City, you're right. There's this herd thing and you have to stand your ground. The way you said that is so appropriate because otherwise you're going to get run over. Same thing when you're driving in New York City. I mean, you know, that's why I take Uber. Or subway. But versus, let's say, going to pretty much anywhere else. Right? So I guess that kind of also makes me wonder how much society has to do with movement. Like where you live, does that affect your movement? Like subconsciously, you just take on certain movement of a certain where you are. Yeah. Oh, there's so much to talk about with that. Once upon a time, I was working with another teacher. And he had a particular walk. He's very bendy, but a very strong guy. And he had a particular kind of wavy walk. It was very particular to him. And he had a child, a little boy. And we had a big meeting once. And we were kind of hanging out after the meeting in the bar. And he was playing with this kid. And eventually, it was 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. Okay, it's bedtime. And so we watched him. Leaning his little boy across the dance floor and across kind of in front of the bar, back off to the hotel room. And you can see both of them moving in exactly the same particular way. So there's a level of influences in the style of movement I want to. As a kid, your input, how do I move, is kind of the first strongest influence is going to be parents. So I get to see my parents. How do we walk? And then, especially as teenagers, there's going to be a certain culture. And I don't know about you, but whenever you were growing up, for me, it was kind of sort of modern rockers. They had a different style of dress and a little bit of different movement. As a rocker, you had to have a certain, again, certain attitude. And I grew up close to Belfast. So during the 70s and 80s, there was the Troubles and the conflict between the Protestant and Catholic. And every 12th of July, the Protestants would put on lots of parades and kind of show their supposed dominance and superiority. And they would walk in the street. You could tell that you were getting close to that time when a certain section would start kind of walking with their shoulders up and their elbows out. And that was my first kind of impression. Then traveling around, a little bit more around through England, I thought, actually, there's a kind of like there's a New York walk. There's a London walk. I think there was a Boston walk as well. It's a little more uptight, a little bit more contained, a little less space than the New Yorkers. New Yorkers, you have to fight for your space. And maybe around Liverpool, there's a kind of, there's a very strong sea influence. So there's a little bit more of a, a role to their walk. And, you know, so was the whole kind of the Beatles and the music is really important. So I do think different, different cultures, different cities, different energies, musical influences, cultural influences.
