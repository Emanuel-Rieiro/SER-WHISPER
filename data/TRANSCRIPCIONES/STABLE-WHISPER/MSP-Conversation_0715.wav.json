{"text": " in the institution, he has, like, all these kids. Yeah, it's not really an institution so much as there's, like, a wing in the hospital. It was a little confusing because it seemed to be, like, where Scully worked. But it wasn't. But, like, it wasn't quite, but, like, it's sort of... No, because Scully's hospital looks really, like, gross and sad and, like, it's totally different. But it was, like, she went to Dolores Herbig to get connected to this guy who's doing this experiment. Yeah, but he gives money to their hospital. It's not the same. And this place, like, has all these children who have all these kind of genetic abnormalities and defects and things. Right. Which, the makeup on that stuff was crazy. It was. It was really tough. And, like, again, don't forget, Scully does all these surgeries on kids who are born without ears and puts ears on them, I guess. She just does great Scully things. Well, I mean, that's important, guys. She's a medical doctor. And that's sad. Yes, she is. Which is that he goes, you do these surgeries on these kids who have no ears till they look like alien babies. Oh, yeah, right. Remember that? Because it's, you know... Yeah, they have... And that was kind of important to her dreams in this episode. Right. Which we will talk about. That was kind of one of the best parts of the episode. I agree. Do you want to do your favorite part? Did we say the story enough? We have to talk about the... Well, is that part of your favorite part? That's why we shouldn't talk about what we... You were just mentioning about Scully? Yeah. I mean, well, I feel like we didn't quite finish with the description of the episode, which was the brother of this girl who's... Of the sister who is institutionalized under her, I guess, dad's control is looking for her. Right. And, I mean, he's the one that's making people hear the weird stuff. So, like, when he's near... Like, Mulder and Scully are investigating. Yeah, they go to this apartment. And the kid is nearby. And it starts happening to Mulder, which is, like, super great. Because I love when stupid stuff happens to Mulder. And Scully has to be the one that's like, what's happening? But it was weird because the effect was very similar to when he had, like, this brain thing, which led... In season seven, led to the need for him to have the surgery. But there was, like, multiple episodes where Mulder was, like, running around. And then suddenly he was, like, completely on the ground because he was having these crazy headaches or whatever. So this was very... Like, I was like, oh, does this have to do with his... They put alien stuff in his brain? They cut out part of his brain. They were going to, like, try to cut out part of it. Yeah. I mean, whatever. I thought it had to do with way more than it actually did, which this was not related. No, I didn't mean to do it. This was not related. It was just this kid. It was just this weird X-Men kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then at the end of the episode, I loved the scene where, like, the brother and the sister are reunited. And they bust out of the thing. And they vanish. Yeah, they both have crazy powers. And they, like, were totally, like, the brother and sister. They were the brother and sister from the Folgers commercial if they were crazy X-Men kids. And they were very, like, shippy at the end. And they, as classic X-Files Monster of the Weeks go, escaped. Yep. Because they never really saw them. They never saw them. So, yeah, so these kids, like we mentioned before, they got these, you know, abilities from being experimented on in utero, I guess. Yeah. Which leads to Mulder having this conversation with Scully. About, like, their mom being, like, an incubator. Yeah. And, like, he starts talking about his government, you know, stuff again. And Scully says to him, is that, like, what you thought happened to me? Like, was I just an incubator? Yeah. Which leads to, like, the, I guess, MSR-iest line of the night. Which was when he said to Scully that she's never just anything to him. Which was very nice. And the conversation was referring to their kid, William. Yeah. Who did have these powers based on all the alien-human hybrid experimentation. Yeah. That I do believe Spender, was it Spender? Was he still around? What about Spender? Took away. Oh, he did? He tried, or he thought he did. I don't know. With, like, some kind of injecty thing. But, like, maybe, maybe not. I don't know. We'll find out when we see William again. Because we will. I, just thinking about this now, both of these episodes, and I'm assuming literally throughout the rest of this season, will have to do with alien, or pregnancies and alien experimentation. A la Scully, a la William. The were-monster episode? I don't know if that one will. But the more, whenever it will touch upon mythology. Just kind of have it. Like, the first one dealt with abduction and pregnancy, and alien DNA experiments. Right. Second one deals with babies who have powers. Yeah. And again, via alien genetic, like, DNA put into them. And Scully tested her DNA in the first one, and all that stuff. Yeah. I mean, it's clearly leading up to, I mean, he's such a loose end. I know. I thought it would be really ballsy if they do never see him again. Me too. But I don't think that's gonna happen. Well, it's interesting that this episode was supposed to be the fifth one. Yeah. Which means that when this was written and filmed and made, there was only one episode after it. So, in this episode, they do not see or know anything about William, which leaves the, him only being able to be in or mentioned or seen in the very last one. Well, I'm not saying it could be this one. There's only six episodes here, but I'm talking about that season 11, or, you know, like... If they do more. Yeah. Okay. Obviously, for, you bring the X-Files back, you can't not touch upon William, because that's this huge thing that happened at the end of the show that wasn't mentioned in the subsequent movie, you know what I mean? Like, or was it? I can't remember. Which? In I Want to Believe. Sort of. Okay, well, clearly that's a huge thing for these two characters. I did have a problem with how Mulder didn't, like, consider him his, his own son. In this episode? Yeah, he was like, you're our son, Tuscully, or whatever. But, like, I mean, he does, but he does, though, because... I mean, in his own, but, like, I mean, weirdly, Tuscully, he didn't quite... And then, but, what is she, she asks him, like, if he thinks about him, and his reply was, of course I do, but I feel like I had to put that behind me. So he's kind of, like... Okay. Been able to, like, put it in the past more than she has, I guess. Because he's a dude, or, and he can, I guess. I don't know. He's a dude. But obviously he hasn't, because what we haven't mentioned yet is, you know, they have this conversation about, like, you know, her pregnancy and giving him up, and then they both have different sort of daydream slash nightmares about raising him. Yeah. And they are great. Yeah, let's do this. Like, a normal, like, she's a mom bringing him to school, and, like, all this nice stuff, and she, like, is going to pick him up from school. And then he has, like, normal little boy, like, accident thing. Like, he, like, breaks his arm. You know, just normal stuff. And her moment where it sort of switches into this sort of nightmarish thing is that something is really wrong with him. And she sees him, like, his face is kind of turning into, like, an alien. Yeah. Like, quality. Which I think has to do with this thing that she keeps, like, as dreams are, you know, usually whatever you're doing IRL kind of seeps into your subconscious, you know. So, yeah. So, like, she's, that's what she does. And after Tad said that thing about, like, she never thought about that. She's like, these are just kids who need ears. And now Tad said the thing about how they look like aliens. And that's been planted in her subconscious. Yeah, totally. And she converted that into, like, oh, no, her son is an alien. Right. Also. Right. And then, also, not to get too deep into it, but Emily, who was her biological child as well, also had, like, horrible things wrong with her. And she lost that child. So, yeah. And so that's already part of, like, her horrible backstory. Yeah. So, like, that. Her nightmare would encompass something horribly wrong happening to William as well. Yeah. It was sad. And also, she's, you know, obviously, like, a doctor. But the thing that's, I think you are obviously meant to think about Emily because at least the two kids from the episode, number one, are a boy and a girl. And I sometimes forget that Emily was Scully's child. Right. Because you're, like, so. I mean, it's two episodes. It's so quick. Yeah. And she, I mean, to be fair, like, the difference is that this was from, they took her ovary, or her egg, and they created Emily away from her. Right. She was pregnant with William. Yes. And that was, like, a whole long season. You know, like, you saw a lot more of that. Yeah. Like, so she didn't know that, like, Emily was hers. Right. And so you kind of forget that, like, she had two kids, technically. Yeah. Yeah. It's very easy to not remember that because it's not meant to be. It's mentioned super often. She doesn't go, oh, Emily, or whatever. Yeah. You know, like. But, yeah, you were, I think, because of the fact that there were these two kids in this episode and this whole conversation or whatever. Well, that's what's so great about the two kids. Sorry, no. No, I'm just, it's the same thing. Like, you were supposed to think about this. It's great, too, because the brother or sister also is for Mulder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two. Yeah. It's both. Which is kind of what is his daydream about William. Which I talked about Scully. So you want to talk about his. Um, I don't, first they're playing a sport. Yeah. Is that, is that what, they're doing a dad, son thing. They're playing, like, a sketch. Yeah, and they do, like, the rocket thing. Oh, they do that. They don't do a sport. They do rockets going to the moon. Yeah, they're setting up a rocket and he does JFK's speech. Right. So that's important because Cindy. Space. Space, aliens, I guess, or whatever. Um, I don't, the thing that I very vividly remember then that turns into, uh, is there a next part to this? There's three parts. What's the second part? I know the last part. They are very adorably on the couch together watching 2001. Oh, right. Yes. They're watching the part with the monolith. Right. Uh, having some popcorn, being really cute. Yeah, and he's like, the monolith could be interpreted as alien technology coming or, you know, he's getting aliens. The nicest, the nice part about that scene is when he says to him, uh, you know, people have this, this interpretation or this interpretation and then he says, like, uh, you'll have your own ideas about it someday. Like, I really liked that. That's nice fun. Yeah. Yeah. So what really cemented this one, uh, for me, of course, was the third part of this, which was then he hears him calling in his room and, and he runs in and he's being abducted via visually the same way that Samantha was. Right. The exact same way. Exact same way. Through, like, the window. The window. Like, he's. Like, floating. Yeah. Like, the horizontally. Yeah, yeah. Like, floating across, like, really memorable. Yeah. Image. And Mulder can't do anything the same way. And, of course, that would be his nightmare. Yeah. For what would happen to William. And that is so great. Like, that, this, these two things, this is what you want. Yeah. From shows. Because, like, this, these two things are what's the most, like, important to these people. Yes. Like, of course, they would interpret this one thing in those ways. Different ways. Yeah. And, but, like, both, but that they both have this, you know, nice vision of, like, maybe having been able to raise him. Normalcy. Yeah. But, like, they both are unable to kind of, like, follow it through. And they both have, they, both visions of them raising this kid end with, like, this horrible alien thing happening to him. Yeah. It's like two nightmares. But they're still, like, connected to the personal, like, backstories of Scully and Mulder separately. That it was just, like, A+. That was A+. No, for real. For real. And full of, just full of backstory for these two people from all the previous show, like, the previous seasons of the show. It's just, it's, these two people have really rich lives. Yeah. At this point. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So great. Too many things have happened. Yeah. But, I mean, it's so great to see that. Like, it's so great that at least, at least that wasn't, you know, mentioned. Like, nobody was like, oh, Mulder, your sister was abducted. Right. To kind of remind people, like, that was just there visually for people who know who Mulder is and why that is such an image for him. Awesome. So that was my favorite part. Oh, we're in favorite parts now? I mean, I'm just saying that was, since we're talking about it. Yeah. My favorite part was when that lady threw the ball at the cat. It was just so, it was just quintessential funny, X-Files beat. It just, everything felt so right about this episode. And I'm not even saying that it was, like, the best episode of the X-Files. It was like, if this was on when the X-Files was on, you'd be like, that was, that was right. That was a good episode. But, like, I feel like it was just, like, because it's now and the first one was so terrible. It was, like, it just, and everything felt so good about it that, like, I'm freaking out about how good it was. But it was just, like, it was, like, a good episode. And, like, I would definitely, like, I would, wouldn't rank it, like, among the best. But it was just, like, it was just so good. We didn't talk about that weird. To have it be, like, back to form. We didn't talk about that weird thing with the birds. Oh, that the birds that were always around when the bad, the kid was doing. There's a cool image of Scully running through them. Yeah, she ran and they all flew away. Yeah. Yeah. It was when Mulder was having another, like, sound attack from the, like, kid being nearby. Well, they came to the kid's house. Yeah. And his mom, who's, who's, like, fell down the stairs. Who's, like, a foster mom. No, she's not a foster. She's, like, his adopted mom. Which, again, because Scully and, you know, they gave him up for adoption. So, William, that is. So, they come to this kid's house and this, his new mom is trying to protect him. And, like, that's where Scully runs through the birds because she knows he's doing something. Right. With his mind. Yeah, and that looked really cool. Yeah. All the birds just flew. That was your favorite part. No, I just remember that that was a really good part. Visual. Really? Cool. Uh, Leigh's favorite part? Um, I don't know. I, you know what? To be perfectly honest with you, I wrote something, but you just convinced me that it was good. So. What? Oh, now I want to know. I, because I reacted way more to Mulder's dream than Scully's dream. Oh. So. Interesting. Your least favorite part was Scully's dream? Yeah. Huh. But I totally changed my mind then. Why initially did you not like it? Because the image of, uh, the image of William being abducted and Mulder being helpless was just so perfect. It's really vivid. And so, like, you're like, oh, of course, that for Scully having him be. It was a little more. It was a little bit like, oh, he looks silly because he's an alien boy now. And also, like, it just. When you add in the Emily part. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and the, you know, and the, and the thing with the, what, you know, her surgeries and Tad and all that stuff. Like, that becomes good. It's just not immediately as like, whoa, I see what you're doing, X-Files, as Mulder's dream. Yeah. And I think it was like, hers was the first one. Yeah. So it was kind of like, what's happening? Because, like, it's, it was not like she fell asleep or anything. It was just like. Yeah, that's it. It wasn't. It was weirdly, like, done where, like, they were just kind of sitting there thinking about it. Yeah. But it was also, like, weirdly filmed, like, um, the Sarah Connor Chronicle dream in the pilot. Oh. But not really. Uh. Interesting. And half of the time you're focused on her hair, you know. Oh, yeah. That's just what you do. Well, that flashback wig was straight and it looked better. It was, yeah, it was different. It was styled in the old school way. Yeah. Oh, not even. It was just, like, straight and, like, down. I think it was supposed to look like her season nine hair. Okay. But that was, had layers. Okay. But, like, I guess a little bit later it wouldn't. That's really where it was set, I guess. Okay. Oh, my gosh. Cool. Did you have, did you say your least faves? Least? Did I? Did you? Did I? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. I enjoyed the crap out of it so much and I had such a good time that, like, I don't know what to be, like, negative about. I, okay, my least favorite part is that Scully got flown across the room and knocked unconscious during the climax. Oh, yeah. That was another. That happened to her a lot in the past and doesn't need to happen. Yeah. She's gonna get, like, a concussion or something. That was another funny moment, like, old school moment where that stunt was, like, so funny and, like, oh, there's the stunt doubles kind of thing. But I shouldn't make fun because apparently their stunt coordinator is a lady. So. Excellent. Shush me. Excellent. But, no, I mean, being thrown across the room can look awkward. It's awkward. Yeah. That's, like, not a bad thing, actually. But it was just, like, no, don't be unconscious. Like, because she was, like, first to get, like, thrown. Yeah, she got thrown first. And, like, so it was just one of those things where you're, like, oh, she's down for the count. Oh, no. Classic Scully. So I guess that was my least favorite part. Well, are you looking forward to the other four? Yeah, I'm all in, of course. And next Monday, or, well, actually, when this is up and will have already aired. Yeah. Is the Darren Morgan episode. Mulder and Scully meet the weremonster. And from what the, like, pre-airing criticism chatter is that it's, like, another, like, great episode from Darren Morgan who only wrote, like, the best episodes of the X-Files ever. So I'm super excited. I'm, like, crazy excited to watch this episode. It's going to be good. Yeah. It's going to be so good. I can't wait. It's going to be very different from these two. That's for sure, though, as well. And then I'm a little wary. of the next one after that. You know way too much about what's happening. It's called Home Again. Oh, that's it already? Yeah. Which is not, apparently, had anything to do with home. It shouldn't have been called that. It does mention, well, didn't it, like, in some way it's going to, like, reference it somehow? Oh, really? I don't know. I thought Olivia was saying that. Wow. But I have no idea where that intel is from. But the description sounds great. But it's also going to be, like, upsetting because, it has more stuff to do with, like, Scully...", "segments": [{"start": 0.08, "end": 2.1, "text": " in the institution, he has, like, all these

Yeah, it's not really an institution so much as there's, like, a wing in the hospital. It was a little confusing because it seemed to be, like, where Scully worked. But it wasn't. But, like, it wasn't quite, but, like, it's sort of... No, because Scully's hospital looks really, like, gross and sad and, like, it's totally different. But it was, like, she went to Dolores Herbig to get connected to this guy who's doing this experiment. Yeah, but he gives money to their hospital. It's not the same. And this place, like, has all these children who have all these kind of genetic abnormalities and defects and things. Right. Which, the makeup on that stuff was crazy. It was. It was really tough. And, like, again, don't forget, Scully does all these surgeries on kids who are born without ears and puts ears on them, I guess. She just does great Scully things. Well, I mean, that's important, guys. She's a medical doctor. And that's sad. Yes, she is. Which is that he goes, you do these surgeries on these kids who have no ears till they look like alien babies. Oh, yeah, right. Remember that? Because it's, you know... Yeah, they have... And that was kind of important to her dreams in this episode. Right. Which we will talk about. That was kind of one of the best parts of the episode. I agree. Do you want to do your favorite part? Did we say the story enough? We have to talk about the... Well, is that part of your favorite part? That's why we shouldn't talk about what we... You were just mentioning about Scully? Yeah. I mean, well, I feel like we didn't quite finish with the description of the episode, which was the brother of this girl who's... Of the sister who is institutionalized under her, I guess, dad's control is looking for her. Right. And, I mean, he's the one that's making people hear the weird stuff. So, like, when he's near... Like, Mulder and Scully are investigating. Yeah, they go to this apartment. And the kid is nearby. And it starts happening to Mulder, which is, like, super great. Because I love when stupid stuff happens to Mulder. And Scully has to be the one that's like, what's happening? But it was weird because the effect was very similar to when he had, like, this brain thing, which led... In season seven, led to the need for him to have the surgery. But there was, like, multiple episodes where Mulder was, like, running around. And then suddenly he was, like, completely on the ground because he was having these crazy headaches or whatever. So this was very... Like, I was like, oh, does this have to do with his... They put alien stuff in his brain? They cut out part of his brain. They were going to, like, try to cut out part of it. Yeah. I mean, whatever. I thought it had to do with way more than it actually did, which this was not related. No, I didn't mean to do it. This was not related. It was just this kid. It was just this weird X-Men kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then at the end of the episode, I loved the scene where, like, the brother and the sister are reunited. And they bust out of the thing. And they vanish. Yeah, they both have crazy powers. And they, like, were totally, like, the brother and sister. They were the brother and sister from the Folgers commercial if they were crazy X-Men kids. And they were very, like, shippy at the end. And they, as classic X-Files Monster of the Weeks go, escaped. Yep. Because they never really saw them. They never saw them. So, yeah, so these kids, like we mentioned before, they got these, you know, abilities from being experimented on in utero, I guess. Yeah. Which leads to Mulder having this conversation with Scully. About, like, their mom being, like, an incubator. Yeah. And, like, he starts talking about his government, you know, stuff again. And Scully says to him, is that, like, what you thought happened to me? Like, was I just an incubator? Yeah. Which leads to, like, the, I guess, MSR-iest line of the night. Which was when he said to Scully that she's never just anything to him. Which was very nice. And the conversation was referring to their kid, William. Yeah. Who did have these powers based on all the alien-human hybrid experimentation. Yeah. That I do believe Spender, was it Spender? Was he still around? What about Spender? Took away. Oh, he did? He tried, or he thought he did. I don't know. With, like, some kind of injecty thing. But, like, maybe, maybe not. I don't know. We'll find out when we see William again. Because we will. I, just thinking about this now, both of these episodes, and I'm assuming literally throughout the rest of this season, will have to do with alien, or pregnancies and alien experimentation. A la Scully, a la William. The were-monster episode? I don't know if that one will. But the more, whenever it will touch upon mythology. Just kind of have it. Like, the first one dealt with abduction and pregnancy, and alien DNA experiments. Right. Second one deals with babies who have powers. Yeah. And again, via alien genetic, like, DNA put into them. And Scully tested her DNA in the first one, and all that stuff. Yeah. I mean, it's clearly leading up to, I mean, he's such a loose end. I know. I thought it would be really ballsy if they do never see him again. Me too. But I don't think that's gonna happen. Well, it's interesting that this episode was supposed to be the fifth one. Yeah. Which means that when this was written and filmed and made, there was only one episode after it. So, in this episode, they do not see or know anything about William, which leaves the, him only being able to be in or mentioned or seen in the very last one. Well, I'm not saying it could be this one. There's only six episodes here, but I'm talking about that season 11, or, you know, like... If they do more. Yeah. Okay. Obviously, for, you bring the X-Files back, you can't not touch upon William, because that's this huge thing that happened at the end of the show that wasn't mentioned in the subsequent movie, you know what I mean? Like, or was it? I can't remember. Which? In I Want to Believe. Sort of. Okay, well, clearly that's a huge thing for these two characters. I did have a problem with how Mulder didn't, like, consider him his, his own son. In this episode? Yeah, he was like, you're our son, Tuscully, or whatever. But, like, I mean, he does, but he does, though, because... I mean, in his own, but, like, I mean, weirdly, Tuscully, he didn't quite... And then, but, what is she, she asks him, like, if he thinks about him, and his reply was, of course I do, but I feel like I had to put that behind me. So he's kind of, like... Okay. Been able to, like, put it in the past more than she has, I guess. Because he's a dude, or, and he can, I guess. I don't know. He's a dude. But obviously he hasn't, because what we haven't mentioned yet is, you know, they have this conversation about, like, you know, her pregnancy and giving him up, and then they both have different sort of daydream slash nightmares about raising him. Yeah. And they are great. Yeah, let's do this. Like, a normal, like, she's a mom bringing him to school, and, like, all this nice stuff, and she, like, is going to pick him up from school. And then he has, like, normal little boy, like, accident thing. Like, he, like, breaks his arm. You know, just normal stuff. And her moment where it sort of switches into this sort of nightmarish thing is that something is really wrong with him. And she sees him, like, his face is kind of turning into, like, an alien. Yeah. Like, quality. Which I think has to do with this thing that she keeps, like, as dreams are, you know, usually whatever you're doing IRL kind of seeps into your subconscious, you know. So, yeah. So, like, she's, that's what she does. And after Tad said that thing about, like, she never thought about that. She's like, these are just kids who need ears. And now Tad said the thing about how they look like aliens. And that's been planted in her subconscious. Yeah, totally. And she converted that into, like, oh, no, her son is an alien. Right. Also. Right. And then, also, not to get too deep into it, but Emily, who was her biological child as well, also had, like, horrible things wrong with her. And she lost that child. So, yeah. And so that's already part of, like, her horrible backstory. Yeah. So, like, that. Her nightmare would encompass something horribly wrong happening to William as well. Yeah. It was sad. And also, she's, you know, obviously, like, a doctor. But the thing that's, I think you are obviously meant to think about Emily because at least the two kids from the episode, number one, are a boy and a girl. And I sometimes forget that Emily was Scully's child. Right. Because you're, like, so. I mean, it's two episodes. It's so quick. Yeah. And she, I mean, to be fair, like, the difference is that this was from, they took her ovary, or her egg, and they created Emily away from her. Right. She was pregnant with William. Yes. And that was, like, a whole long season. You know, like, you saw a lot more of that. Yeah. Like, so she didn't know that, like, Emily was hers. Right. And so you kind of forget that, like, she had two kids, technically. Yeah. Yeah. It's very easy to not remember that because it's not meant to be. It's mentioned super often. She doesn't go, oh, Emily, or whatever. Yeah. You know, like. But, yeah, you were, I think, because of the fact that there were these two kids in this episode and this whole conversation or whatever. Well, that's what's so great about the two kids. Sorry, no. No, I'm just, it's the same thing. Like, you were supposed to think about this. It's great, too, because the brother or sister also is for Mulder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two. Yeah. It's both. Which is kind of what is his daydream about William. Which I talked about Scully. So you want to talk about his. Um, I don't, first they're playing a sport. Yeah. Is that, is that what, they're doing a dad, son thing. They're playing, like, a sketch. Yeah, and they do, like, the rocket thing. Oh, they do that. They don't do a sport. They do rockets going to the moon. Yeah, they're setting up a rocket and he does JFK's speech. Right. So that's important because Cindy. Space. Space, aliens, I guess, or whatever. Um, I don't, the thing that I very vividly remember then that turns into, uh, is there a next part to this? There's three parts. What's the second part? I know the last part. They are very adorably on the couch together watching 2001. Oh, right. Yes. They're watching the part with the monolith. Right. Uh, having some popcorn, being really cute. Yeah, and he's like, the monolith could be interpreted as alien technology coming or, you know, he's getting aliens. The nicest, the nice part about that scene is when he says to him, uh, you know, people have this, this interpretation or this interpretation and then he says, like, uh, you'll have your own ideas about it someday. Like, I really liked that. That's nice fun. Yeah. Yeah. So what really cemented this one, uh, for me, of course, was the third part of this, which was then he hears him calling in his room and, and he runs in and he's being abducted via visually the same way that Samantha was. Right. The exact same way. Exact same way. Through, like, the window. The window. Like, he's. Like, floating. Yeah. Like, the horizontally. Yeah, yeah. Like, floating across, like, really memorable. Yeah. Image. And Mulder can't do anything the same way. And, of course, that would be his nightmare. Yeah. For what would happen to William. And that is so great. Like, that, this, these two things, this is what you want. Yeah. From shows. Because, like, this, these two things are what's the most, like, important to these people. Yes. Like, of course, they would interpret this one thing in those ways. Different ways. Yeah. And, but, like, both, but that they both have this, you know, nice vision of, like, maybe having been able to raise him. Normalcy. Yeah. But, like, they both are unable to kind of, like, follow it through. And they both have, they, both visions of them raising this kid end with, like, this horrible alien thing happening to him. Yeah. It's like two nightmares. But they're still, like, connected to the personal, like, backstories of Scully and Mulder separately. That it was just, like, A+. That was A+. No, for real. For real. And full of, just full of backstory for these two people from all the previous show, like, the previous seasons of the show. It's just, it's, these two people have really rich lives. Yeah. At this point. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So great. Too many things have happened. Yeah. But, I mean, it's so great to see that. Like, it's so great that at least, at least that wasn't, you know, mentioned. Like, nobody was like, oh, Mulder, your sister was abducted. Right. To kind of remind people, like, that was just there visually for people who know who Mulder is and why that is such an image for him. Awesome. So that was my favorite part. Oh, we're in favorite parts now? I mean, I'm just saying that was, since we're talking about it. Yeah. My favorite part was when that lady threw the ball at the cat. It was just so, it was just quintessential funny, X-Files beat. It just, everything felt so right about this episode. And I'm not even saying that it was, like, the best episode of the X-Files. It was like, if this was on when the X-Files was on, you'd be like, that was, that was right. That was a good episode. But, like, I feel like it was just, like, because it's now and the first one was so terrible. It was, like, it just, and everything felt so good about it that, like, I'm freaking out about how good it was. But it was just, like, it was, like, a good episode. And, like, I would definitely, like, I would, wouldn't rank it, like, among the best. But it was just, like, it was just so good. We didn't talk about that weird. To have it be, like, back to form. We didn't talk about that weird thing with the birds. Oh, that the birds that were always around when the bad, the kid was doing. There's a cool image of Scully running through them. Yeah, she ran and they all flew away. Yeah. Yeah. It was when Mulder was having another, like, sound attack from the, like, kid being nearby. Well, they came to the kid's house. Yeah. And his mom, who's, who's, like, fell down the stairs. Who's, like, a foster mom. No, she's not a foster. She's, like, his adopted mom. Which, again, because Scully and, you know, they gave him up for adoption. So, William, that is. So, they come to this kid's house and this, his new mom is trying to protect him. And, like, that's where Scully runs through the birds because she knows he's doing something. Right. With his mind. Yeah, and that looked really cool. Yeah. All the birds just flew. That was your favorite part. No, I just remember that that was a really good part. Visual. Really? Cool. Uh, Leigh's favorite part? Um, I don't know. I, you know what? To be perfectly honest with you, I wrote something, but you just convinced me that it was good. So. What? Oh, now I want to know. I, because I reacted way more to Mulder's dream than Scully's dream. Oh. So. Interesting. Your least favorite part was Scully's dream? Yeah. Huh. But I totally changed my mind then. Why initially did you not like it? Because the image of, uh, the image of William being abducted and Mulder being helpless was just so perfect. It's really vivid. And so, like, you're like, oh, of course, that for Scully having him be. It was a little more. It was a little bit like, oh, he looks silly because he's an alien boy now. And also, like, it just. When you add in the Emily part. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and the, you know, and the, and the thing with the, what, you know, her surgeries and Tad and all that stuff. Like, that becomes good. It's just not immediately as like, whoa, I see what you're doing, X-Files, as Mulder's dream. Yeah. And I think it was like, hers was the first one. Yeah. So it was kind of like, what's happening? Because, like, it's, it was not like she fell asleep or anything. It was just like. Yeah, that's it. It wasn't. It was weirdly, like, done where, like, they were just kind of sitting there thinking about it. Yeah. But it was also, like, weirdly filmed, like, um, the Sarah Connor Chronicle dream in the pilot. Oh. But not really. Uh. Interesting. And half of the time you're focused on her hair, you know. Oh, yeah. That's just what you do. Well, that flashback wig was straight and it looked better. It was, yeah, it was different. It was styled in the old school way. Yeah. Oh, not even. It was just, like, straight and, like, down. I think it was supposed to look like her season nine hair. Okay. But that was, had layers. Okay. But, like, I guess a little bit later it wouldn't. That's really where it was set, I guess. Okay. Oh, my gosh. Cool. Did you have, did you say your least faves? Least? Did I? Did you? Did I? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. I enjoyed the crap out of it so much and I had such a good time that, like, I don't know what to be, like, negative about. I, okay, my least favorite part is that Scully got flown across the room and knocked unconscious during the climax. Oh, yeah. That was another. That happened to her a lot in the past and doesn't need to happen. Yeah. She's gonna get, like, a concussion or something. That was another funny moment, like, old school moment where that stunt was, like, so funny and, like, oh, there's the stunt doubles kind of thing. But I shouldn't make fun because apparently their stunt coordinator is a lady. So. Excellent. Shush me. Excellent. But, no, I mean, being thrown across the room can look awkward. It's awkward. Yeah. That's, like, not a bad thing, actually. But it was just, like, no, don't be unconscious. Like, because she was, like, first to get, like, thrown. Yeah, she got thrown first. And, like, so it was just one of those things where you're, like, oh, she's down for the count. Oh, no. Classic Scully. So I guess that was my least favorite part. Well, are you looking forward to the other four? Yeah, I'm all in, of course. And next Monday, or, well, actually, when this is up and will have already aired. Yeah. Is the Darren Morgan episode. Mulder and Scully meet the weremonster. And from what the, like, pre-airing criticism chatter is that it's, like, another, like, great episode from Darren Morgan who only wrote, like, the best episodes of the X-Files ever. So I'm super excited. I'm, like, crazy excited to watch this episode. It's going to be good. Yeah. It's going to be so good. I can't wait. It's going to be very different from these two. That's for sure, though, as well. And then I'm a little wary. of the next one after that. You know way too much about what's happening. It's called Home Again. Oh, that's it already? Yeah. Which is not, apparently, had anything to do with home. It shouldn't have been called that. It does mention, well, didn't it, like, in some way it's going to, like, reference it somehow? Oh, really? I don't know. I thought Olivia was saying that. Wow. But I have no idea where that intel is from. But the description sounds great. But it's also going to be, like, upsetting because, it has more stuff to do with, like, Scully...", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.08, "end": 0.72, "text": " in the institution,", "seek": 0.0,
