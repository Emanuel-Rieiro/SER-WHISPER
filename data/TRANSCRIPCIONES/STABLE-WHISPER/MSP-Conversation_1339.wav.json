{"text": " As usual, every week when we check in, I'm doing it sitting right next to Sue Sierra Lupe from Occupy Medical, PracticalHerbalist.com, and Real Herbalism Radio. Hola, Health Crusaders. And over there in Wisconsin, we have our crazy wild radical activist, Johnny K. Dangers. Hey, hey, hey, everybody. Hey, hey, hey. I'm excited for this week's show. I'm excited. Sue's excited. And the cat in her lap, well, eh, not so excited. But that's okay. And y'all. That's so cat-like. It is. He is Sue's cat desk, is what he is. And I know, sometimes we just got to do the show with the cat desk. Yep. I have my lap. Does the cat have a name? Nero. I have my iPad resting on him as he sleeps. And he likes it that way. Yep. So now that y'all know about our cats, maybe y'all want to know about the show this week. And ISIS, apparently, which is the name of another one of our cats, oddly enough, ISIS has been getting amazing deals on Toyotas. And y'all never going to guess where they came from. And Doctors Without Borders has decided it's time to look into the war crimes. Of the United States. And over there in Copwatch, this is a good one for me to talk about because I am the NBA fan in this crowd. And Thabo Cephalosa went to court in New York and he came out a free man, which actually he wasn't likely to come out not a free man, but he did. And now the question is, will he sue the NYPD? God, I hope so. I do too. Also in Waco, where that big ass shootout happened, 170 people arrested. We'll let you know just how many of them actually are facing charges. It'll be a surprise. Yeah, it could almost be in bullshit. All right. But what does actually happen in bullshit this week, Johnny K? Yeah, in bullshit this week. Imagine this. Obama's going to Roseburg, Oregon after that terrible shooting. And you know what? He's greeted by armed Second Amendment, protesters. Completely unbelievable. So we're going to cover that. And what the fuck is going on with the GOP right now? It's an absolute shit show on who is going to be the third highest position in the entire country, the leader of the House. So we will talk about that. Well, there are so many good candidates amongst them. Yeah, they're all on my Christmas list too. In Healthcare Plus, the decline of Big Soda is finally starting to happen. I hear the death knell. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I'm listening for a pulse there and I'm not hearing too much. Forgotten History, we've got Indigenous Peoples Day. And in our absurd theater, it's Truth Serum. Woohoo. Yes. Now, we have spent so much time jibber-jabbering about what's going to happen on the show. We're not going to have much time for check-ins. So, Sue, the extremely 30 seconds or less abbreviated check-in from Occupy Medical. I got to tell you, I don't want it to be 30 seconds because it was an awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome greatness clinic. And one of the reasons why it was so wonderful is because I thought we were going to be short-staffed, but the opposite happened. We had a whole bunch of people show up from places that we hadn't seen them for a long time. They showed up. They helped out when we needed them most. And it was warm and fuzzy all over the place. In fact, we had people that had been coming as visitors and just sitting there and watching what we were doing, only coming in to get some food and basic stuff. And they seemed to warm to us. And a lot of folks came in and helped and showed a lot of pride in what they did too. And that feels good when you see people that have been beaten down by life have something that they feel good about. I think that's good. And J.K.D.? Yeah, this week, I'm excited. People were pretty happy. It seemed like we got an extra day of summer. And we had a good local 350 meeting. And tomorrow, when you guys listen to this, are you going to a Bernie debate party? Do you hate Bernie? Do you love Hillary? Are you going to watch the debate and get drunk off your ass? Who knows? But there's a lot of these going on, so I'm going to be heading to one. I'll let you know how it goes next week on the show. Sounds good. And now for Absurd Theater presenting Truth Serum. Lies that people don't even pretend to believe. Well, you are a congressman. I suspect that some of the lies are there to protect the public from things they are not ready to hear. It's not that simple, Father. I lie about campaign donations. I lie about emails. I've even been giving advice to others about lying. I was the one who told Volkswagen to blame the rogue engineer for the machinery they had been installing in their engines for the past five years. I mean, who would believe that? I can't help myself. It's ruining my life. Yes, that was a bad lie. But I think I can help you. As you know, priests and other members of the clergy cannot lie at all. And to help us, we get a truth serum injected into us occasionally to keep us from temptation. There is a visiting nurse here today who has a truth serum with her that she can inject into you and get you on the right path. Yeah, my drinking's not working so well. This truth serum? How will that help me? If you become accustomed to telling the truth with the serum, then when it wears off, you can choose when or when not to lie. As opposed to being addicted to lying. That is a great idea, Father. I saw that the nurses were volunteering here to help some of the homeless that you feed. She's here with the very thing I need. It must be God's will that I try it. God works in mysterious ways. Nurse? Yes, Father? Please come over here and bring your special serum. Serum? Um, the vaccine. Okay, I'll be right back. It's a vaccine? It guards against lies. Ah, here she comes now. Just sit here and roll up your sleeve. Okay, sir, I have a form for you to sign first. Uh, okay, uh, there you go. Sir, did you even read the form? Oh, yeah. For shame. Another lie. There you go again. Well, let's give him the serum. Okay, sir. Let me wipe the area and... All done. It's all over. Wow. I feel differently already. Ask me a question. Okay. Did you read the health form that I gave you? No, I didn't. In fact, I rarely read any forms or even any documents that I need to sign in Congress anyways. All that matters is if some big money guy is going to give me money. That's it. Hey, I did it. I told the truth. My turn. Why is Congress so eager to deny climate change? Well, mostly it's, uh, big payoffs. But they also said they built these really big arcs for us to live in, like 2012's a movie. This really is refreshing, but I could get into big trouble if this... kind of keep doing this. The truth will set you free, Congressman. Yeah, how long will the effects last? Oh, it's good for ten years, sir. Ten years? I can't keep this up for ten years. Think of what it'll do for my career. Think of what it'll do for my marriage. Oh, God. I gotta talk to my lawyer. My wife is going to fleece me for everything I've got. Ah! Uh, wow. I gotta say, Father, I've never seen anyone react to a tetanus vaccine like that before. Let's just keep this to ourselves, shall we? Patient confidentiality and all. Whatever you say, Father. Well, that was Tom Morello taking us out of that absurd little theater skit and into Freedom Fries. Yeah, I just want to thank Robert Strong for the conversation that led to the inception of that skit. He sort of gave us the seed for the skit. Mm-hmm. Yep. Well, I'd like to thank the congressman for giving us some fantastic blackmail potential for future NSA ring operations. Jim Jones, NSA agent to Chaos Theory Radio. Is that you? Who the hell else would it be? I'm a co-host on this show. Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. So that's our favorite NSA agent to Chaos Theory listeners. Yes, he's our favorite. Yeah. Yes, indeedy. Yes, indeedy. And that's Tom Morello fading off into the background. He's using our skits as blackmail? That's a little disturbing, isn't it? Yeah, you think you can go no lower, but... Hey. Yeah? You can go pretty deep. The earth is a deep place. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church. They've started protesting the weather. That's right. That's right. So, you know, that's where you're... That's the company... The weather is from God, not from wind. Yeah. It's not from the earth turning and things like air temperature. God doing it. Uh-huh. So they're... They are real life guys. They are actually protesting weather stations. That's true. That's true. But that is not... Oh, my God. Can you imagine listening to the NSA calls about them? Oh, man, the craziness. Yeah. It's not a fun job. I did one week. I asked for a new position. That's how we got you? You mean you went from Westboro Baptist to us? No. Stop in between, but kind of, yes. Now I really hate the Westboro Baptist Church. That... Wow. I... Okay, moving on. Moving on. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What was the next topic here? The next topic is... Now, listeners, you've all seen the videos, when maybe you haven't all seen them, because, you know, frankly, I don't know if I've seen them, but Toyota's brand new Toyota 4x4 is tooling around in the Syrian desert with guys with you know, rocket-powered, you know, rocket launchers and stuff like that. It's like the creepiest Toyota commercial they've ever put out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the Treasury Department was starting to wonder, what's up with all these Toyotas? How is ISIS getting all these Toyotas? So the U.S. Treasury Department was like, Japan, Toyota, you've got some splainin' to do. Yeah, well, except that Toyotas are, of course, made in the U.S. Yeah, well, you know. Because we're in a second-world country. They still went to Toyota to get the goods. They did. And Toyota was like, I don't know what you're talking about. I mean, sure, we've seen the videos, too, but we're not sending them over there. Yeah, and I'd like to say, Gachsu, why is your cat, ISIS, getting Toyotas from the government? And why aren't we getting any benefit from it? That's what I want to know. Yeah. Yeah, where's she parking those damn things? Because there's hundreds of Toyotas. Right. Yeah. So they'd actually. They just park all over the lawn. Oh. The neighbors are starting to complain. At least they're classy new ones. Uh-huh. So they're actually, they did a little more tracking. Uh-huh. And they found out that, well, you know, it's all, eh, sort of circumstantial evidence. Because it turns out the State Department has been sending over shipments of Toyotas to, you know, this was back when we were supporting the Free Syrian Army. Uh-huh. And like, hey, would you guys like guns? Would you guys like Toyotas? Well, they said. Would you guys like ice cream makers? They put out a shopping list, and they said, what we want, what we want is some Toyotas. And they said, oh, that's great. So us, the United States, and Britain. And the UK. Yeah. They sent them their little Christmas gift, a fleet of Toyota trucks. Oh, little UK Santa for ISIS. They didn't stop there, though. They sent them forklifts. They sent them these advanced resilience kits for region hubs that are designed to help people in emergencies. 130 solar-powered batteries, 400 radios, water purification and rubbish collection kits, laptops, VSATs. These are people that don't even celebrate Christmas, and they're getting Christmas. What's going on with that? And you know what? If we really wanted to take them down, we would have sent them a fleet of Pintos. But no. We are not smart. No. Not even anything made from Ford. Yeah. Yeah. And this is in the middle of the war on Christmas. In laptops? Yeah. In laptops, they got that red dot. I'm watching them. But maybe this is undercover. Also, originally, we had two popcorn machines that were supposed to be sent to the Syrian desert, and I took one of them. So one for America, zero ISIS. Actually, one. They have one of the popcorn machines. It's kind of one-one. It's a tie. A tie. Well, that'll show them. Yeah. Good job, Jim. Doing it without popcorn in the desert. That's rough on ISIS, I'll tell you. Fools. Uh-huh.

sitting right next to Sue Sierra Lupe from Occupy Medical, PracticalHerbalist.com, and Real Herbalism Radio. Hola, Health Crusaders. And over there in Wisconsin, we have our crazy wild radical activist, Johnny K. Dangers. Hey, hey, hey, everybody. Hey, hey, hey. I'm excited for this week's show. I'm excited. Sue's excited. And the cat in her lap, well, eh, not so excited. But that's okay. And y'all. That's so cat-like. It is. He is Sue's cat desk, is what he is. And I know, sometimes we just got to do the show with the cat desk. Yep. I have my lap. Does the cat have a name? Nero. I have my iPad resting on him as he sleeps. And he likes it that way. Yep. So now that y'all know about our cats, maybe y'all want to know about the show this week. And ISIS, apparently, which is the name of another one of our cats, oddly enough, ISIS has been getting amazing deals on Toyotas. And y'all never going to guess where they came from. And Doctors Without Borders has decided it's time to look into the war crimes. Of the United States. And over there in Copwatch, this is a good one for me to talk about because I am the NBA fan in this crowd. And Thabo Cephalosa went to court in New York and he came out a free man, which actually he wasn't likely to come out not a free man, but he did. And now the question is, will he sue the NYPD? God, I hope so. I do too. Also in Waco, where that big ass shootout happened, 170 people arrested. We'll let you know just how many of them actually are facing charges. It'll be a surprise. Yeah, it could almost be in bullshit. All right. But what does actually happen in bullshit this week, Johnny K? Yeah, in bullshit this week. Imagine this. Obama's going to Roseburg, Oregon after that terrible shooting. And you know what? He's greeted by armed Second Amendment, protesters. Completely unbelievable. So we're going to cover that. And what the fuck is going on with the GOP right now? It's an absolute shit show on who is going to be the third highest position in the entire country, the leader of the House. So we will talk about that. Well, there are so many good candidates amongst them. Yeah, they're all on my Christmas list too. In Healthcare Plus, the decline of Big Soda is finally starting to happen. I hear the death knell. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I'm listening for a pulse there and I'm not hearing too much. Forgotten History, we've got Indigenous Peoples Day. And in our absurd theater, it's Truth Serum. Woohoo. Yes. Now, we have spent so much time jibber-jabbering about what's going to happen on the show. We're not going to have much time for check-ins. So, Sue, the extremely 30 seconds or less abbreviated check-in from Occupy Medical. I got to tell you, I don't want it to be 30 seconds because it was an awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome greatness clinic. And one of the reasons why it was so wonderful is because I thought we were going to be short-staffed, but the opposite happened. We had a whole bunch of people show up from places that we hadn't seen them for a long time. They showed up. They helped out when we needed them most. And it was warm and fuzzy all over the place. In fact, we had people that had been coming as visitors and just sitting there and watching what we were doing, only coming in to get some food and basic stuff. And they seemed to warm to us. And a lot of folks came in and helped and showed a lot of pride in what they did too. And that feels good when you see people that have been beaten down by life have something that they feel good about. I think that's good. And J.K.D.? Yeah, this week, I'm excited. People were pretty happy. It seemed like we got an extra day of summer. And we had a good local 350 meeting. And tomorrow, when you guys listen to this, are you going to a Bernie debate party? Do you hate Bernie? Do you love Hillary? Are you going to watch the debate and get drunk off your ass? Who knows? But there's a lot of these going on, so I'm going to be heading to one. I'll let you know how it goes next week on the show. Sounds good. And now for Absurd Theater presenting Truth Serum. Lies that people don't even pretend to believe. Well, you are a congressman. I suspect that some of the lies are there to protect the public from things they are not ready to hear. It's not that simple, Father. I lie about campaign donations. I lie about emails. I've even been giving advice to others about lying. I was the one who told Volkswagen to blame the rogue engineer for the machinery they had been installing in their engines for the past five years. I mean, who would believe that? I can't help myself. It's ruining my life. Yes, that was a bad lie. But I think I can help you. As you know, priests and other members of the clergy cannot lie at all. And to help us, we get a truth serum injected into us occasionally to keep us from temptation. There is a visiting nurse here today who has a truth serum with her that she can inject into you and get you on the right path. Yeah, my drinking's not working so well. This truth serum? How will that help me? If you become accustomed to telling the truth with the serum, then when it wears off, you can choose when or when not to lie. As opposed to being addicted to lying. That is a great idea, Father. I saw that the nurses were volunteering here to help some of the homeless that you feed. She's here with the very thing I need. It must be God's will that I try it. God works in mysterious ways. Nurse? Yes, Father? Please come over here and bring your special serum. Serum? Um, the vaccine. Okay, I'll be right back. It's a vaccine? It guards against lies. Ah, here she comes now. Just sit here and roll up your sleeve. Okay, sir, I have a form for you to sign first. Uh, okay, uh, there you go. Sir, did you even read the form? Oh, yeah. For shame. Another lie. There you go again. Well, let's give him the serum. Okay, sir. Let me wipe the area and... All done. It's all over. Wow. I feel differently already. Ask me a question. Okay. Did you read the health form that I gave you? No, I didn't. In fact, I rarely read any forms or even any documents that I need to sign in Congress anyways. All that matters is if some big money guy is going to give me money. That's it. Hey, I did it. I told the truth. My turn. Why is Congress so eager to deny climate change? Well, mostly it's, uh, big payoffs. But they also said they built these really big arcs for us to live in, like 2012's a movie. This really is refreshing, but I could get into big trouble if this... kind of keep doing this. The truth will set you free, Congressman. Yeah, how long will the effects last? Oh, it's good for ten years, sir. Ten years? I can't keep this up for ten years. Think of what it'll do for my career. Think of what it'll do for my marriage. Oh, God. I gotta talk to my lawyer. My wife is going to fleece me for everything I've got. Ah! Uh, wow. I gotta say, Father, I've never seen anyone react to a tetanus vaccine like that before. Let's just keep this to ourselves, shall we? Patient confidentiality and all. Whatever you say, Father. Well, that was Tom Morello taking us out of that absurd little theater skit and into Freedom Fries. Yeah, I just want to thank Robert Strong for the conversation that led to the inception of that skit. He sort of gave us the seed for the skit. Mm-hmm. Yep. Well, I'd like to thank the congressman for giving us some fantastic blackmail potential for future NSA ring operations. Jim Jones, NSA agent to Chaos Theory Radio. Is that you? Who the hell else would it be? I'm a co-host on this show. Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. So that's our favorite NSA agent to Chaos Theory listeners. Yes, he's our favorite. Yeah. Yes, indeedy. Yes, indeedy. And that's Tom Morello fading off into the background. He's using our skits as blackmail? That's a little disturbing, isn't it? Yeah, you think you can go no lower, but... Hey. Yeah? You can go pretty deep. The earth is a deep place. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church. They've started protesting the weather. That's right. That's right. So, you know, that's where you're... That's the company... The weather is from God, not from wind. Yeah. It's not from the earth turning and things like air temperature. God doing it. Uh-huh. So they're... They are real life guys. They are actually protesting weather stations. That's true. That's true. But that is not... Oh, my God. Can you imagine listening to the NSA calls about them? Oh, man, the craziness. Yeah. It's not a fun job. I did one week. I asked for a new position. That's how we got you? You mean you went from Westboro Baptist to us? No. Stop in between, but kind of, yes. Now I really hate the Westboro Baptist Church. That... Wow. I... Okay, moving on. Moving on. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What was the next topic here? The next topic is... Now, listeners, you've all seen the videos, when maybe you haven't all seen them, because, you know, frankly, I don't know if I've seen them, but Toyota's brand new Toyota 4x4 is tooling around in the Syrian desert with guys with you know, rocket-powered, you know, rocket launchers and stuff like that. It's like the creepiest Toyota commercial they've ever put out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the Treasury Department was starting to wonder, what's up with all these Toyotas? How is ISIS getting all these Toyotas? So the U.S. Treasury Department was like, Japan, Toyota, you've got some splainin' to do. Yeah, well, except that Toyotas are, of course, made in the U.S. Yeah, well, you know. Because we're in a second-world country. They still went to Toyota to get the goods. They did. And Toyota was like, I don't know what you're talking about. I mean, sure, we've seen the videos, too, but we're not sending them over there. Yeah, and I'd like to say, Gachsu, why is your cat, ISIS, getting Toyotas from the government? And why aren't we getting any benefit from it? That's what I want to know. Yeah. Yeah, where's she parking those damn things? Because there's hundreds of Toyotas. Right. Yeah. So they'd actually. They just park all over the lawn. Oh. The neighbors are starting to complain. At least they're classy new ones. Uh-huh. So they're actually, they did a little more tracking. Uh-huh. And they found out that, well, you know, it's all, eh, sort of circumstantial evidence. Because it turns out the State Department has been sending over shipments of Toyotas to, you know, this was back when we were supporting the Free Syrian Army. Uh-huh. And like, hey, would you guys like guns? Would you guys like Toyotas? Well, they said. Would you guys like ice cream makers? They put out a shopping list, and they said, what we want, what we want is some Toyotas. And they said, oh, that's great. So us, the United States, and Britain. And the UK. Yeah. They sent them their little Christmas gift, a fleet of Toyota trucks. Oh, little UK Santa for ISIS. They didn't stop there, though. They sent them forklifts. They sent them these advanced resilience kits for region hubs that are designed to help people in emergencies. 130 solar-powered batteries, 400 radios, water purification and rubbish collection kits, laptops, VSATs. These are people that don't even celebrate Christmas, and they're getting Christmas. What's going on with that? And you know what? If we really wanted to take them down, we would have sent them a fleet of Pintos. But no. We are not smart. No. Not even anything made from Ford. Yeah. Yeah. And this is in the middle of the war on Christmas. In laptops? Yeah. In laptops, they got that red dot. I'm watching them. But maybe this is undercover. Also, originally, we had two popcorn machines that were supposed to be sent to the Syrian desert, and I took one of them. So one for America, zero ISIS. Actually, one. They have one of the popcorn machines. It's kind of one-one. It's a tie. A tie. Well, that'll show them. Yeah. Good job, Jim. Doing it without popcorn in the desert.
