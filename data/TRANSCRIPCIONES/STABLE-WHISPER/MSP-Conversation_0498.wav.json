{"text": " oh well it's got a lot of things going for it i mean like but the main thing is that you know we've said from the beginning that the kind of cop uh jake wants to be is the kind of cop holt was in the 70s and he's refining that into like he wants holt skills and he wants his mentorship and like if he's going to be solving a serial killer case holt is the best man to help him with that holt thinks in the same kind of bursts of inspiration as him and holt has put away some really big name killers jake used those lessons very very well and the amazing thing is that holt probably felt subconsciously but like immediately recognized that in jake and wanted to and was really happy to see him succeeding which makes this like a perfect family storyline because you know it's not at all secret that that holt is jake's father figure and this episode was like a rite of passage like jake being able to do the thing he admires about holt holt like helping him along with it taking him into his like confidences having a drink with him having a drink with your dad is very much uh wow i'm an adult now kind of feeling at least for a man i think sitting around and like talking with my dad over drinks is is a very meaningful thing for for me without having a lot of seriousness forced on that interaction and immediately like warped jake's perception of what is good to drink which i extra appreciate because the like first alcohol i got into was port and then i had to stop because like red wine makes me like violently hung over and super horrible port is fucking delicious but well it better be um given how it's made it's fucking great um it's uh i want some port i i loved that gina was like oh you're still drinking that and he's like well yeah i kind of love it they're they're partners no carl it's too yes he nailed it they said it did you miss that oh no they did when jake went like when they met on the bench jake said partner and holt said partner without missing a beat holt yes andy they had they had a silly in joke oh my god holt holt was holt was so much so much in this episode like his constant yes anding of jake was terrific and jake paid it forward to gina like there was so much mutual building up in this episode like these three people love each other they really do like this is a family unit this is unbreakable i love jake underlining he's like hey childhood friend who i've known forever in love with all my heart and i was like oh damn it jake but it's true i know also like him like aren't you for are you forgetting something in her action like he has no idea what she's talking about he's like is it is it the thing i'm gonna maybe kiss her on the forehead to leave and she's like no pay your bill not that thing the normal being in society do you god they're such siblings so perfect it's so great i just love that so much i love that forehead kiss i love how gift it's being right now yeah like it's uh it was it was it was a watershed moment it's a delight i love jake's entire face if there wasn't it's too good for this world okay cinnamon roll but like what if there were if there were a way to give somebody an emmy for doing great acting work in a comedy as opposed to like comedic acting work in a comedy this is the jake i want to see more of yeah he's so uh he likes his friend so much and like he's a good cop who wants to do his job even though he's not getting paid for it he like fucking puts his entire career like he's just like whatever this case would make me but whatever having hold back of the precinct is better for everyone including me and like doesn't sacrifice himself for it either fun but never deviates from being less irresponsible i i i struggle with straight up labeling jake as anything approaching responsible but he did go into a like live weapon situation with no backup so less irresponsible is correct yes he's grown as a person seriously still a rookie mistake um the though i will say holt doesn't look like he has backup in a lot of his flashbacks to catching criminal scenes holt was an irresponsible cop also true like but still i think my favorite thing in this episode is how relentlessly enthused jake is about rihanna's life but not how relentlessly enthused jake is about gina's life like she's like i'm taking a normal psychology class everyone is obsessed with me he's like smiling so big he's like yeah they should be and not just because you're weird i love that gina gives them the like criminal minds little like behavioral analysis run down there it was great what a great little moment gina would make an amazing criminal profiler like honestly yeah oh should we talk about jake being like amy gave me the sticker for waking up oh yeah we totally should that's a great tactic i agree i love that jake's like oh it's so hot i was like you're perfect that's a weird line on his part but like he's with a woman who like wants to take care of his emotions and is entirely sure how but that's a pretty canny move on amy's part or at least a move that demonstrates a pretty high emotional intelligence i love that well because jake prefaces it by being like i am straight up depressed amy gave me a sticker for waking up that's a good move that's so i can't get over how smart that is because like jake is basically childish whimsy as a person and stickers i fucking love stickers so so like he loves the cheap gratification and that is a good vehicle for him being told that like you know you got out of bed that's an accomplishment you're getting better jesus i just fucking loved this episode i loved it so much i feel like i can't even talk about it i don't know we also didn't plan so okay i i wonder if we'll see garmin again i think we i think we might i think we i think he might become an occasional recurring character because they've like i mean apparently over the summer they learned what a chief of detectives was which i can't throw shade i don't know what a chief of detectives is but like if he's someone who's in charge of detective stuff then they could have a lot of business with him they at least have an ally against wunsch now and if they keep getting through these really high profile cases then he could be a very good um conduit for career opportunities for the characters i was actually exactly going that direction because i was going to say that i believe major crime in in the actual nypd major crimes reports to the chief of directives detectives directly i wonder i hope we see the vulture again i'm sure we'll see the vulture i hope we see the vulture again this season i'm sure we'll see the vulture again this season i i actually i think he will probably be involved in the in the last arc of the season dude way to fucking read my mind we are so on level right now that's amazing i i have a feeling i i have a feeling that i don't think the wunsch stuff will be the season finale again um but i do think no i hope not yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of ready for them to sort of let that go for a while yeah yeah um speaking of letting stuff go for a while yeah we've been here for a while yeah you're saying we should let each other go for a while i'm saying that we should let the audience go to their rich and full lives hey audience if there's anything that we didn't cover that you want us to talk about send us an ask if you want us to talk about we'll probably answer it or talk about it in the next podcast it'll be like the opening before it'll be our pitter patter before we jump into halloween three pitter patter uh word of the week yeah maybe i'm just like really starved for rain it doesn't rain here at all yeah you and crops both that's that's how you joke about california right totally that's what i learned from from mars god did you see the martian yeah i did see the martian did you see uh crimson peak i did not see crimson so let's talk about the martian it's marketed like a horror film so i'm not going to see it it's definitely not a horror film that's cool they shouldn't have marketed it that way now i'm not going to see it got it uh it's a got the next time i see a movie it's going to be sicario really what the hell is that movie about i don't even understand i don't know but a lot of people whose opinions i respect say it's the best one of the year so i'm gonna go see it wow man i guess i should go see it i was hearing somebody being like i want to go see sicario i was like why though i think it's about emily blunt hunting a serial killer in northern mexico in a kind of like magical realism dream landscape holy shit that might be but i might have made all of that up except for emily blunt fair enough i feel like i feel like let's watch a trailer together and then decide what it's about after we finish recording no right now she's on the podcast yeah are you serious i'm going to youtube", "segments": [{"start": 0.66, "end": 4.42, "text": " oh well it's got a lot of

it's got a lot of things going for it i mean like but the main thing is that you know we've said from the beginning that the kind of cop uh jake wants to be is the kind of cop holt was in the 70s and he's refining that into like he wants holt skills and he wants his mentorship and like if he's going to be solving a serial killer case holt is the best man to help him with that holt thinks in the same kind of bursts of inspiration as him and holt has put away some really big name killers jake used those lessons very very well and the amazing thing is that holt probably felt subconsciously but like immediately recognized that in jake and wanted to and was really happy to see him succeeding which makes this like a perfect family storyline because you know it's not at all secret that that holt is jake's father figure and this episode was like a rite of passage like jake being able to do the thing he admires about holt holt like helping him along with it taking him into his like confidences having a drink with him having a drink with your dad is very much uh wow i'm an adult now kind of feeling at least for a man i think sitting around and like talking with my dad over drinks is is a very meaningful thing for for me without having a lot of seriousness forced on that interaction and immediately like warped jake's perception of what is good to drink which i extra appreciate because the like first alcohol i got into was port and then i had to stop because like red wine makes me like violently hung over and super horrible port is fucking delicious but well it better be um given how it's made it's fucking great um it's uh i want some port i i loved that gina was like oh you're still drinking that and he's like well yeah i kind of love it they're they're partners no carl it's too yes he nailed it they said it did you miss that oh no they did when jake went like when they met on the bench jake said partner and holt said partner without missing a beat holt yes andy they had they had a silly in joke oh my god holt holt was holt was so much so much in this episode like his constant yes anding of jake was terrific and jake paid it forward to gina like there was so much mutual building up in this episode like these three people love each other they really do like this is a family unit this is unbreakable i love jake underlining he's like hey childhood friend who i've known forever in love with all my heart and i was like oh damn it jake but it's true i know also like him like aren't you for are you forgetting something in her action like he has no idea what she's talking about he's like is it is it the thing i'm gonna maybe kiss her on the forehead to leave and she's like no pay your bill not that thing the normal being in society do you god they're such siblings so perfect it's so great i just love that so much i love that forehead kiss i love how gift it's being right now yeah like it's uh it was it was it was a watershed moment it's a delight i love jake's entire face if there wasn't it's too good for this world okay cinnamon roll but like what if there were if there were a way to give somebody an emmy for doing great acting work in a comedy as opposed to like comedic acting work in a comedy this is the jake i want to see more of yeah he's so uh he likes his friend so much and like he's a good cop who wants to do his job even though he's not getting paid for it he like fucking puts his entire career like he's just like whatever this case would make me but whatever having hold back of the precinct is better for everyone including me and like doesn't sacrifice himself for it either fun but never deviates from being less irresponsible i i i struggle with straight up labeling jake as anything approaching responsible but he did go into a like live weapon situation with no backup so less irresponsible is correct yes he's grown as a person seriously still a rookie mistake um the though i will say holt doesn't look like he has backup in a lot of his flashbacks to catching criminal scenes holt was an irresponsible cop also true like but still i think my favorite thing in this episode is how relentlessly enthused jake is about rihanna's life but not how relentlessly enthused jake is about gina's life like she's like i'm taking a normal psychology class everyone is obsessed with me he's like smiling so big he's like yeah they should be and not just because you're weird i love that gina gives them the like criminal minds little like behavioral analysis run down there it was great what a great little moment gina would make an amazing criminal profiler like honestly yeah oh should we talk about jake being like amy gave me the sticker for waking up oh yeah we totally should that's a great tactic i agree i love that jake's like oh it's so hot i was like you're perfect that's a weird line on his part but like he's with a woman who like wants to take care of his emotions and is entirely sure how but that's a pretty canny move on amy's part or at least a move that demonstrates a pretty high emotional intelligence i love that well because jake prefaces it by being like i am straight up depressed amy gave me a sticker for waking up that's a good move that's so i can't get over how smart that is because like jake is basically childish whimsy as a person and stickers i fucking love stickers so so like he loves the cheap gratification and that is a good vehicle for him being told that like you know you got out of bed that's an accomplishment you're getting better jesus i just fucking loved this episode i loved it so much i feel like i can't even talk about it i don't know we also didn't plan so okay i i wonder if we'll see garmin again i think we i think we might i think we i think he might become an occasional recurring character because they've like i mean apparently over the summer they learned what a chief of detectives was which i can't throw shade i don't know what a chief of detectives is but like if he's someone who's in charge of detective stuff then they could have a lot of business with him they at least have an ally against wunsch now and if they keep getting through these really high profile cases then he could be a very good um conduit for career opportunities for the characters i was actually exactly going that direction because i was going to say that i believe major crime in in the actual nypd major crimes reports to the chief of directives detectives directly i wonder i hope we see the vulture again i'm sure we'll see the vulture i hope we see the vulture again this season i'm sure we'll see the vulture again this season i i actually i think he will probably be involved in the in the last arc of the season dude way to fucking read my mind we are so on level right now that's amazing i i have a feeling i i have a feeling that i don't think the wunsch stuff will be the season finale again um but i do think no i hope not yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of ready for them to sort of let that go for a while yeah yeah um speaking of letting stuff go for a while yeah we've been here for a while yeah you're saying we should let each other go for a while i'm saying that we should let the audience go to their rich and full lives hey audience if there's anything that we didn't cover that you want us to talk about send us an ask if you want us to talk about we'll probably answer it or talk about it in the next podcast it'll be like the opening before it'll be our pitter patter before we jump into halloween three pitter patter uh word of the week yeah maybe i'm just like really starved for rain it doesn't rain here at all yeah you and crops both that's that's how you joke about california right totally that's what i learned from from mars god did you see the martian yeah i did see the martian did you see uh crimson peak i did not see crimson so let's talk about the martian it's marketed like a horror film so i'm not going to see it it's definitely not a horror film that's cool they shouldn't have marketed it that way now i'm not going to see it got it uh it's a got the next time i see a movie it's going to be sicario really what the hell is that movie about i don't even understand i don't know but a lot of people whose opinions i respect say it's the best one of the year so i'm gonna go see it wow man i guess i should go see it i was hearing somebody being like i want to go see sicario i was like why though i think it's about emily blunt hunting a serial killer in northern mexico in a kind of like magical realism dream landscape holy shit that might be but i might have made all of that up except for emily blunt fair enough i feel like i feel like let's watch a trailer together and then decide what it's about after
