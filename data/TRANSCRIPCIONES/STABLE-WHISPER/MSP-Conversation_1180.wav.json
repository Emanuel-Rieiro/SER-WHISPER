{"text": " Councilwoman Letitia James accepted that invitation. Regrettably, State Senator Daniel Squadron had a scheduling conflict. This is an important race, and we urge you to make plans to vote Tuesday, October 1st, in the runoff election for New York City public advocate. And to further inform your vote, we're joined now by Letitia James. And good evening. Good evening, and thank you for allowing me to speak to some of your listeners tonight. It's a very important election tomorrow. Well, indeed it is, and because it's so important, one of the things that I'm particularly interested in knowing and understanding is really, how does your career development, how does your, and it's really kind of a combination of circumstances here, because I'm concerned about time constraints, but the career development, you as a woman running in a key citywide political office where there are no other women in similar situations, and being an African American in a city that is now a majority population of people of color, how do these aspects of your life really inform your positions? And the role that you would like to see yourself play as public advocate? Well, Mimi, you know, I wasn't born with a golden spoon in my mouth. I was born in poverty. My mother scrubbed floors, my father was a janitor. And I can recall at an early age when my brother was arrested, falsely accused of a crime, my mother took me down to criminal court. And I always remember that everyone in the courtroom did not look like me other than the defendants. And I remember the court officers treating my mother with great disrespect, and they were very rude. And as a result of that, that sort of shaped and colored my views on the importance of education, one. And two, that I really wanted to serve and grow up and become an attorney and commit my life to social justice. And so that in the future, no other mother or grandmother or father or grandfather, when they came to court, just trying to find out where their child was, would ever be disrespected. So I just really wanted to change that picture. And as you know, I'm a graduate of Howard University, and they trained me not to just be an attorney, but to be a social engineer and commit my life to social justice. And so upon graduation, I worked for the Legal Aid Society. I was a criminal defense attorney. I was representing children and victims of domestic violence. I then went on to work in the state legislature as an attorney to Al Vann and Roger Green and a number of other progressive members of the legislature, focusing on issues affecting low-income communities and people of color. Then was a former assistant attorney general where we investigated stop and frisk within NYPD almost 15 years ago, and basically taking on businesses that engaged in deceptive business practices against vulnerable populations. And then the last 10 years, and as a member of the city council, you know, I've taken the Mayor Bloomberg on at every turn. From the extension of term limits, I challenged him with Bill de Blasio, went to court. Unsuccessful, but when the Democratic nominee, Bill Thompson at the time, was on the ballot, I worked like hell to try to get him elected, unlike my opponent who did not endorse him and did nothing for him. In fact, claims he was too busy. I challenged the administration on closing the child care slots, on overriding his veto of the abuses related to stop and frisk and banning racial profiling in the city of New York, his policies on the homeless, and his policies, you know, in the city of New York. You know, we've got income inequality, we've got the feminization of poverty. 52,000 individuals are living in our shelters this evening, a third of them are children. We just need to move past this administration, and we need a more progressive agenda, and that's why I'm running for public and I know I have challenges. Yes, I am a woman and a woman of color, and yes, we'll be breaking that glass ceiling, because we've never had a woman of color in the city of New York, but beyond that, the issue really comes down to a progressive agenda, issues that people care about. I mean, my, the district that I represent, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights, and Crown Heights, as you know, is ground zero for displacement. People, unfortunately, can no longer afford to live in downtown Brooklyn, and we need to change that. We need to focus not on luxury housing, which is, you know, being developed on every corner, but truly affordable housing and permanently affordable housing for low, moderate, and middle-income families in the city of New York, and largely units for children. So that's really what I want to focus on in this growing income inequality. A couple of weeks ago, I organized a rally for fast food workers, and most people think fast food workers are teenagers. They are not. The average fast food worker is a single mother who's older, over the age of 28 with a child. And so, you know, I have you guys challenge these stereotypes, which are obviously leading to the growing feminization of poverty. And the fastest growing industry in this city is retail, and it's this race to the bottom. They're paying people below, they're paying people minimum wage, and most of the wages cannot sustain their families. That's why we have this growing income inequality. So that's why I'm running for public advocate, because we need a voice. And I've been a fighter, a champion of the labor movement, which is why so many labor organizations have addressed my campaign. But this is no, you know, no easy race. You know, my opponent is engaging in smear tactics. He did a robocall today. You know, he's appealing to the worst of all of us. He's lying about my record, attacking me personally, because they're running desperate. Instead of focusing on the issue, he just wants to engage in this, you know, nasty campaign, you know, which turns people off, and why so many people are cynical about politics. And we're trying to stay above it, and we hope all of your listeners come out and vote, because this really is a David and Goliath fight. He's got some powerful people behind him. But I've got the power of the people behind me. So I need everyone to come out and vote tomorrow. Letitia, how do you turn some of these concerns that you have registered? You are a legal aid defense counsel, you went to Howard University, you are concerned as an African American woman, we live in a situation where a society where, well, in New York, there's a great deal of diversity, but even greater reality of separation of groups of people along racial and ethnic lines. How do you translate these into policies that begin to equalize things within the context of the public advocate's office? So, again, one of the things that we did as a member of the city council is the sick leave. But the sick leave bill apparently didn't go far enough. We need to expand it. Living wage didn't go far enough. We need to expand the living wage bill. We need to truly reform, stop the health risk. We need to ban racial profiling. We need police officers who truly respect individuals in the city of New York. We need to bring back community policing. We need to organize fast food workers in other sectors of the community, of certain industries, and demand and put into legislation that people pay a living wage. We need to, again, defend the Affordable Health Care Act. And tomorrow, before people go out to vote, those who are underinsured and underinsured get registered with these exchanges. We need to organize people. We need to focus on the educational system and make sure the voice of parents is heard. We need to make sure that the municipal workers get a fair contract in the city of New York. We need to identify waste and abuse in government, because there's a lot. As you know, I uncovered the biggest scandal in the city of New York, known as City Time. Mayor Bloomberg had outsourced municipal services, basically timekeeping system, to a private entity that ripped all of us off to the tune of $800 million. And I recovered $500 million after having three hearings, and their company is now dissolved, and the principals are in jail. But there were other contracts. There were at least seven other contracts that I wanted to investigate. And unfortunately, I was transferred to another committee. And there's a lot of privatization in government, and we really need to examine all of those contracts that Mayor Bloomberg put in place, because there are savings for a lot of municipal resources and for taxpayers in the city of New York. And we need to change our economic development policies to incorporate low-income people, people living below the poverty level. And we need to stop giving so many tax breaks to developers and the rich and the well-connected in the city of New York. Once we start examining all of the policies and all of the contracts that have been put in place by Mayor Bloomberg, it's I feel confident that we will achieve some savings for New Yorkers in the city of New York. Leticia, are we contracting out too much? And what kinds of safeguards should we be looking at in terms of those contracts that we do put out? I remember in the City Time contract, they basically had contract workers supervising other contract workers. Do we need to look more closely at those kinds of things also? Yes. All the contracts that I wanted to examine were similar to City Time. And they were paying consultants $400 an hour to do the same work that municipal workers were engaging in, who were being paid much less than that, significantly much less than that, and workers who did not have a contract. I had eight contracts that I wanted to examine, totaling billions of dollars. And because I wanted to basically expose those contracts similar to what I did on City Time, they pulled the rug from under me and they said, oh, she can no longer be chair of contracts. She did us enough harm. Let's transfer her. And I became chair of sanitation overnight. And I really want to go back and look at those contracts and others within the Department of Economic Development, within the Department of Education, within DOIT. And that's principally why I think they don't want me to be the next public advocate, which is why they're attempting to engage in this smear campaign against me. You know, Leticia, the tricks that they have engaged in in the last 36 hours is just, it reaches an all-time low. Leticia, one of the other things that I'm interested in, certainly we have heard less discussion of the Street Crimes Unit. We did manage to get through with your assistance, Jumaane Williams, et cetera, and against a mayoral veto, a public safety act that will begin to take place. Some of the worst and unconstitutional manifestations of racial profiling as part of stop and frisk. But how do you begin to deal with the safety of our communities and the massive use of gun plays in poor communities? And frankly, do you actually even see? Is the issue really the correlation between crime and poverty? How do you use the public advocate's position as a bully pulpit to deal with people who are being hurt by violence in our communities? There's a lot of wonderful organizations that are on the ground, and we need to fund those organizations. Like, for instance, in East New York, there's an organization called Man Up, led by this wonderful gentleman whose last name is, I think his name is Timothy Mitchell. Or Andre Mitchell. And, you know, within the last couple of months in East New York, some parts, we have seen a major reduction in crime, and primarily because he is someone who intervenes in crime, and he hires former individuals who are members of gangs to intervene and reduce the amount of violence. And similar organizations, they're called, you know, interveners. They're all throughout the city of New York, but they don't receive adequate funding. And on that type of community-based organizations where people are on the ground, they represent boots on the ground, and hire these individuals who can basically try to resolve differences before they get to a point where people resort to violence. That's what we need to do. We need more community policing. We also need police for housing. There was a time within public housing, everyone knew their officer. They consolidated the three levels of police units. That caused a major problem, because oftentimes you have police officers who are coming to public housing, and no one, they have no familiarity with any of the residents. They don't know who is engaging in drug activity, who is engaging in gang activity, or other. And there's that level of trust, which unfortunately is no longer there, because of the abuses related to stop and frisk. And so we really just need to get back to the basics. It's community policing. It's more community-based organizations. It's working with people, individuals who people respect. In my district in Fort Greene, the individual that people respect the most is a member of the, a minister, Reverend Taylor. And when he speaks, they listen. He talks to the gang leaders. He, you know, you know, goes out in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night, and tries to intervene. And, and talk to individuals. He tries to employ young people, and young men who have a difficult time finding employment. He demands from these developers that they hire locally. These types of measures and others are what we really need to be examining in the city of New York. We need to adopt some of the models that have been put in place, and some of the initiatives that have been put forth by the Black Puerto Rican Asian Caucus of the City Council and the state legislature, and fund these programs. You talked about, and you talked just recently on this program, about the plight of low-wage, minimum-wage workers in the city. But there's also, and you didn't talk about this this time, the low-wage, minimum-wage workers who don't get even their minimum wage, who are exploited, whose tips are stolen, who are forced to work overtime and not get paid. There's an epidemic of this, and the state government isn't really doing a good job on this. How would a public advocate work on this to at least enforce the minimum wage as paltry as it is? So one of the things that I would love to do as the next public advocate is hire some investigators and some attorneys to do social impact cases. And one of the areas that I would like to focus on is businesses that unfortunately engage in these deceptive business practices and actually engage in wage theft. That is a major problem in the city of New York. I've received a number of complaints in my office, and I know that it is a systematic problem all throughout the city of New York. And I think with a team of attorneys and with some investigators, we really can take some action on this and file some major lawsuits that would reform how we do business in the city of New York. And the mayor has said that he wants more billionaires and more billionaires to come to the city and believes that their tax dollars are the funding apparatus for the general city coffers. But of course, make short shrift of the increasing disparity of wealth in this society. And yes, this is the tale of two cities. How do you respond to that increasing disparity of income and the enormity of wealth concentration in the hands of a few? The mayor is just out of touch, and that's why we need to get past 12 years of Mayor Bloomberg. He's living in a gilded age, and we need to get past his flawed policies and the fact that he's really just catered to the rich and the well-connected. Do we need a millionaire's tax? It would be great to have a millionaire's tax, but I just think our economic development policies in the city of New York, we need a major reform of our economic development policies in the city of New York. We have catered to the rich and the well-connected for far too long, and it's time that we focus on the middle class and working people in the city of New York, who basically, as you know, are the engine of our economy in the city of New York as opposed to a few billionaires. One of the things, you know, the doors at the inn are closed. We are at record numbers for the homeless, and the doors in the inn, are closed. We haven't had public housing allocation of funds since the Nixon years when there was a freeze. So what are the kind of policies that we need to put into effect as a mechanism for building not affordable, but low-income housing, which is really where the need lies? So what we need to do is, you know, we had a program in the city of New York known as Advantage, and we just continued Advantage, and that resulted in a major increase in homelessness in the city of New York. We need to subsidize the individuals who, unfortunately, have been subsidized tenants who are having a difficult time affording to rent in New York City. That's what we really need. We need a voucher program in the city of New York, and we really need to focus on giving vouchers and subsidizing rent. But, you know, there aren't any vouchers at this point. I mean, there really aren't any rent subsidies, and most of that would be federal monies. Well, that's what my point is, is that we need to create a program, and to argue that there is no money in the city of New York, I think, is not true. Again, I examined one contract and recovered $500 million, and I had eight other contracts, and if we were to examine all of those contracts, I'm sure that there's a lot of waste and fraud. We can recover funds to subsidize tenants and to create another voucher program in the city of New York. There's so much private contracts in the Department of Education, and particularly where they do it in economic development, that we could find the resources to pay to subsidize tenants rent in the city of New York. We are paying hotel, we're still paying hotel operators millions of dollars to rent to homeless families in the city of New York.

"ori_dict": {"text": " Councilwoman Letitia James accepted that invitation. Regrettably, State Senator Daniel Squadron had a scheduling conflict. This is an important race, and we urge you to make plans to vote Tuesday, October 1st, in the runoff election for New York City public advocate. And to further inform your vote, we're joined now by Letitia James. And good evening. Good evening, and thank you for allowing me to speak to some of your listeners tonight. It's a very important election tomorrow. Well, indeed it is, and because it's so important, one of the things that I'm particularly interested in knowing and understanding is really, how does your career development, how does your, and it's really kind of a combination of circumstances here, because I'm concerned about time constraints, but the career development, you as a woman running in a key citywide political office where there are no other women in similar situations, and being an African American in a city that is now a majority population of people of color, how do these aspects of your life really inform your positions? And the role that you would like to see yourself play as public advocate? Well, Mimi, you know, I wasn't born with a golden spoon in my mouth. I was born in poverty. My mother scrubbed floors, my father was a janitor. And I can recall at an early age when my brother was arrested, falsely accused of a crime, my mother took me down to criminal court. And I always remember that everyone in the courtroom did not look like me other than the defendants. And I remember the court officers treating my mother with great disrespect, and they were very rude. And as a result of that, that sort of shaped and colored my views on the importance of education, one. And two, that I really wanted to serve and grow up and become an attorney and commit my life to social justice. And so that in the future, no other mother or grandmother or father or grandfather, when they came to court, just trying to find out where their child was, would ever be disrespected. So I just really wanted to change that picture. And as you know, I'm a graduate of Howard University, and they trained me not to just be an attorney, but to be a social engineer and commit my life to social justice. And so upon graduation, I worked for the Legal Aid Society. I was a criminal defense attorney. I was representing children and victims of domestic violence. I then went on to work in the state legislature as an attorney to Al Vann and Roger Green and a number of other progressive members of the legislature, focusing on issues affecting low-income communities and people of color. Then was a former assistant attorney general where we investigated stop and frisk within NYPD almost 15 years ago, and basically taking on businesses that engaged in deceptive business practices against vulnerable populations. And then the last 10 years, and as a member of the city council, you know, I've taken the Mayor Bloomberg on at every turn. From the extension of term limits, I challenged him with Bill de Blasio, went to court. Unsuccessful, but when the Democratic nominee, Bill Thompson at the time, was on the ballot, I worked like hell to try to get him elected, unlike my opponent who did not endorse him and did nothing for him. In fact, claims he was too busy. I challenged the administration on closing the child care slots, on overriding his veto of the abuses related to stop and frisk and banning racial profiling in the city of New York, his policies on the homeless, and his policies, you know, in the city of New York. You know, we've got income inequality, we've got the feminization of poverty. 52,000 individuals are living in our shelters this evening, a third of them are children. We just need to move past this administration, and we need a more progressive agenda, and that's why I'm running for public and I know I have challenges. Yes, I am a woman and a woman of color, and yes, we'll be breaking that glass ceiling, because we've never had a woman of color in the city of New York, but beyond that, the issue really comes down to a progressive agenda, issues that people care about. I mean, my, the district that I represent, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights, and Crown Heights, as you know, is ground zero for displacement. People, unfortunately, can no longer afford to live in downtown Brooklyn, and we need to change that. We need to focus not on luxury housing, which is, you know, being developed on every corner, but truly affordable housing and permanently affordable housing for low, moderate, and middle-income families in the city of New York, and largely units for children. So that's really what I want to focus on in this growing income inequality. A couple of weeks ago, I organized a rally for fast food workers, and most people think fast food workers are teenagers. They are not. The average fast food worker is a single mother who's older, over the age of 28 with a child. And so, you know, I have you guys challenge these stereotypes, which are obviously leading to the growing feminization of poverty. And the fastest growing industry in this city is retail, and it's this race to the bottom. They're paying people below, they're paying people minimum wage, and most of the wages cannot sustain their families. That's why we have this growing income inequality. So that's why I'm running for public advocate, because we need a voice. And I've been a fighter, a champion of the labor movement, which is why so many labor organizations have addressed my campaign. But this is no, you know, no easy race. You know, my opponent is engaging in smear tactics. He did a robocall today. You know, he's appealing to the worst of all of us. He's lying about my record, attacking me personally, because they're running desperate. Instead of focusing on the issue, he just wants to engage in this, you know, nasty campaign, you know, which turns people off, and why so many people are cynical about politics. And we're trying to stay above it, and we hope all of your listeners come out and vote, because this really is a David and Goliath fight. He's got some powerful people behind him. But I've got the power of the people behind me. So I need everyone to come out and vote tomorrow. Letitia, how do you turn some of these concerns that you have registered? You are a legal aid defense counsel, you went to Howard University, you are concerned as an African American woman, we live in a situation where a society where, well, in New York, there's a great deal of diversity, but even greater reality of separation of groups of people along racial and ethnic lines. How do you translate these into policies that begin to equalize things within the context of the public advocate's office? So, again, one of the things that we did as a member of the city council is the sick leave. But the sick leave bill apparently didn't go far enough. We need to expand it. Living wage didn't go far enough. We need to expand the living wage bill. We need to truly reform, stop the health risk. We need to ban racial profiling. We need police officers who truly respect individuals in the city of New York. We need to bring back community policing. We need to organize fast food workers in other sectors of the community, of certain industries, and demand and put into legislation that people pay a living wage. We need to, again, defend the Affordable Health Care Act. And tomorrow, before people go out to vote, those who are underinsured and underinsured get registered with these exchanges. We need to organize people. We need to focus on the educational system and make sure the voice of parents is heard. We need to make sure that the municipal workers get a fair contract in the city of New York. We need to identify waste and abuse in government, because there's a lot. As you know, I uncovered the biggest scandal in the city of New York, known as City Time. Mayor Bloomberg had outsourced municipal services, basically timekeeping system, to a private entity that ripped all of us off to the tune of $800 million. And I recovered $500 million after having three hearings, and their company is now dissolved, and the principals are in jail. But there were other contracts. There were at least seven other contracts that I wanted to investigate. And unfortunately, I was transferred to another committee. And there's a lot of privatization in government, and we really need to examine all of those contracts that Mayor Bloomberg put in place, because there are savings for a lot of municipal resources and for taxpayers in the city of New York. And we need to change our economic development policies to incorporate low-income people, people living below the poverty level. And we need to stop giving so many tax breaks to developers and the rich and the well-connected in the city of New York. Once we start examining all of the policies and all of the contracts that have been put in place by Mayor Bloomberg, it's I feel confident that we will achieve some savings for New Yorkers in the city of New York. Leticia, are we contracting out too much? And what kinds of safeguards should we be looking at in terms of those contracts that we do put out? I remember in the City Time contract, they basically had contract workers supervising other contract workers. Do we need to look more closely at those kinds of things also? Yes. All the contracts that I wanted to examine were similar to City Time. And they were paying consultants $400 an hour to do the same work that municipal workers were engaging in, who were being paid much less than that, significantly much less than that, and workers who did not have a contract. I had eight contracts that I wanted to examine, totaling billions of dollars. And because I wanted to basically expose those contracts similar to what I did on City Time, they pulled the rug from under me and they said, oh, she can no longer be chair of contracts. She did us enough harm. Let's transfer her. And I became chair of sanitation overnight. And I really want to go back and look at those contracts and others within the Department of Economic Development, within the Department of Education, within DOIT. And that's principally why I think they don't want me to be the next public advocate, which is why they're attempting to engage in this smear campaign against me. You know, Leticia, the tricks that they have engaged in in the last 36 hours is just, it reaches an all-time low. Leticia, one of the other things that I'm interested in, certainly we have heard less discussion of the Street Crimes Unit. We did manage to get through with your assistance, Jumaane Williams, et cetera, and against a mayoral veto, a public safety act that will begin to take place. Some of the worst and unconstitutional manifestations of racial profiling as part of stop and frisk. But how do you begin to deal with the safety of our communities and the massive use of gun plays in poor communities? And frankly, do you actually even see? Is the issue really the correlation between crime and poverty? How do you use the public advocate's position as a bully pulpit to deal with people who are being hurt by violence in our communities? There's a lot of wonderful organizations that are on the ground, and we need to fund those organizations. Like, for instance, in East New York, there's an organization called Man Up, led by this wonderful gentleman whose last name is, I think his name is Timothy Mitchell. Or Andre Mitchell. And, you know, within the last couple of months in East New York, some parts, we have seen a major reduction in crime, and primarily because he is someone who intervenes in crime, and he hires former individuals who are members of gangs to intervene and reduce the amount of violence. And similar organizations, they're called, you know, interveners. They're all throughout the city of New York, but they don't receive adequate funding. And on that type of community-based organizations where people are on the ground, they represent boots on the ground, and hire these individuals who can basically try to resolve differences before they get to a point where people resort to violence. That's what we need to do. We need more community policing. We also need police for housing. There was a time within public housing, everyone knew their officer. They consolidated the three levels of police units. That caused a major problem, because oftentimes you have police officers who are coming to public housing, and no one, they have no familiarity with any of the residents. They don't know who is engaging in drug activity, who is engaging in gang activity, or other. And there's that level of trust, which unfortunately is no longer there, because of the abuses related to stop and frisk. And so we really just need to get back to the basics. It's community policing. It's more community-based organizations. It's working with people, individuals who people respect. In my district in Fort Greene, the individual that people respect the most is a member of the, a minister, Reverend Taylor. And when he speaks, they listen. He talks to the gang leaders. He, you know, you know, goes out in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night, and tries to intervene. And, and talk to individuals. He tries to employ young people, and young men who have a difficult time finding employment. He demands from these developers that they hire locally. These types of measures and others are what we really need to be examining in the city of New York. We need to adopt some of the models that have been put in place, and some of the initiatives that have been put forth by the Black Puerto Rican Asian Caucus of the City Council and the state legislature, and fund these programs. You talked about, and you talked just recently on this program, about the plight of low-wage, minimum-wage workers in the city. But there's also, and you didn't talk about this this time, the low-wage, minimum-wage workers who don't get even their minimum wage, who are exploited, whose tips are stolen, who are forced to work overtime and not get paid. There's an epidemic of this, and the state government isn't really doing a good job on this. How would a public advocate work on this to at least enforce the minimum wage as paltry as it is? So one of the things that I would love to do as the next public advocate is hire some investigators and some attorneys to do social impact cases. And one of the areas that I would like to focus on is businesses that unfortunately engage in these deceptive business practices and actually engage in wage theft. That is a major problem in the city of New York. I've received a number of complaints in my office, and I know that it is a systematic problem all throughout the city of New York. And I think with a team of attorneys and with some investigators, we really can take some action on this and file some major lawsuits that would reform how we do business in the city of New York. And the mayor has said that he wants more billionaires and more billionaires to come to the city and believes that their tax dollars are the funding apparatus for the general city coffers. But of course, make short shrift of the increasing disparity of wealth in this society. And yes, this is the tale of two cities. How do you respond to that increasing disparity of income and the enormity of wealth concentration in the hands of a few? The mayor is just out of touch, and that's why we need to get past 12 years of Mayor Bloomberg. He's living in a gilded age, and we need to get past his flawed policies and the fact that he's really just catered to the rich and the well-connected. Do we need a millionaire's tax? It would be great to have a millionaire's tax, but I just think our economic development policies in the city of New York, we need a major reform of our economic development policies in the city of New York. We have catered to the rich and the well-connected for far too long, and it's time that we focus on the middle class and working people in the city of New York, who basically, as you know, are the engine of our economy in the city of New York as opposed to a few billionaires. One of the things, you know, the doors at the inn are closed. We are at record numbers for the homeless, and the doors in the inn, are closed. We haven't had public housing allocation of funds since the Nixon years when there was a freeze. So what are the kind of policies that we need to put into effect as a mechanism for building not affordable, but low-income housing, which is really where the need lies? So what we need to do is, you know, we had a program in the city of New York known as Advantage, and we just continued Advantage, and that resulted in a major increase in homelessness in the city of New York. We need to subsidize the individuals who, unfortunately, have been subsidized tenants who are having a difficult time affording to rent in New York City. That's what we really need. We need a voucher program in the city of New York, and we really need to focus on giving vouchers and subsidizing rent. But, you know, there aren't any vouchers at this point. I mean, there really aren't any rent subsidies, and most of that would be federal monies. Well, that's what my point is, is that we need to create a program, and to argue that there is no money in the city of New York, I think, is not true. Again, I examined one contract and recovered $500 million, and I had eight other contracts, and if we were to examine all of those contracts, I'm sure that there's a lot of waste and fraud. We can recover funds to subsidize tenants and to create another voucher program in the city of New York. There's so much private contracts in the Department of Education, and particularly where they do it in economic development, that we could find the resources to pay to subsidize tenants rent in the city of New York. We are paying hotel, we're still paying hotel operators millions of dollars to rent to homeless families in the city of New York. It's just really unacceptable.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.12, "end": 3.7, "text": " Councilwoman Letitia James accepted that invitation.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [7076, 18339, 961, 270, 654,
