{"text": " People Rise Up Radio presents some information for activists on how to spot infiltrators and keep yourself safe. How to spot a spy. One way to neutralize potential activists is to get them into a group that does all the wrong things. Why? One, so the message doesn't get out. Two, so time is wasted. Three, to frustrate and discourage activists. And four, so simply nothing good or effective can be accomplished. FBI and police informers and infiltrators will infest any group, but they have also been known to establish phony activist organizations themselves. Their primary purpose is to prevent an effective movement for social, environmental, and economic justice from developing. Agents come in small, medium, or large, and be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It's the idea behind the movement and its potential for increasing in size and impact which attracts spies and saboteurs. These are some of the tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy a movement, and keep tabs on activists. One tactic is to destroy a group outright. Another is to manipulate from within. For example, an agent may tell an activist, you're dividing the movement. Because this invites guilty feelings, guilt is an especially potent control mechanism when relations have been established through dedication to a cause. When an agent criticizes an activist in such a manner, they are not only questioning their dedication to the cause, but making the activist feel responsible for any issues that threaten the cause. An agent might tell an activist, you're a leader. This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem and creates a sense of shared perspective. Agents often benefit from empowering any feelings of righteousness an activist may develop from making altruistic contributions. Malignant pseudo-identification is the process where an agent consciously imitates certain behaviors or mannerisms to nurture the activist's identification with the agent, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. If an agent successfully creates this sense of kinship with an activist, the activist may be more likely to commit an illegal act in service to their newfound friend. Agents may also employ tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt to induce empathy with the aim of manipulating the good-natured activist. It may be difficult to differentiate such constructed dramas from the real thing. However, it is possible for activists to identify a fraud by employing two simple tactics. First, remain cool and detached. Second, observe. In the face of such a cool response, an agent will often quickly readjust. This will appear to be an abrupt about-face in the context to the emotional drama the agent has just played out. Knowing the activist cannot be emotionally hooked, the agent will usually move on to other activists in short order. Follow the leader is another tactic an agent may employ. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner in discussions, both online and in person. An agent employs these techniques in order to disrupt the agenda or sidetrack the discussion. And an agent will often interrupt a discussion repeatedly or feign ignorance, causing others to constantly repeat themselves or waste time explaining a very simple concept that most others will quickly understand. An agent may also make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of other group members, and in turn derails the discussion while invalidating whatever point was being made. Saboteurs. Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will write encyclopedic flyers or website pages to deter potential activists from participating by making the issue too complex and boring to ignite taking action. He or she might print flyers in English only, disenfranchising communities whose first language is not English. The agent might suggest demonstrations be held in places where no one cares about the issue or cause, or where it will not be seen by many people. An agent might also try to confuse issues, blurring the lines between issues and broadening the scope beyond reason. Making the wrong demands, as in making demands that are unrelated or far-reaching, that are unprincipled according to the group, demands that are ineffectual or serving no strategic purpose. Making too many demands in order to obscure the focus on the issue and suggesting impossible or improbable demands which may make the effort appear unreasonable. Have endless discussions that waste everybody's time by turning the topic at hand into philosophical diatribes or adding lengthy personal stories. Agents will also make complaints of needing social time together or taking things too seriously while complex issues or plans are being discussed. Provocateurs might try to establish leaders to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. Or they might suggest doing foolish and illegal things that will get the activists in trouble and make the movement look bad in the eyes of the public. They will often taunt the authorities above and beyond the context of the scene on the ground and will encourage others to follow suit. Or they might attempt to make activists compromise their values, which they may use against an activist at a later date, to discredit or invalidate anything of value the activist might contribute. Instigating violence. Provocateurs will attempt to escalate a situation by agitating to the point of physical confrontation with other activists or bystanders. Some will stage an act of vandalism from within a crowd as a means to trigger violent responses from others or the police. Which is particularly effective when amongst people who are ill-prepared to deal with such violence. Causing violence to occur not only serves to smear the movement in the press, but can also deter future participation by current members and the public at large. Causing this type of chaos, fear, and confusion can also aid agents in concealing their identity when fleeing the scene after their goal is accomplished. Informants. Informants want everyone to sign up. Sign in and sign everything. Record keeping, evidence, and contact info for tracing and tracking. Informants ask a lot of questions for data gathering on individuals. Police compile this information and keep it on hand at protests to identify activists and make targeted arrests. Informants want to know which events activists are planning to attend to further the shared perspective facade, continue surveillance efforts, and expand databases. Informants attempt to make the activist defensive in order to identify beliefs, goals, and level of commitment. Playing the contrarian or questioning as if they don't understand or playing stupid, but arguing with the activist nonetheless. Recruiting. Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialogue. Their actions, belief, and goals speak for themselves. Do recruit. Are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents? Surveillance. Always assume that you are under surveillance, on the ground and online, and that there are infiltrators, agents, amongst and within your group. If you're not under surveillance and being infiltrated, then agents aren't doing their job and you aren't a very effective activist or group. Scare tactics. They use them. Tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to a disaffected or minimally committed fellow activist to persuade them to turn against the movement, and give false testimony against their former comrades. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest. They will plant false information and set up, quote, exposure. They will send incriminating communications in the name of an activist. Putting activists in a sticky legal situation, can lead to cooperation with the police state, and this tactic is especially effective when an activist has developed a sense of disconnection, typically heightened by a bond with an agent. If an agent is exposed, he or she will be transferred or replaced. Communications between trusted activist groups across the country can be very useful for this reason. I added that. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different codename. Although, it's no longer placed on paper, where it can be discovered through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose is to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorizes as being opposed to, quote, national

yourself safe. How to spot a spy. One way to neutralize potential activists is to get them into a group that does all the wrong things. Why? One, so the message doesn't get out. Two, so time is wasted. Three, to frustrate and discourage activists. And four, so simply nothing good or effective can be accomplished. FBI and police informers and infiltrators will infest any group, but they have also been known to establish phony activist organizations themselves. Their primary purpose is to prevent an effective movement for social, environmental, and economic justice from developing. Agents come in small, medium, or large, and be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It's the idea behind the movement and its potential for increasing in size and impact which attracts spies and saboteurs. These are some of the tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy a movement, and keep tabs on activists. One tactic is to destroy a group outright. Another is to manipulate from within. For example, an agent may tell an activist, you're dividing the movement. Because this invites guilty feelings, guilt is an especially potent control mechanism when relations have been established through dedication to a cause. When an agent criticizes an activist in such a manner, they are not only questioning their dedication to the cause, but making the activist feel responsible for any issues that threaten the cause. An agent might tell an activist, you're a leader. This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem and creates a sense of shared perspective. Agents often benefit from empowering any feelings of righteousness an activist may develop from making altruistic contributions. Malignant pseudo-identification is the process where an agent consciously imitates certain behaviors or mannerisms to nurture the activist's identification with the agent, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. If an agent successfully creates this sense of kinship with an activist, the activist may be more likely to commit an illegal act in service to their newfound friend. Agents may also employ tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt to induce empathy with the aim of manipulating the good-natured activist. It may be difficult to differentiate such constructed dramas from the real thing. However, it is possible for activists to identify a fraud by employing two simple tactics. First, remain cool and detached. Second, observe. In the face of such a cool response, an agent will often quickly readjust. This will appear to be an abrupt about-face in the context to the emotional drama the agent has just played out. Knowing the activist cannot be emotionally hooked, the agent will usually move on to other activists in short order. Follow the leader is another tactic an agent may employ. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner in discussions, both online and in person. An agent employs these techniques in order to disrupt the agenda or sidetrack the discussion. And an agent will often interrupt a discussion repeatedly or feign ignorance, causing others to constantly repeat themselves or waste time explaining a very simple concept that most others will quickly understand. An agent may also make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of other group members, and in turn derails the discussion while invalidating whatever point was being made. Saboteurs. Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will write encyclopedic flyers or website pages to deter potential activists from participating by making the issue too complex and boring to ignite taking action. He or she might print flyers in English only, disenfranchising communities whose first language is not English. The agent might suggest demonstrations be held in places where no one cares about the issue or cause, or where it will not be seen by many people. An agent might also try to confuse issues, blurring the lines between issues and broadening the scope beyond reason. Making the wrong demands, as in making demands that are unrelated or far-reaching, that are unprincipled according to the group, demands that are ineffectual or serving no strategic purpose. Making too many demands in order to obscure the focus on the issue and suggesting impossible or improbable demands which may make the effort appear unreasonable. Have endless discussions that waste everybody's time by turning the topic at hand into philosophical diatribes or adding lengthy personal stories. Agents will also make complaints of needing social time together or taking things too seriously while complex issues or plans are being discussed. Provocateurs might try to establish leaders to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. Or they might suggest doing foolish and illegal things that will get the activists in trouble and make the movement look bad in the eyes of the public. They will often taunt the authorities above and beyond the context of the scene on the ground and will encourage others to follow suit. Or they might attempt to make activists compromise their values, which they may use against an activist at a later date, to discredit or invalidate anything of value the activist might contribute. Instigating violence. Provocateurs will attempt to escalate a situation by agitating to the point of physical confrontation with other activists or bystanders. Some will stage an act of vandalism from within a crowd as a means to trigger violent responses from others or the police. Which is particularly effective when amongst people who are ill-prepared to deal with such violence. Causing violence to occur not only serves to smear the movement in the press, but can also deter future participation by current members and the public at large. Causing this type of chaos, fear, and confusion can also aid agents in concealing their identity when fleeing the scene after their goal is accomplished. Informants. Informants want everyone to sign up. Sign in and sign everything. Record keeping, evidence, and contact info for tracing and tracking. Informants ask a lot of questions for data gathering on individuals. Police compile this information and keep it on hand at protests to identify activists and make targeted arrests. Informants want to know which events activists are planning to attend to further the shared perspective facade, continue surveillance efforts, and expand databases. Informants attempt to make the activist defensive in order to identify beliefs, goals, and level of commitment. Playing the contrarian or questioning as if they don't understand or playing stupid, but arguing with the activist nonetheless. Recruiting. Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialogue. Their actions, belief, and goals speak for themselves. Do recruit. Are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents? Surveillance. Always assume that you are under surveillance, on the ground and online, and that there are infiltrators, agents, amongst and within your group. If you're not under surveillance and being infiltrated, then agents aren't doing their job and you aren't a very effective activist or group. Scare tactics. They use them. Tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to a disaffected or minimally committed fellow activist to persuade them to turn against the movement, and give false testimony against their former comrades. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest. They will plant false information and set up, quote, exposure. They will send incriminating communications in the name of an activist. Putting activists in a sticky legal situation, can lead to cooperation with the police state, and this tactic is especially effective when an activist has developed a sense of disconnection, typically heightened by a bond with an agent. If an agent is exposed, he or she will be transferred or replaced. Communications between trusted activist groups across the country can be very useful for this reason. I added that.
