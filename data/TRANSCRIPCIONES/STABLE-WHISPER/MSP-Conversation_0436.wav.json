{"text": " One of the things, as the years passed, since I returned in 1970, I think one of the interesting things is that I'm okay with the defeat that America went through in Vietnam because I know it was the politicians who lost the war, not the military. And I think that's one of the things that frustrates me more today is the fact that it's like they don't want, our elected officials don't want us to win for a variety of reasons, and that's another show in itself. But the one good thing I'm proud of is the American society is absolutely reaching out to veterans. You have the Wounded Warrior Projects, you have TAPS, and I'll touch on that in a minute, but I see people going up to veterans who are wearing their decorations or a hat and they're thanking them for their service. My five-year-old granddaughter and I, our family, were at a granddaughter high school graduation on Thursday, and there was a Marine there. My five-year-old got so excited and reached out to him and said, thank you for your service. And, you know, those are the type of things that give me faith in the future. But, you know, when you think about that, you see, you turn on the news and you see the ISIS in the Middle East and the headlines are, you know, we don't have a plan to address it. And it seems that our president and our Congress, you know, they're willing to send these young men and women who aren't volunteers. They'll send them in harm's way and they don't have a plan to win. They just, they don't, there's not, I don't see, you know, in World War II, like the gentleman was saying, you didn't come home until it's over. And they knew what they had to do. They knew who the evil was and they knew, and yet they became the best equipped fighting force in the history of the world. But today, I am absolutely, afraid of the futures of my children and my grandchildren. And I'm doing everything in my power to make sure they understand that sacrifices are going to have to be made. And if they're not already in America, they're on their way. And our life, when I saw the towers fell, the first thing that went through my head was, it's the impact this is going to have on my grandkids that's going to be so important. Now, about my experience in Vietnam, I came from central Illinois, went to a school, 500 in our senior class. There were, it was, we had black students and white students, but I didn't have any black friends that I could call friends. And when I got there to Vietnam and I got to my outfit, I met a guy named Cleveland Ford. And I, it turned out that he was my first black friend and he was killed. And I met him. And I met with his folks who lived in Chicago years later. And I found out through pictures and super eight movies and letters he had sent home that I was his first white friend. And those are the type of things that I found in any type of a war zone. If you are in harm's way and you need help, you don't care if that hand that comes out as a white hand, a black hand, brown hand, whatever it is. And that's, that's the brotherhood. And that's the real thing. The real thing that pulls veterans together is the fact that if I need help, I know somebody's going to be there to help me. We've seen accidents on the highway and, and people just drive by them. I mean, but it's different, obviously. When I came home from Vietnam, my younger brother, Steve, he went to, he went to Vietnam in 1969 and he was a door gunner on a Huey helicopter that crashed and burned. And I was actually in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And I found out through my TAC officer that he had died. And when I, I, I took my, I had a new son. I took my wife and we drove back to Decatur, Illinois. And the casualty officer did not know that I was still active duty military. And so he came over and he said, would you like to be the body escort for your brother? And my mother came over and put her arm around me and said, yes, he does. And there's an absolute, the best movie I have seen in many, many years called Taking Chance. It's a, it's a HBO documentary or a movie, HBO movie about a true story about a Marine officer who volunteers to escort a body home. And that's exactly what I did. I went out to San Francisco. I went through a day's training. I accepted the body. I got the airport, brought him back home, took him to the, took him to the funeral home. And we decided to have a, the funeral director and I decided it would be best to have a closed casket. And it was one of those things that my mother, to the day she died, she wasn't sure that her son was in there. But, you know, as I came back, I was treated with such honor, such, such respect. But the absolute hardest thing I ever did in my life is because I was the body escort, I was representing the president and America and the honor guard folded the flag. I saluted it. They handed it to me. They saluted it. And then I had to hand it to my mother. And that just was something that I had to do. And I did. I met yesterday with a Vietnam veteran. I met at the Wings over the Rockies Museum. We had a veteran's breakfast earlier this year. And, and we became, instant friends. And we went out to lunch this week and he had signed a confidential agreement. He, there was stuff he couldn't talk about for 40 years. No, time had expired. And I sit and listen to a man pour out his heart for three and a half hours. And it was my day to listen. There are stories that veterans have. You can't, they'll tell you if, if they want to. And this gentleman wanted to. And now I know I have a lifetime friend. Part of what I said earlier was TAPS. TAPS is not Wounded Warriors. They're still alive. TAPS is the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. And it's for the families of our soldiers killed. Even those, and I heard this on your show earlier in a commercial, even those that commit suicide, we take care of their families, their kids, their spouses. It's an absolute wonderful charity. It's been 10 years in Colorado. We've raised several million dollars. It's the highest national rating of any charity where the, the amount of funds that end up assisting the benefits, the benefits, the family for the soldier killed is number one in the nation. That's great. We have an event tomorrow at 4 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. at the Stampede on Havana in Aurora. And we've got several bars, or I'm sorry, we have several bands coming in. They're all Colorado bands, Denver bands, Wildfire, Richie Law. I can't remember all of them, but it's one of those things where it costs $25 to come in per person, $40 for a couple. We'll have a cash bar, hot dogs and hamburgers are also going to be there. But we raise money. And also we're having our annual TAPS thing that's going to be on Friday, June 26th. You can go to taps.org slash events and do that. And the last thing I'd like to share with you is that my wife and I and Bo and Lynn Cuttrell, we are stewards of a memorial. It's like the Vietnam wall and it's mobile, but it's pictures and it's pictures of native Coloradoans killed since 9-11. And there's 103 of them, 102 are men and one is a young lady. It's currently on display at Coors Visitor Center. And then next week we're going to take and put it up into, Jake Jabs is gracious enough, we put it in his corporate office there on 470. By the escalator, it is in color. It has their military pictures and family pictures. It is absolutely amazing. We had a young lady raise enough funds for us recently at a birthday party of all places that is going to allow us to take it to schools all over Colorado. Any event that people would like to have it set up and shown, you can go to www.rememberingourfallen.org and you click on Colorado and you can see it's, I put this thing up, and I take it down. I've done that many times. I know these guys. I know their faces. I talk to them and I kind of think they're listening to me. And they got excited when I took them down and told them I'm going to take you to Coors and set you up in a brewery. So that was a wonderful thing. But I would like to leave you with one thought, if you would. If you ask somebody, do you support our troops? If they say yes, if they just say yes, ask them, how do you support our troops? Do you visit the VA? Do you participate in veterans charity events? Do you at least have a bumper sticker? Do you say the Pledge of Allegiance? Do you reach out your hand and think a veteran? Because if you just say, yes, I support our military, it has a cold ring to it in my heart. I'd like to see people understand the cost of freedom. Well, Nolan, we really appreciate your time this afternoon. We appreciate your service. TAPS is a wonderful organization. So the information there is taps.org slash events. And Vietnam veterans, isn't there something that we're going around and it's just saying thank you. And it's a long overdue thank you. But thank you. We greatly appreciate the sacrifice. We appreciate what you've done. You know, Molly and I think every day that we stand on the shoulders of giants. And so we're trying to at least help out and do our part by getting your information out here because our young people need to hear Don. They need to hear Jim. They need to hear you. So thank you so much. I'm just absolutely honored. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Nolan. And thank you for the time that you're spending with the children right now. I know he's spending a lot of time talking to the kids about what's going on. And that's great because a lot don't seem to know that, like you said, they didn't know what a draft was. They're not familiar with it. Different things that happened historically because some people are changing history books. So I'm glad for people like Nolan that are talking to our children about the military and about the sacrifice that is required to secure the blessings of liberty for our future. We'll be right back. Welcome back to Heart of the Matter. I'm Kim Munson here with my good friend Molly Vogt. And we are doing a tribute to our combat veterans in honor of Memorial Day. We're honored to have Don Whipple in studio with us. We talked with Jim Doyle earlier, Nolan Hargrave. But I did want to first of all give a shout out to Predovich and Company. They're good friends of ours, Molly. And they're a full service certified public accounting firm. They provided tax, accounting, and other services to the Denver community since 1989. Dan Predovich is a second generation native Coloraduan and founder of this family operated firm. And the team of Predovich and Company are experienced in working with individuals, businesses, nonprofits, public companies, trusts, and estates. They do everything, Molly. So visit their website at dpredovich.com. That's D-P-R-E-D-O-V-I-C-H.com. Or call for a no charge, no obligation appointment at 303-791-3000. Awesome. So is somebody on the line, Molly? Oh, wait, wait. I had one thing I was supposed to share. That's right. Hey, Kathy, thank you for the great text. This is what Kathy says. Awesome show. Inspiring, informative, and touching. What a wonderful country we live in. So proud of our veterans. Gratitude to them all. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Thanks to Kathy for sharing that. Ellie Reynolds, are you here with us today? Yes. Thanks so much for joining us. You are the president of the Denver Metro Young Republicans, correct? Yeah. And thanks for having me on. And thank you for your service, Dawn. Awesome. Well, tell us what's going on. Yeah. So we're Denver Metro Young Republicans is putting together a tribute and a benefit, going to be kind of a presentation and an event at View House downtown on Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day. It's going to be the View House right next to Coors Field. We're going to have games, prizes, and 100% of the benefits is going to go to Wounded Warriors Impacting Neighbors. Great. Awesome. That's awesome. I see your Facebook page here, so everybody can check that out. And I just posted it on the AmeriChicks Facebook page, so you can see that. So that will be just great. Tuesday, 6 o'clock, View House, downtown Denver, and $10 at the door. The proceeds benefit Wounded Warriors. Yes. And we're going to have a beer pong tournament that's buy-in, and all that money is going back to Wounded Warriors as well. We're going to have multiple different uniforms on display. And Wounded Warriors, Impacting Neighbors, is actually an organization that's post-9-11, and it's going towards post-9-11 veterans, which is really near and dear to our generation's heart. So we're kind of really trying to tie that in and make it a fun event where we can bring quite a bit of people in, get good exposure for the Young Republicans group, and at the same time, all the benefits are going towards good cause. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Ellie. We appreciate it. We'll see you Tuesday night. Yeah. Good to talk to you, Ellie. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. You know, as we wrap it up, this has been a wonderful show, talking about our military. I've got to give a shout-out to some family members, because I wanted to let you know that the Vogt family has actually covered air, land, and sea for our country as well, and I'm very proud of that. My grandfather served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. He was a CB, and he was a combat construction worker, and he was literally right behind the Marines building infrastructures for the fighting force. And he was wounded twice. The second, a sniper's bullet caused an operation. He was in a oxygen tank he was using to weld something to explode. It broke his leg, but he lived, thank goodness. But, you know, he used a cane to get around a little while. Also, my Uncle Tom fought, he flew in the U.S. Air Force as a fighter pilot. He flew the F-4 Phantom, and his first tour in Southeast Asia was at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, second tour at Udon in Northern Thailand. So I wanted to give a shout-out to them as well. He flew in the U.S. Air Force as a SAC bomber pilot, and he hauled around atomic weapons, which is, of course, fabulous and very needed. Flew all around North Africa and Europe during the North Korean War. He was not in it. He was flying during that and scaring the Russians. So after that, he joined the Air National Guard and flew fighter pilots out of Seward at Nashville and went to Vanderbilt Law School after that and then became an entrepreneur. So my family has a lot of wonderful patriots. I just wanted to share that with you all and say thank you so much, and it's near and dear to my heart to everybody that risks so much for our great country. And I'd like to say thank you. My dad was Air Force, and my two uncles were served in the European theater. And one of my uncles served, did a number of bombing missions over the Balkans, and I think he did about 42 missions and was back farming by the time he was 21 years old. Leonard, to sit here with Don Whipple, Jim Doyle, what a great generation they are. Yes. I forgot to add my uncle Jim. I'm so sorry, because he was in the Army. Okay. And he was supposed to send me his information, and he did not, but he was in the Army, and he spent a lot of time in Germany. So there, Uncle Jim, thanks to you as well. Good for you. Right. So as we sign off, is it okay if we go back and ask Don just to talk to us real quick about a couple quotes that he wanted to share? Absolutely. He was the commander of the Pacific Fleet during World War II, and he was on the beaches there, or a deck of a ship or somewhere, and he was talking to a correspondent, and he said, all the men who were on Iwo Jima, it could be said about them, common valor was a common virtue. And I think I've never been around so much courageous, many courageous people in my life. The corpsmen and the coxswains and the boats and landing, they are just out of this world. Corpsmen are all of our heroes in the Marine Corps. But talking about heroes, I think the real heroes of any war are mothers and wives of, excuse me, guys who are out in the fields. Right. They're the real heroes. They have no way of seeing or doing anything about what's happening and I know my mother prayed me through World War II. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Don Whipple, this has just been a really special show, and I would encourage every one of us to get down on our knees this Memorial Day and pray for our soldiers and say thank you for the sacrifices that were made for us so that we can pass on the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. And there are bad guys out there, and our positive quote of the week, or maybe it's just a real one, but a real quote of the week, George Washington, this is what he said. He said, Amen, George Washington. Thank you again to all the amazing soldiers who put it on the line to secure the blessings of liberty. We stand on the soldiers of giants as Kim said earlier. Thank you to Don Whipple, Jim Doyle, Nolan Hargrave, and to the thousands of the rest of you who have sacrificed, are sacrificing, and will sacrifice for us. Your service is appreciated. Thank you. This is the AmeriChick signing off.

in 1970, I think one of the interesting things is that I'm okay with the defeat that America went through in Vietnam because I know it was the politicians who lost the war, not the military. And I think that's one of the things that frustrates me more today is the fact that it's like they don't want, our elected officials don't want us to win for a variety of reasons, and that's another show in itself. But the one good thing I'm proud of is the American society is absolutely reaching out to veterans. You have the Wounded Warrior Projects, you have TAPS, and I'll touch on that in a minute, but I see people going up to veterans who are wearing their decorations or a hat and they're thanking them for their service. My five-year-old granddaughter and I, our family, were at a granddaughter high school graduation on Thursday, and there was a Marine there. My five-year-old got so excited and reached out to him and said, thank you for your service. And, you know, those are the type of things that give me faith in the future. But, you know, when you think about that, you see, you turn on the news and you see the ISIS in the Middle East and the headlines are, you know, we don't have a plan to address it. And it seems that our president and our Congress, you know, they're willing to send these young men and women who aren't volunteers. They'll send them in harm's way and they don't have a plan to win. They just, they don't, there's not, I don't see, you know, in World War II, like the gentleman was saying, you didn't come home until it's over. And they knew what they had to do. They knew who the evil was and they knew, and yet they became the best equipped fighting force in the history of the world. But today, I am absolutely, afraid of the futures of my children and my grandchildren. And I'm doing everything in my power to make sure they understand that sacrifices are going to have to be made. And if they're not already in America, they're on their way. And our life, when I saw the towers fell, the first thing that went through my head was, it's the impact this is going to have on my grandkids that's going to be so important. Now, about my experience in Vietnam, I came from central Illinois, went to a school, 500 in our senior class. There were, it was, we had black students and white students, but I didn't have any black friends that I could call friends. And when I got there to Vietnam and I got to my outfit, I met a guy named Cleveland Ford. And I, it turned out that he was my first black friend and he was killed. And I met him. And I met with his folks who lived in Chicago years later. And I found out through pictures and super eight movies and letters he had sent home that I was his first white friend. And those are the type of things that I found in any type of a war zone. If you are in harm's way and you need help, you don't care if that hand that comes out as a white hand, a black hand, brown hand, whatever it is. And that's, that's the brotherhood. And that's the real thing. The real thing that pulls veterans together is the fact that if I need help, I know somebody's going to be there to help me. We've seen accidents on the highway and, and people just drive by them. I mean, but it's different, obviously. When I came home from Vietnam, my younger brother, Steve, he went to, he went to Vietnam in 1969 and he was a door gunner on a Huey helicopter that crashed and burned. And I was actually in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And I found out through my TAC officer that he had died. And when I, I, I took my, I had a new son. I took my wife and we drove back to Decatur, Illinois. And the casualty officer did not know that I was still active duty military. And so he came over and he said, would you like to be the body escort for your brother? And my mother came over and put her arm around me and said, yes, he does. And there's an absolute, the best movie I have seen in many, many years called Taking Chance. It's a, it's a HBO documentary or a movie, HBO movie about a true story about a Marine officer who volunteers to escort a body home. And that's exactly what I did. I went out to San Francisco. I went through a day's training. I accepted the body. I got the airport, brought him back home, took him to the, took him to the funeral home. And we decided to have a, the funeral director and I decided it would be best to have a closed casket. And it was one of those things that my mother, to the day she died, she wasn't sure that her son was in there. But, you know, as I came back, I was treated with such honor, such, such respect. But the absolute hardest thing I ever did in my life is because I was the body escort, I was representing the president and America and the honor guard folded the flag. I saluted it. They handed it to me. They saluted it. And then I had to hand it to my mother. And that just was something that I had to do. And I did. I met yesterday with a Vietnam veteran. I met at the Wings over the Rockies Museum. We had a veteran's breakfast earlier this year. And, and we became, instant friends. And we went out to lunch this week and he had signed a confidential agreement. He, there was stuff he couldn't talk about for 40 years. No, time had expired. And I sit and listen to a man pour out his heart for three and a half hours. And it was my day to listen. There are stories that veterans have. You can't, they'll tell you if, if they want to. And this gentleman wanted to. And now I know I have a lifetime friend. Part of what I said earlier was TAPS. TAPS is not Wounded Warriors. They're still alive. TAPS is the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. And it's for the families of our soldiers killed. Even those, and I heard this on your show earlier in a commercial, even those that commit suicide, we take care of their families, their kids, their spouses. It's an absolute wonderful charity. It's been 10 years in Colorado. We've raised several million dollars. It's the highest national rating of any charity where the, the amount of funds that end up assisting the benefits, the benefits, the family for the soldier killed is number one in the nation. That's great. We have an event tomorrow at 4 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. at the Stampede on Havana in Aurora. And we've got several bars, or I'm sorry, we have several bands coming in. They're all Colorado bands, Denver bands, Wildfire, Richie Law. I can't remember all of them, but it's one of those things where it costs $25 to come in per person, $40 for a couple. We'll have a cash bar, hot dogs and hamburgers are also going to be there. But we raise money. And also we're having our annual TAPS thing that's going to be on Friday, June 26th. You can go to taps.org slash events and do that. And the last thing I'd like to share with you is that my wife and I and Bo and Lynn Cuttrell, we are stewards of a memorial. It's like the Vietnam wall and it's mobile, but it's pictures and it's pictures of native Coloradoans killed since 9-11. And there's 103 of them, 102 are men and one is a young lady. It's currently on display at Coors Visitor Center. And then next week we're going to take and put it up into, Jake Jabs is gracious enough, we put it in his corporate office there on 470. By the escalator, it is in color. It has their military pictures and family pictures. It is absolutely amazing. We had a young lady raise enough funds for us recently at a birthday party of all places that is going to allow us to take it to schools all over Colorado. Any event that people would like to have it set up and shown, you can go to www.rememberingourfallen.org and you click on Colorado and you can see it's, I put this thing up, and I take it down. I've done that many times. I know these guys. I know their faces. I talk to them and I kind of think they're listening to me. And they got excited when I took them down and told them I'm going to take you to Coors and set you up in a brewery. So that was a wonderful thing. But I would like to leave you with one thought, if you would. If you ask somebody, do you support our troops? If they say yes, if they just say yes, ask them, how do you support our troops? Do you visit the VA? Do you participate in veterans charity events? Do you at least have a bumper sticker? Do you say the Pledge of Allegiance? Do you reach out your hand and think a veteran? Because if you just say, yes, I support our military, it has a cold ring to it in my heart. I'd like to see people understand the cost of freedom. Well, Nolan, we really appreciate your time this afternoon. We appreciate your service. TAPS is a wonderful organization. So the information there is taps.org slash events. And Vietnam veterans, isn't there something that we're going around and it's just saying thank you. And it's a long overdue thank you. But thank you. We greatly appreciate the sacrifice. We appreciate what you've done. You know, Molly and I think every day that we stand on the shoulders of giants. And so we're trying to at least help out and do our part by getting your information out here because our young people need to hear Don. They need to hear Jim. They need to hear you. So thank you so much. I'm just absolutely honored. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Nolan. And thank you for the time that you're spending with the children right now. I know he's spending a lot of time talking to the kids about what's going on. And that's great because a lot don't seem to know that, like you said, they didn't know what a draft was. They're not familiar with it. Different things that happened historically because some people are changing history books. So I'm glad for people like Nolan that are talking to our children about the military and about the sacrifice that is required to secure the blessings of liberty for our future. We'll be right back. Welcome back to Heart of the Matter. I'm Kim Munson here with my good friend Molly Vogt. And we are doing a tribute to our combat veterans in honor of Memorial Day. We're honored to have Don Whipple in studio with us. We talked with Jim Doyle earlier, Nolan Hargrave. But I did want to first of all give a shout out to Predovich and Company. They're good friends of ours, Molly. And they're a full service certified public accounting firm. They provided tax, accounting, and other services to the Denver community since 1989. Dan Predovich is a second generation native Coloraduan and founder of this family operated firm. And the team of Predovich and Company are experienced in working with individuals, businesses, nonprofits, public companies, trusts, and estates. They do everything, Molly. So visit their website at dpredovich.com. That's D-P-R-E-D-O-V-I-C-H.com. Or call for a no charge, no obligation appointment at 303-791-3000. Awesome. So is somebody on the line, Molly? Oh, wait, wait. I had one thing I was supposed to share. That's right. Hey, Kathy, thank you for the great text. This is what Kathy says. Awesome show. Inspiring, informative, and touching. What a wonderful country we live in. So proud of our veterans. Gratitude to them all. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Thanks to Kathy for sharing that. Ellie Reynolds, are you here with us today? Yes. Thanks so much for joining us. You are the president of the Denver Metro Young Republicans, correct? Yeah. And thanks for having me on. And thank you for your service, Dawn. Awesome. Well, tell us what's going on. Yeah. So we're Denver Metro Young Republicans is putting together a tribute and a benefit, going to be kind of a presentation and an event at View House downtown on Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day. It's going to be the View House right next to Coors Field. We're going to have games, prizes, and 100% of the benefits is going to go to Wounded Warriors Impacting Neighbors. Great. Awesome. That's awesome. I see your Facebook page here, so everybody can check that out. And I just posted it on the AmeriChicks Facebook page, so you can see that. So that will be just great. Tuesday, 6 o'clock, View House, downtown Denver, and $10 at the door. The proceeds benefit Wounded Warriors. Yes. And we're going to have a beer pong tournament that's buy-in, and all that money is going back to Wounded Warriors as well. We're going to have multiple different uniforms on display. And Wounded Warriors, Impacting Neighbors, is actually an organization that's post-9-11, and it's going towards post-9-11 veterans, which is really near and dear to our generation's heart. So we're kind of really trying to tie that in and make it a fun event where we can bring quite a bit of people in, get good exposure for the Young Republicans group, and at the same time, all the benefits are going towards good cause. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Ellie. We appreciate it. We'll see you Tuesday night. Yeah. Good to talk to you, Ellie. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. You know, as we wrap it up, this has been a wonderful show, talking about our military. I've got to give a shout-out to some family members, because I wanted to let you know that the Vogt family has actually covered air, land, and sea for our country as well, and I'm very proud of that. My grandfather served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. He was a CB, and he was a combat construction worker, and he was literally right behind the Marines building infrastructures for the fighting force. And he was wounded twice. The second, a sniper's bullet caused an operation. He was in a oxygen tank he was using to weld something to explode. It broke his leg, but he lived, thank goodness. But, you know, he used a cane to get around a little while. Also, my Uncle Tom fought, he flew in the U.S. Air Force as a fighter pilot. He flew the F-4 Phantom, and his first tour in Southeast Asia was at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, second tour at Udon in Northern Thailand. So I wanted to give a shout-out to them as well. He flew in the U.S. Air Force as a SAC bomber pilot, and he hauled around atomic weapons, which is, of course, fabulous and very needed. Flew all around North Africa and Europe during the North Korean War. He was not in it. He was flying during that and scaring the Russians. So after that, he joined the Air National Guard and flew fighter pilots out of Seward at Nashville and went to Vanderbilt Law School after that and then became an entrepreneur. So my family has a lot of wonderful patriots. I just wanted to share that with you all and say thank you so much, and it's near and dear to my heart to everybody that risks so much for our great country. And I'd like to say thank you. My dad was Air Force, and my two uncles were served in the European theater. And one of my uncles served, did a number of bombing missions over the Balkans, and I think he did about 42 missions and was back farming by the time he was 21 years old. Leonard, to sit here with Don Whipple, Jim Doyle, what a great generation they are. Yes. I forgot to add my uncle Jim. I'm so sorry, because he was in the Army. Okay. And he was supposed to send me his information, and he did not, but he was in the Army, and he spent a lot of time in Germany. So there, Uncle Jim, thanks to you as well. Good for you. Right. So as we sign off, is it okay if we go back and ask Don just to talk to us real quick about a couple quotes that he wanted to share? Absolutely. He was the commander of the Pacific Fleet during World War II, and he was on the beaches there, or a deck of a ship or somewhere, and he was talking to a correspondent, and he said, all the men who were on Iwo Jima, it could be said about them, common valor was a common virtue. And I think I've never been around so much courageous, many courageous people in my life. The corpsmen and the coxswains and the boats and landing, they are just out of this world. Corpsmen are all of our heroes in the Marine Corps. But talking about heroes, I think the real heroes of any war are mothers and wives of, excuse me, guys who are out in the fields. Right. They're the real heroes. They have no way of seeing or doing anything about what's happening and I know my mother prayed me through World War II. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Don Whipple, this has just been a really special show, and I would encourage every one of us to get down on our knees this Memorial Day and pray for our soldiers and say thank you for the sacrifices that were made for us so that we can pass on the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. And there are bad guys out there, and our positive quote of the week, or maybe it's just a real one, but a real quote of the week, George Washington, this is what he said. He said, Amen, George Washington. Thank you again to all the amazing soldiers who put it on the line to secure the blessings of liberty. We stand on the soldiers of giants as Kim said earlier. Thank you to Don Whipple, Jim Doyle, Nolan Hargrave, and to the thousands of the rest of you who have sacrificed, are sacrificing, and will sacrifice for us. Your service is appreciated. Thank you. This is the AmeriChick signing off.
