{"text": " One of the more annoying things to me about the CFL bulbs is the way they die. Some of them have died in some kind of scary ways. Like I've turned a light on and then had it pop and smoke. I've had those things smoke before, and that scares me. Yeah, but now that might be the newer ones. Like I said, the older ones, I've got quite a few fixtures around with them, and they've lasted for years and years and years. Laura, thanks for sharing your experience. Appreciate hearing from you tonight at 855-450-FREE. I've had one of those spirally CFL things snap off in my hand when I was trying to unscrew it from the light bulb. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah, that's delightful. Because they're easy to grab sort of at the top and turn, almost like a Phillips head. I was turning it gently, too, because I know that there's only two little stalks when it comes out of the spiral. And I'm just turning, and it just breaks off, and it's just like, ah! Ian, you read a story one time about some incandescent bulb that had been burning like 130 years or something. Oh, really? That sounds familiar. Yeah. That's actually this guy. Oh. This is the guy who found a loophole around the incandescent bulb? Yeah, the guy who found a loophole around it. Actually, there's a video was on this article of him demonstrating one of the original Edison bulbs that he happens to own. He has his own little museum of light bulbs at his company, which makes sense, because he's only one of two people who are awarded a license to produce these bulbs in the country, these new incandescent ones. So he says, oh, the rough duty bulbs. Yeah, the rough service. Yeah. So he says, overall, they're not any different than bulbs over the years. New incandescent bulb does, however, last 12 times longer than the traditional bulb. Wow. Probably because the filament's supported. You know, there's no vibration or whatever to mess with it. So he says that's about 10,000 hours based on three hours of use per day. And he says, in addition to providing the traditional look and feel, you know, new incandescent's warm up like traditional bulbs can be used in places like chicken coops, Mark. He says the new incandescent is safer. I was using a 100 watt and a chicken coop in order to keep it, you know, warm enough. Well, he says it's safer than CFLs, because you can't use CFLs in chicken coops. Why not? Because they don't put off heat. Oh, so you can use them. They do a little bit, but not near as much. You can, they just aren't of any use. Okay, gotcha. Right, right, right. Sorry, I'm like, why the hell can't you? Right. The new incandescent website cites various side effects of CFLs. Including, he says, epilepsy, migraines, cancer, and lupus. I'd say that's a stretch. I'd say maybe the migraines. I could see migraines. I could see headaches. And maybe even epilepsy. Once they, you know, when they start dying and they start doing that flicker thing and it's like a strobe light, I bet that could potentially cause a seizure. Yeah, I could see that. He says, but even- Lupus, I don't know about that one. It's always lupus. But even Birnbaum, a diehard fan of incandescence, thinks newer lighting technology is worth investigating, investing his time. He's working on developing LED that gives off the look of an incandescent. Well, people have beat you to the punch there. Part of the challenge is making sure it's inexpensive compared to the others on the market. We're trying to make it available to the average person. When you break it down, it's actually a lot cheaper than CFLs he added to the current new incandescent bulb. New incandescent bulbs range from $2.88 to $7.50. LEDs start off at around $10 and heads up into the teens. Yeah, I'm hoping. It didn't used to be that way. I mean, LEDs just a few years ago were $30, $40, $50. Like $30, $40 bulbs, yeah. So, I mean, they're coming down pretty dramatically and you can get them sub $10 no problem at Home Depot. Hey, I can't wait until we can find this like Sylvania thing that you had where you can get, you know, eight of them for $3. For LED bulbs would be sweet. That would be fantastic. Yeah, and that's why I don't recommend switching out a whole household at once. I mean, because if you've got working bulbs- If you've got working bulbs, I wouldn't do it either. I don't think it's that big a deal because these bulbs are going to last for like 20 or 30 years. A lot of people, like I talked to somebody here in Keene who like was not willing to switch out their bulbs because they're in an apartment that they just don't care about. And I'm like, dude, take the bulbs with you, you know, and leave the cheap CFLs behind. Just go out and buy a pack of cheap CFLs when you move and take your bulbs with you because they last like 20, 30 years. They're supposed to last for, I don't know, what is it? How many hours is an LED bulb supposed to last for? I mean, could they possibly- Ridiculous. They're just estimating. Right. Here, 100,000 hours. How could you possibly have known that it would last 100,000 hours? Right. I mean, that's what they say on like computer, a lot of computer equipment claims it'll last, you know, 100,000 hours. Right. I don't know how they- How do you get that number? I guess you can look at the wear on the equipment over time and kind of- Or maybe who knows how long they've been developing it, you know, that type of thing too. I suppose. So anyway, there you go. Light bulbs, there apparently is a workaround. You have to get a rough service board. Like, oh my God, this band's coming up. Go on, buy your light bulbs. And they're freaking out. I'm like, it's not that big a deal. First of all, because of LED bulbs, which I love. And, you know, second of all, because there's this guy who found his loophole. There's always a loophole, isn't there? Yeah. No. No, there's not always a loophole. How about income tax? A loophole? Well, I don't know. There's millions of people who don't pay it. I don't know if that's a loophole or not. There's all kinds of people that know the ins and the outs of that system. And there are certainly people that know the ins and the outs of that system. And the ins and outs get a better deal than those that don't. You know, rich people with fancy attorneys and fancy accountants, those people are doing better than the average person on taxes. Are they not? As a percentage? No. Rich people pay more of the tax. The top 40% of renters- No, actually, poor people pay more taxes than rich people. Not income tax. Okay, but over in general, poor people pay more in taxes. As a percentage of their income, I'd say that's probably true. Yeah. When you're talking about gas taxes. Because they don't know the loopholes, and they don't have the attorneys, and they don't have the accountants. There's a lot of excise taxes, which don't change for the amount that you pay. Plus, poor people are more likely to smoke. Fact is, if you know how to work the system, you can get a better deal than the people that don't know how to work the system. Well, learning how to work the system is a job in and of itself, and yes, it pays. That's why rich people pay people that know the system to work it for them. Indeed. So, speaking of people that know the system, Hillary Clinton, she's going on a tour, according to the Washington Times. That's right. She is on a mission. She's on a mission. Soon, and I think it's kind of an indicator, right? Like, you know, people are losing their belief in the state. Yeah, the numbers are going up. They're bringing out the big guns here. Oh, Hillary Clinton, she's going to save the state. We'll see how that works out. No, she's not. 855-453. That's 855-450-3733. Yeah, all she's going to do is talk to the choir. She's going to, you know, preach to people that already agree with her about the state. People that are angry about the state are probably not going to want to listen to what she says.

I don't know what they call them. I guess a droney would be a victim of a drone. We should ask some weather fanatics to call in if they're about our break. Make argument here about whether or not at any time in recent history, Keene, New Hampshire has actually seen negative 20 temperatures. Good question. Weather.com would know. We were fighting about this on the break. They do have history. Old people. That's the thing about weather is there is history, so you can go back and find out what weather was at some point. Anyway, our number here is 855-450-FREE. And, of course, you can join us on Skype. Our Skype username is LRN.FM. Mark, you brought in a story about drones that you wanted to share with us tonight. Yeah, this one is a story out of The Guardian from TheGuardian.com. And it says what the public should know what really goes on. A few of the politicians who brazenly proclaim the benefits of drones have no real clue as to actually how it works and doesn't. It's written by Heather Leinbaugh, like I said again, at TheGuardian.com. I'd like to read comments by politicians defending the unmanned aerial vehicle Predator and Reaper program, a.k.a. drones. I wish I could ask them a few questions. I'd start with how many women and children have you seen incinerated by a Hellfire missile? This is someone who was a drone worker. Yes. He controlled and piloted them. Yeah, I think that it's written by a woman and it's written in the first person. So I get the impression that this is the author of this was in fact a drone pilot. Got it. So I'm not entirely sure, but that's the impression I got. How many men have you seen crawl across the field trying to make it to the nearest compound for help while bleeding out from severed legs? Or even more poignantly, how many soldiers have you seen die on the side of the road in Afghanistan because our ever so accurate UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, were unable to detect an IED, improvised explosive device, that awaited their convoy? Politicians who so brazenly proclaim the benefits of drones have a real clue of what actually goes on. I, on the other hand, have seen these awful sights firsthand. I knew the names of some of the young soldiers I saw bleed to death on the side of the road. I watched dozens of military-aged males die in Afghanistan in empty fields along riversides and some right outside the compound where their family was waiting for them to return home from the mosque. The U.S. and British militaries insist that this is an expert program, but it's curious that they feel the need to deliver that faulty information with few or no statistics about civilian deaths and twisted technology reports and the capabilities of our UAVs. These specific incidents are not isolated, and the civilian casualty rate has not changed, despite what our defense representatives might like to tell us. So, just as many people are dying, they haven't, according to this author who is a, was a drone pilot and intimate with the drone program, the fact is, is that civilian deaths haven't diminished over time. They're still killing just as many. And I'm, and as we read here, you're going to find out why. What the public needs to understand is that video provided by a drone is not usually clear enough to detect someone carrying a weapon, or even on a crystal clear day with limited cloud and perfect light. This makes it incredibly difficult for the best analyst to identify if someone has a weapon for sure. One example comes to mind, the feed's so pixelated, this is in quotations here, the feed's so pixelated, what if that's a shovel and not a weapon? I felt this confusion constantly, as I did my, as did my fellow UAV analysts. Analysts. We also wonder if we killed the right people, if we endangered the wrong people, if we destroyed an innocent civilian's life, all because of a bad image or angle. Listen to me, war hawks. They can't tell the difference between a shovel and an AK-47. That's how much this air, these remote control airplanes with cameras and bombs stink. They can't tell the difference, according to the pilots. Now, I know I'm not going to get a single one of you calling in and talking about what brave people are in the military, tonight, because this is obviously crazy. They're killing people with shovels. Well, Mark, they're clearly terrorists. I mean, terrorists wouldn't be out on the streets, or terrorists wouldn't, uh, never mind. I don't know where I was going with that. I don't, look, the fact is, they have to have, statistically have to have killed some bad guys, right? Probably. But we don't know how many bad guys versus how many good guys, because you're getting your information from the people who did the killing. It's a terrible story. It's a terrible source of information. If somebody kills somebody, they do not want to believe they killed the wrong person. It's also important for the public to grasp that these are human. I don't know. I bet that there's a lot of people in the military that don't care. Just don't care? Yeah, they don't care whether or not they killed the right person or the wrong person. I should hope not. Unless they're brown. Oh, yeah, those people are definitely in the military. I mean, there are people who join the military because they know they can legally kill people. Right. Sure. And I'm sure for some of them, it doesn't even matter if they're brown. But I don't think that... Yeah, I get to kill some people today. I think they want to do it through remote control airplanes, though. Those people want to participate in the act of killing right there on the ground. I think you'd probably find both of those types of people. So it says that these are human beings operating and analyzing intelligence with these UAVs. I like how this person is so addicted to, we're all analysts. We're analyzing. That's the title. Well, yeah, I know. But it's that brainwashing, that training is still stuck with them that they have to call them analysts. Right, you're not a remote murderer. You're not a remote control plane pilot. We're analysts. We're analyzing the data that's been provided to us. No, you're not. I know because I was... You're staring at a screen in a remote control plane, flying a plane that shoots missiles. I'm not sure whether the analysts fly the planes. I really haven't been able to figure that out from this story. I don't know what the titles mean. I know because I was one of them, and nothing can prepare you for an almost daily routine of flying combat aerial surveillance missions. There you go. Over a war zone. Excuse me. Many proponents claim that troops who do this kind of work are not affected by observing this combat because they're never directly in physical danger. That is nonsense. Have you heard videos of these analysts? Because I have. I mean, it sounds something like, you know, Roger, the target is in sight. Yep. Over. Target appears to be carrying some kind of a weapon. Can we get any kind of a positive identification on the weapon? Do I have a go for target acquisition? May I commence firing? Commencing firing. I mean, it's like there's no, you know, like it's this completely disconnected, like cold-blooded... I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable. When in doubt, fire. Right. It's probably their policy. Well, I don't know what their policy is, but, you know, the fact is... If they're when in doubt, it's ticket for the parking enforcers. That's their policy. To a man with a hammer. Well, that's the thing is, is that there's no doubt, no doubt been, you know, bad kills. And probably the worst thing is, is that they're actually going and doing these double taps, which is when they drop a bomb and they kill a few people, other people rush in to help them and then they drop the bombs again. This is just a horrifying thing to do. Well, that's what they get for carrying a shovel in to help somebody. Right. Just digging a ditch or whatever it is that they're doing. Here's the one thing. I may not have been on the ground in Afghanistan, but I watched parts of the conflict in great detail on a screen for days on end. And I think absolutely drone pilots can get PTSD. Of course, what they do affects them. I mean, just people who are there taking pictures. The press will get PTSD from these situations. Well, I mean, gosh, to know that your actions have resulted in the death, the violent death of innocent people, that's got to be absolutely horrifying. Yep. She says, I know the feeling you experience when you see someone die. Horrifying barely covers it. And when you're exposed to it over and over again, because it's like a small video embedded in your head, forever on repeat, causing psychological pain and suffering that many people will hopefully never experience. UAV troops are victim not only to the haunting memories of this work that they carry with them, but also to the guilt of always being a little unsure of how accurate their confirmations were of weapons and identification of hostile individuals. I think that it's one of these things that you talk about these guys getting PTSD, these analysts who fly these drones. That as it is, I'm sure that that's a major part of the reason why they're doing this is because they're so disconnected. And it's, again, it's kind of the same thing with a lot of these cops that are, you know, this militarization of things is that there's this disconnection, you know, with, for example, with the tasers and whatnot, or with these drones or whatnot. There's this level of removal from what they're actually doing. And especially with these drones, PTSD is, I would say a lot of it is that you're in this situation where you're killing other people, but you're also fearing for your own safety. There's a lot of neurochemicals that are, you're getting amped up. We're like, oh my God, I might die any second. I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting. And that's where you're really going to get PTSD. When you're playing a video game, this is essentially what I'm sure the feel to this is, even though there's the consequences of someone dying, there's a huge amount of removal there. 213-493-0308.

Some of them have died in some kind of scary ways. Like I've turned a light on and then had it pop and smoke. I've had those things smoke before, and that scares me. Yeah, but now that might be the newer ones. Like I said, the older ones, I've got quite a few fixtures around with them, and they've lasted for years and years and years. Laura, thanks for sharing your experience. Appreciate hearing from you tonight at 855-450-FREE. I've had one of those spirally CFL things snap off in my hand when I was trying to unscrew it from the light bulb. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah, that's delightful. Because they're easy to grab sort of at the top and turn, almost like a Phillips head. I was turning it gently, too, because I know that there's only two little stalks when it comes out of the spiral. And I'm just turning, and it just breaks off, and it's just like, ah! Ian, you read a story one time about some incandescent bulb that had been burning like 130 years or something. Oh, really? That sounds familiar. Yeah. That's actually this guy. Oh. This is the guy who found a loophole around the incandescent bulb? Yeah, the guy who found a loophole around it. Actually, there's a video was on this article of him demonstrating one of the original Edison bulbs that he happens to own. He has his own little museum of light bulbs at his company, which makes sense, because he's only one of two people who are awarded a license to produce these bulbs in the country, these new incandescent ones. So he says, oh, the rough duty bulbs. Yeah, the rough service. Yeah. So he says, overall, they're not any different than bulbs over the years. New incandescent bulb does, however, last 12 times longer than the traditional bulb. Wow. Probably because the filament's supported. You know, there's no vibration or whatever to mess with it. So he says that's about 10,000 hours based on three hours of use per day. And he says, in addition to providing the traditional look and feel, you know, new incandescent's warm up like traditional bulbs can be used in places like chicken coops, Mark. He says the new incandescent is safer. I was using a 100 watt and a chicken coop in order to keep it, you know, warm enough. Well, he says it's safer than CFLs, because you can't use CFLs in chicken coops. Why not? Because they don't put off heat. Oh, so you can use them. They do a little bit, but not near as much. You can, they just aren't of any use. Okay, gotcha. Right, right, right. Sorry, I'm like, why the hell can't you? Right. The new incandescent website cites various side effects of CFLs. Including, he says, epilepsy, migraines, cancer, and lupus. I'd say that's a stretch. I'd say maybe the migraines. I could see migraines. I could see headaches. And maybe even epilepsy. Once they, you know, when they start dying and they start doing that flicker thing and it's like a strobe light, I bet that could potentially cause a seizure. Yeah, I could see that. He says, but even- Lupus, I don't know about that one. It's always lupus. But even Birnbaum, a diehard fan of incandescence, thinks newer lighting technology is worth investigating, investing his time. He's working on developing LED that gives off the look of an incandescent. Well, people have beat you to the punch there. Part of the challenge is making sure it's inexpensive compared to the others on the market. We're trying to make it available to the average person. When you break it down, it's actually a lot cheaper than CFLs he added to the current new incandescent bulb. New incandescent bulbs range from $2.88 to $7.50. LEDs start off at around $10 and heads up into the teens. Yeah, I'm hoping. It didn't used to be that way. I mean, LEDs just a few years ago were $30, $40, $50. Like $30, $40 bulbs, yeah. So, I mean, they're coming down pretty dramatically and you can get them sub $10 no problem at Home Depot. Hey, I can't wait until we can find this like Sylvania thing that you had where you can get, you know, eight of them for $3. For LED bulbs would be sweet. That would be fantastic. Yeah, and that's why I don't recommend switching out a whole household at once. I mean, because if you've got working bulbs- If you've got working bulbs, I wouldn't do it either. I don't think it's that big a deal because these bulbs are going to last for like 20 or 30 years. A lot of people, like I talked to somebody here in Keene who like was not willing to switch out their bulbs because they're in an apartment that they just don't care about. And I'm like, dude, take the bulbs with you, you know, and leave the cheap CFLs behind. Just go out and buy a pack of cheap CFLs when you move and take your bulbs with you because they last like 20, 30 years. They're supposed to last for, I don't know, what is it? How many hours is an LED bulb supposed to last for? I mean, could they possibly- Ridiculous. They're just estimating. Right. Here, 100,000 hours. How could you possibly have known that it would last 100,000 hours? Right. I mean, that's what they say on like computer, a lot of computer equipment claims it'll last, you know, 100,000 hours. Right. I don't know how they- How do you get that number? I guess you can look at the wear on the equipment over time and kind of- Or maybe who knows how long they've been developing it, you know, that type of thing too. I suppose. So anyway, there you go. Light bulbs, there apparently is a workaround. You have to get a rough service board. Like, oh my God, this band's coming up. Go on, buy your light bulbs. And they're freaking out. I'm like, it's not that big a deal. First of all, because of LED bulbs, which I love. And, you know, second of all, because there's this guy who found his loophole. There's always a loophole, isn't there? Yeah. No. No, there's not always a loophole. How about income tax? A loophole? Well, I don't know. There's millions of people who don't pay it. I don't know if that's a loophole or not. There's all kinds of people that know the ins and the outs of that system. And there are certainly people that know the ins and the outs of that system. And the ins and outs get a better deal than those that don't. You know, rich people with fancy attorneys and fancy accountants, those people are doing better than the average person on taxes. Are they not? As a percentage? No. Rich people pay more of the tax. The top 40% of renters- No, actually, poor people pay more taxes than rich people. Not income tax. Okay, but over in general, poor people pay more in taxes. As a percentage of their income, I'd say that's probably true. Yeah. When you're talking about gas taxes. Because they don't know the loopholes, and they don't have the attorneys, and they don't have the accountants. There's a lot of excise taxes, which don't change for the amount that you pay. Plus, poor people are more likely to smoke. Fact is, if you know how to work the system, you can get a better deal than the people that don't know how to work the system. Well, learning how to work the system is a job in and of itself, and yes, it pays. That's why rich people pay people that know the system to work it for them. Indeed. So, speaking of people that know the system, Hillary Clinton, she's going on a tour, according to the Washington Times. That's right. She is on a mission. She's on a mission. Soon, and I think it's kind of an indicator, right? Like, you know, people are losing their belief in the state. Yeah, the numbers are going up. They're bringing out the big guns here. Oh, Hillary Clinton, she's going to save the state. We'll see how that works out. No, she's not. 855-453. That's 855-450-3733. Yeah, all she's going to do is talk to the choir. She's going to, you know, preach to people that already agree with her about the state. People that are angry about the state are probably not going to want to listen to what she says.

I don't know what they call them. I guess a droney would be a victim of a drone. We should ask some weather fanatics to call in if they're about our break. Make argument here about whether or not at any time in recent history, Keene, New Hampshire has actually seen negative 20 temperatures. Good question. Weather.com would know. We were fighting about this on the break. They do have history. Old people. That's the thing about weather is there is history, so you can go back and find out what weather was at some point. Anyway, our number here is 855-450-FREE. And, of course, you can join us on Skype. Our Skype username is LRN.FM. Mark, you brought in a story about drones that you wanted to share with us tonight. Yeah, this one is a story out of The Guardian from TheGuardian.com. And it says what the public should know what really goes on. A few of the politicians who brazenly proclaim the benefits of drones have no real clue as to actually how it works and doesn't. It's written by Heather Leinbaugh, like I said again, at TheGuardian.com. I'd like to read comments by politicians defending the unmanned aerial vehicle Predator and Reaper program, a.k.a. drones. I wish I could ask them a few questions. I'd start with how many women and children have you seen incinerated by a Hellfire missile? This is someone who was a drone worker. Yes. He controlled and piloted them. Yeah, I think that it's written by a woman and it's written in the first person. So I get the impression that this is the author of this was in fact a drone pilot. Got it. So I'm not entirely sure, but that's the impression I got. How many men have you seen crawl across the field trying to make it to the nearest compound for help while bleeding out from severed legs? Or even more poignantly, how many soldiers have you seen die on the side of the road in Afghanistan because our ever so accurate UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, were unable to detect an IED, improvised explosive device, that awaited their convoy? Politicians who so brazenly proclaim the benefits of drones have a real clue of what actually goes on. I, on the other hand, have seen these awful sights firsthand. I knew the names of some of the young soldiers I saw bleed to death on the side of the road. I watched dozens of military-aged males die in Afghanistan in empty fields along riversides and some right outside the compound where their family was waiting for them to return home from the mosque. The U.S. and British militaries insist that this is an expert program, but it's curious that they feel the need to deliver that faulty information with few or no statistics about civilian deaths and twisted technology reports and the capabilities of our UAVs. These specific incidents are not isolated, and the civilian casualty rate has not changed, despite what our defense representatives might like to tell us. So, just as many people are dying, they haven't, according to this author who is a, was a drone pilot and intimate with the drone program, the fact is, is that civilian deaths haven't diminished over time. They're still killing just as many. And I'm, and as we read here, you're going to find out why. What the public needs to understand is that video provided by a drone is not usually clear enough to detect someone carrying a weapon, or even on a crystal clear day with limited cloud and perfect light. This makes it incredibly difficult for the best analyst to identify if someone has a weapon for sure. One example comes to mind, the feed's so pixelated, this is in quotations here, the feed's so pixelated, what if that's a shovel and not a weapon? I felt this confusion constantly, as I did my, as did my fellow UAV analysts. Analysts. We also wonder if we killed the right people, if we endangered the wrong people, if we destroyed an innocent civilian's life, all because of a bad image or angle. Listen to me, war hawks. They can't tell the difference between a shovel and an AK-47. That's how much this air, these remote control airplanes with cameras and bombs stink. They can't tell the difference, according to the pilots. Now, I know I'm not going to get a single one of you calling in and talking about what brave people are in the military, tonight, because this is obviously crazy. They're killing people with shovels. Well, Mark, they're clearly terrorists. I mean, terrorists wouldn't be out on the streets, or terrorists wouldn't, uh, never mind. I don't know where I was going with that. I don't, look, the fact is, they have to have, statistically have to have killed some bad guys, right? Probably. But we don't know how many bad guys versus how many good guys, because you're getting your information from the people who did the killing. It's a terrible story. It's a terrible source of information. If somebody kills somebody, they do not want to believe they killed the wrong person. It's also important for the public to grasp that these are human. I don't know. I bet that there's a lot of people in the military that don't care. Just don't care? Yeah, they don't care whether or not they killed the right person or the wrong person. I should hope not. Unless they're brown. Oh, yeah, those people are definitely in the military. I mean, there are people who join the military because they know they can legally kill people. Right. Sure. And I'm sure for some of them, it doesn't even matter if they're brown. But I don't think that... Yeah, I get to kill some people today. I think they want to do it through remote control airplanes, though. Those people want to participate in the act of killing right there on the ground. I think you'd probably find both of those types of people. So it says that these are human beings operating and analyzing intelligence with these UAVs. I like how this person is so addicted to, we're all analysts. We're analyzing. That's the title. Well, yeah, I know. But it's that brainwashing, that training is still stuck with them that they have to call them analysts. Right, you're not a remote murderer. You're not a remote control plane pilot. We're analysts. We're analyzing the data that's been provided to us. No, you're not. I know because I was... You're staring at a screen in a remote control plane, flying a plane that shoots missiles. I'm not sure whether the analysts fly the planes. I really haven't been able to figure that out from this story. I don't know what the titles mean. I know because I was one of them, and nothing can prepare you for an almost daily routine of flying combat aerial surveillance missions. There you go. Over a war zone. Excuse me. Many proponents claim that troops who do this kind of work are not affected by observing this combat because they're never directly in physical danger. That is nonsense. Have you heard videos of these analysts? Because I have. I mean, it sounds something like, you know, Roger, the target is in sight. Yep. Over. Target appears to be carrying some kind of a weapon. Can we get any kind of a positive identification on the weapon? Do I have a go for target acquisition? May I commence firing? Commencing firing. I mean, it's like there's no, you know, like it's this completely disconnected, like cold-blooded... I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable. When in doubt, fire. Right. It's probably their policy. Well, I don't know what their policy is, but, you know, the fact is... If they're when in doubt, it's ticket for the parking enforcers. That's their policy. To a man with a hammer. Well, that's the thing is, is that there's no doubt, no doubt been, you know, bad kills. And probably the worst thing is, is that they're actually going and doing these double taps, which is when they drop a bomb and they kill a few people, other people rush in to help them and then they drop the bombs again. This is just a horrifying thing to do. Well, that's what they get for carrying a shovel in to help somebody. Right. Just digging a ditch or whatever it is that they're doing. Here's the one thing. I may not have been on the ground in Afghanistan, but I watched parts of the conflict in great detail on a screen for days on end. And I think absolutely drone pilots can get PTSD. Of course, what they do affects them. I mean, just people who are there taking pictures. The press will get PTSD from these situations. Well, I mean, gosh, to know that your actions have resulted in the death, the violent death of innocent people, that's got to be absolutely horrifying. Yep. She says, I know the feeling you experience when you see someone die. Horrifying barely covers it. And when you're exposed to it over and over again, because it's like a small video embedded in your head, forever on repeat, causing psychological pain and suffering that many people will hopefully never experience. UAV troops are victim not only to the haunting memories of this work that they carry with them, but also to the guilt of always being a little unsure of how accurate their confirmations were of weapons and identification of hostile individuals. I think that it's one of these things that you talk about these guys getting PTSD, these analysts who fly these drones. That as it is, I'm sure that that's a major part of the reason why they're doing this is because they're so disconnected. And it's, again, it's kind of the same thing with a lot of these cops that are, you know, this militarization of things is that there's this disconnection, you know, with, for example, with the tasers and whatnot, or with these drones or whatnot. There's this level of removal from what they're actually doing. And especially with these drones, PTSD is, I would say a lot of it is that you're in this situation where you're killing other people, but you're also fearing for your own safety. There's a lot of neurochemicals that are, you're getting amped up. We're like, oh my God, I might die any second. I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting. And that's where you're really going to get PTSD. When you're playing a video game, this is essentially what I'm sure the feel to this is, even though there's the consequences of someone dying, there's a huge amount of removal there. 213-493-0308.
