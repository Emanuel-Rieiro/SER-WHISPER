{"text": " So welcome to the SU show here on Braford Radio and this week I'm joined again by the fantastic Miss Fox. Hello Janine, how are you? Hello, good thank you. So today I wanted to discuss, there's a referendum going around, it's not on Facebook, I've seen posters around campus. What is this referendum all about? Basically, a while back one of the senior management team at the university contacted me about the potential of having a no smoking campus and what the SU's opinions on it were. And we said it affects everybody across the board so widely and it affects some people really deeply as well. So we said it's not for the officers to decide, we're going to take it to student council and then we would hold a cross campus referendum on it and get the opinions of all students and give everybody a chance to have their say. So it was discussed at council when it was decided that we should propose that smoking zones were introduced on campus to prevent congregation around entrance to the libraries and stuff like that. And so now the question that we're posing to our student body is should there be smoking zones introduced on campus, yes or no? So all you have to do is log on to the SU website to vote, simple yes or no, and depending on what the outcome of that will be will determine whether it's something that the SU officers fight for on behalf of the students. But there's been a lot of debate. I know I've got quite a few friends who smoke and a lot of people are sort of quite concerned that it's all sort of, it's as if you're bunching all the smokers in a little box if you're having smoking areas. But yet other people who don't smoke think it's great because, as you say, especially outside the library, you know, with those late night sessions or along the main buildings and things, other people sort of find it always get a bit much this cloud of smoke you have to walk through. Have you had mixed reactions, you know, coming to the SU because of this? Yeah, we've had a lot of mixed reactions because, and to be honest, we knew we would, which is why we wanted to give it to the whole of the Lincoln students kind of population to help form a decision. Because it isn't something that I think a group of students can decide. Everybody needs to be consulted. That, yeah, we have had students that have said that you're just confining smokers to an area, you're singling them out from, you know, their community, you know, you're causing a scene, you're creating a stigma. Then we have other people that have said it should be completely no smoking whatsoever. Smoking offends them if they, you know, they don't want smoke anywhere near them. And so, yeah, we have had a complete mixed reaction, which is why the SU just wanted to throw the decision back into the student body to make the decision so that we can fight for what's, what, well, what Lincoln students think is right. So essentially a referendum, as I understand it, is simply a yes or no vote. You don't have to vote for multiple options. It's just yes or no. It's just, yeah, for this, yeah, referendum is just a yes or no answer. So it's really, really simple. So literally whatever the outcome is, we will, we will act on that basically. And say, for example, most, the majority of students, I'll first clarify, is it only students who can vote in this? Yeah, it's only students that can vote. But we are contacting the teaching unions, places like Unisun and UCU just to contact them and say, look, this is, this is happening. And the decision could ultimately affect your, your workers. So staff are being considered as well. But I mean, this place exists for students. So that's what we're here for. Okay. Okay. And so say, for example, it does end up with a yes, there should be smoking zones introduced on campus. What will happen? Does that mean there definitely will be smoking zones or is it still a bit up in the air? It's still a bit up in the air because it won't be the students union that actually provides the smoking zones. It will be something that the university does. But it will be something that the, the SU officers would be committed to fighting for. We, because we would have the evidence that this is what students want. So we can go to the university staff and say, this is what students want. Here's your proof. Here's the evidence. When's it going to happen? You know, we've spoken about it before. And I don't, I, I mean, I can understand everybody's opinions. Everybody always has a good debate when they come back to us. But as long as we've got that hard evidence, to say, right, the majority want this, then that's what we'll go with. And we'll, yeah, we will, we will talk to the university. We will negotiate with them, see how we can help them out in the process. But it will be the university delivering it, not the students union. And do we have any sort of more details at this stage, for example, timescale? So the referendum is all this week, Monday to Friday? It's, it's open this morning at 9am. It closes on Thursday afternoon at 12pm. So the results, will be released at 6pm on Thursday online and on Twitter, which is exactly the same for our by-elections as well. So it's the voting and results all at the same time. Okay. So say the motion is passed, for example, that there will be smoking zones introduced. So that's announced on Thursday at 6pm. Do we have any sort of idea at this stage? You know, will it be a matter of weeks or will it be after Christmas or will it be next, you know, academic year really before that will come into place? If I'm completely honest with you, we're working in the students union and working with kind of the university has made me realise that everything is so slow moving. And so I don't think you will see the introduction of the zones until probably next September, I would say. But it would be something that the officers would work, be working on straight away. It would be on the agenda from now until it's done really. But yet the, the referendum itself was sort of introduced very quickly. It was, what, two weeks ago when student council was, when it was sort of put to the students and already, you know, so it seems to be, I was surprised when the referendum was announced for being this week. I thought it would be, you know, in a couple of weeks time. Well, originally it was, it was planned. I had hoped for it to be in November and just trying to plan out the times and stuff. But we thought, we figured that if people are voting in the by-elections, why not just do one big kind of voting session so they could vote in the referendum as well as the by-election. So that we're just hoping to, excuse me, increase our voter turnout. So yeah, we thought, why not? Rather than just bombarding students with vote here, vote here, vote for this. We just do it all in one go. Because I think, I don't think it's only at Lincoln. I think it's institutions everywhere really. It's often a struggle to get students to vote on issues. Yeah, definitely. Why do you think that is? It depends on your, your student engagement level as I think. And I think it depends on how much faith they have in the system, students have in the system. Because I often think that if, I mean, when I was campaigning this year, quite a few people said, oh, you know, I don't know what the student union is. I don't know what it does. It doesn't do anything for me. And I just think it's a shame because it obviously either I've not been doing my job right or the union haven't been doing our job right. We haven't been communicating properly to show students what we can do or how we can help them or what opportunities we have available to people. And it's just, it is a shame. But I think that, I mean, often people in sports and society don't even know that they're part of the union. They just see themselves as being part of that specific club. Which I can say, it is a shame, but the more that we can interact with our students, sorry, the better our voter turnout will be. So coinciding with this referendum is the by-election as well. Can you just tell us a bit more about that? Yep. We have the by-election going on at the moment. We have two part-time positions available. One of them is the part-time groups officer. So that role is very much related to the groups that we have in the union. So that's the LGBT, mature and postgraduate students group, disabled students group and the international students group. It will also be chair of the groups council as well. So they'd be very much representing on behalf of those students involved in that and any new groups that come along. We do have one candidate running for that as well as Ron, which is reopen nominations. So if people didn't approve, of the other guy, so that's James Wigger, who's running for the position, then they can always vote for reopen nomination. Excuse me. The second position we have available is officer for students. We have three candidates running for that one who are Kayleigh Coddington, Michael Akande and Callum Watt. So this role is very much a general part-time role. So they can kind of adapt any remit that they want to. So they're very much voted on their manifestos. So whatever they seem to be the highlights for them. So it's very, very important before people vote, they do read the manifestos. So the right person gets elected or who they think the right person should be gets elected. Because there's no clear remit for those roles. It's essentially if, I'm just guessing here, if the student has a particular issue or a particular matter that they wish to resolve, they wish to work on, if there's a particular, you know, part of the university that they want to see change in, they can focus on that. And is that vetted at all by the Students' Union, you know, when they put in their application, for example? So if they want to do something absolutely ridiculous, that can still go ahead if they get voted in? Well, yeah, good question. Obviously, if anything was offensive or, you know, not politically correct or anything like that, then the union would step in. But yeah, if a student wants to come in and has an idea that we, I don't know, dig up all of the architecture grass and make it into a big allotment or something, then we wouldn't tell them not to run on that. They can do what they want. It's just they would probably have quite a hard time pushing the agenda once they are elected. And because they'd have to work with the university, obviously. But yeah, we'd happily, we'd have anyone. So anyone can step forward. I'm online this time. Okay. I suppose something else we can cover is the snowflake ball. That is very exciting. So it was only announced very recently that the very talented, very prestigious, very, you know, world-class Tinchy Strider is performing. I'm assuming he's author of students. I don't know him that well, to be honest. But he's no one name, so he must be good. And it's quite a big thing for a big act to come to Lincoln of all places. It is a big act. And actually, we've had a lot of We've had really, really good feedback on the event so far. Obviously, the event's not even happened. But we've had good feedback on Tinchy Strider in particular. We've had good feedback at the fact that we've actually bought it back because 2011, we didn't have a snowflake ball. And we've had great feedback at the fact that we haven't got some tacky tribute artists like last time. I think it was Black Eyed Tees we had last time. So yeah, the feedback's been great. And we obviously sold some early bird tickets. And when I last checked, which was about 3.30pm today, we only had 20 early bird tickets left. So it's selling fast and people are excited. Those early birds have definitely flown the nest. They definitely have. Definitely. And is there a limit or a cap on the general tickets as well? I mean, are they likely to sell out very quickly? From the feedback that I've been getting, I think they will sell quite quickly. But to be honest, there's no telling. If the early birds are anything to go by, then the event could be sold out. But I'm not sure. Time will tell. Time will tell. I'll be going. I will. I've already got my early bird ticket. I'm excited. I didn't want to miss out on that. Just need to get your dress. I've got this beautiful frock planned out. You'll just have to see it. I can't wait. I love it. I'm going for Snow Queen. You should. You should. Definitely. Yeah. Tell the audience a bit more about Snow King and Snow Queen because that wasn't there at the last Snowflake. No, it wasn't. It was just a bit of fun, I think, that was brought up. And we said, you know, we're talking about American proms and that kind of thing. It is very American. It is very American, but it's very cheesy. And actually, when we spoke about it, we were like, actually, that's not a bad idea. Let's go for it. Because, you know, girls like to, you know, make a big effort when they go to something like this. And so do guys. And, you know, it's just nice to do something a bit different. So we're just like, why not? We'll try it. If it works this year, maybe they can do it again next year. And you can nominate anyone for Snow King or Snow... Absolutely anyone. Yep. And what if someone gets nominated, for example, and they haven't actually bought a ticket, they're not actually at the event? Ah, that would be awkward, wouldn't it? I was thinking about that. Because if anyone could be nominated, anyone can get it. And what if they're not actually there? Could be funny. Who knows? That could be funny. Maybe we'll have to go back and talk about that. Because that would be, more than anything, it would be a massive shame to the person who came second place and they were there. So, yeah. Got it. Yeah. Maybe I'll go and talk to Dan about that and see what we can do to work that out. I'm the background man in this operation. I find all the cracks and then you cement them up. Yeah, I'll do cement work. Excellent. And what else is planned? I mean, basically, Snowflake Ball, you dress up in your fineries, your glad rags, have a bit of a boogie to Tinchy Strider. You have your Snow King, Snow Queen. Is there going to be food? Is there going to be party games? Is there going to be Pass the Parcel? Pass the Parcel in the end, you said. That would be huge, wouldn't it? No, there won't be Pass the Parcel. But we are, more than anything, we're spending a lot of money on the decor of the engine shed. So, we're hoping that when people walk into the engine shed, they just won't recognise it. It's going to be a completely different theme, if you like. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give it away. But if people saw the photos from the graduation ball where it was all black and white, better than that. It'll be better than that.

Hello Janine, how are you? Hello, good thank you. So today I wanted to discuss, there's a referendum going around, it's not on Facebook, I've seen posters around campus. What is this referendum all about? Basically, a while back one of the senior management team at the university contacted me about the potential of having a no smoking campus and what the SU's opinions on it were. And we said it affects everybody across the board so widely and it affects some people really deeply as well. So we said it's not for the officers to decide, we're going to take it to student council and then we would hold a cross campus referendum on it and get the opinions of all students and give everybody a chance to have their say. So it was discussed at council when it was decided that we should propose that smoking zones were introduced on campus to prevent congregation around entrance to the libraries and stuff like that. And so now the question that we're posing to our student body is should there be smoking zones introduced on campus, yes or no? So all you have to do is log on to the SU website to vote, simple yes or no, and depending on what the outcome of that will be will determine whether it's something that the SU officers fight for on behalf of the students. But there's been a lot of debate. I know I've got quite a few friends who smoke and a lot of people are sort of quite concerned that it's all sort of, it's as if you're bunching all the smokers in a little box if you're having smoking areas. But yet other people who don't smoke think it's great because, as you say, especially outside the library, you know, with those late night sessions or along the main buildings and things, other people sort of find it always get a bit much this cloud of smoke you have to walk through. Have you had mixed reactions, you know, coming to the SU because of this? Yeah, we've had a lot of mixed reactions because, and to be honest, we knew we would, which is why we wanted to give it to the whole of the Lincoln students kind of population to help form a decision. Because it isn't something that I think a group of students can decide. Everybody needs to be consulted. That, yeah, we have had students that have said that you're just confining smokers to an area, you're singling them out from, you know, their community, you know, you're causing a scene, you're creating a stigma. Then we have other people that have said it should be completely no smoking whatsoever. Smoking offends them if they, you know, they don't want smoke anywhere near them. And so, yeah, we have had a complete mixed reaction, which is why the SU just wanted to throw the decision back into the student body to make the decision so that we can fight for what's, what, well, what Lincoln students think is right. So essentially a referendum, as I understand it, is simply a yes or no vote. You don't have to vote for multiple options. It's just yes or no. It's just, yeah, for this, yeah, referendum is just a yes or no answer. So it's really, really simple. So literally whatever the outcome is, we will, we will act on that basically. And say, for example, most, the majority of students, I'll first clarify, is it only students who can vote in this? Yeah, it's only students that can vote. But we are contacting the teaching unions, places like Unisun and UCU just to contact them and say, look, this is, this is happening. And the decision could ultimately affect your, your workers. So staff are being considered as well. But I mean, this place exists for students. So that's what we're here for. Okay. Okay. And so say, for example, it does end up with a yes, there should be smoking zones introduced on campus. What will happen? Does that mean there definitely will be smoking zones or is it still a bit up in the air? It's still a bit up in the air because it won't be the students union that actually provides the smoking zones. It will be something that the university does. But it will be something that the, the SU officers would be committed to fighting for. We, because we would have the evidence that this is what students want. So we can go to the university staff and say, this is what students want. Here's your proof. Here's the evidence. When's it going to happen? You know, we've spoken about it before. And I don't, I, I mean, I can understand everybody's opinions. Everybody always has a good debate when they come back to us. But as long as we've got that hard evidence, to say, right, the majority want this, then that's what we'll go with. And we'll, yeah, we will, we will talk to the university. We will negotiate with them, see how we can help them out in the process. But it will be the university delivering it, not the students union. And do we have any sort of more details at this stage, for example, timescale? So the referendum is all this week, Monday to Friday? It's, it's open this morning at 9am. It closes on Thursday afternoon at 12pm. So the results, will be released at 6pm on Thursday online and on Twitter, which is exactly the same for our by-elections as well. So it's the voting and results all at the same time. Okay. So say the motion is passed, for example, that there will be smoking zones introduced. So that's announced on Thursday at 6pm. Do we have any sort of idea at this stage? You know, will it be a matter of weeks or will it be after Christmas or will it be next, you know, academic year really before that will come into place? If I'm completely honest with you, we're working in the students union and working with kind of the university has made me realise that everything is so slow moving. And so I don't think you will see the introduction of the zones until probably next September, I would say. But it would be something that the officers would work, be working on straight away. It would be on the agenda from now until it's done really. But yet the, the referendum itself was sort of introduced very quickly. It was, what, two weeks ago when student council was, when it was sort of put to the students and already, you know, so it seems to be, I was surprised when the referendum was announced for being this week. I thought it would be, you know, in a couple of weeks time. Well, originally it was, it was planned. I had hoped for it to be in November and just trying to plan out the times and stuff. But we thought, we figured that if people are voting in the by-elections, why not just do one big kind of voting session so they could vote in the referendum as well as the by-election. So that we're just hoping to, excuse me, increase our voter turnout. So yeah, we thought, why not? Rather than just bombarding students with vote here, vote here, vote for this. We just do it all in one go. Because I think, I don't think it's only at Lincoln. I think it's institutions everywhere really. It's often a struggle to get students to vote on issues. Yeah, definitely. Why do you think that is? It depends on your, your student engagement level as I think. And I think it depends on how much faith they have in the system, students have in the system. Because I often think that if, I mean, when I was campaigning this year, quite a few people said, oh, you know, I don't know what the student union is. I don't know what it does. It doesn't do anything for me. And I just think it's a shame because it obviously either I've not been doing my job right or the union haven't been doing our job right. We haven't been communicating properly to show students what we can do or how we can help them or what opportunities we have available to people. And it's just, it is a shame. But I think that, I mean, often people in sports and society don't even know that they're part of the union. They just see themselves as being part of that specific club. Which I can say, it is a shame, but the more that we can interact with our students, sorry, the better our voter turnout will be. So coinciding with this referendum is the by-election as well. Can you just tell us a bit more about that? Yep. We have the by-election going on at the moment. We have two part-time positions available. One of them is the part-time groups officer. So that role is very much related to the groups that we have in the union. So that's the LGBT, mature and postgraduate students group, disabled students group and the international students group. It will also be chair of the groups council as well. So they'd be very much representing on behalf of those students involved in that and any new groups that come along. We do have one candidate running for that as well as Ron, which is reopen nominations. So if people didn't approve, of the other guy, so that's James Wigger, who's running for the position, then they can always vote for reopen nomination. Excuse me. The second position we have available is officer for students. We have three candidates running for that one who are Kayleigh Coddington, Michael Akande and Callum Watt. So this role is very much a general part-time role. So they can kind of adapt any remit that they want to. So they're very much voted on their manifestos. So whatever they seem to be the highlights for them. So it's very, very important before people vote, they do read the manifestos. So the right person gets elected or who they think the right person should be gets elected. Because there's no clear remit for those roles. It's essentially if, I'm just guessing here, if the student has a particular issue or a particular matter that they wish to resolve, they wish to work on, if there's a particular, you know, part of the university that they want to see change in, they can focus on that. And is that vetted at all by the Students' Union, you know, when they put in their application, for example? So if they want to do something absolutely ridiculous, that can still go ahead if they get voted in? Well, yeah, good question. Obviously, if anything was offensive or, you know, not politically correct or anything like that, then the union would step in. But yeah, if a student wants to come in and has an idea that we, I don't know, dig up all of the architecture grass and make it into a big allotment or something, then we wouldn't tell them not to run on that. They can do what they want. It's just they would probably have quite a hard time pushing the agenda once they are elected. And because they'd have to work with the university, obviously. But yeah, we'd happily, we'd have anyone. So anyone can step forward. I'm online this time. Okay. I suppose something else we can cover is the snowflake ball. That is very exciting. So it was only announced very recently that the very talented, very prestigious, very, you know, world-class Tinchy Strider is performing. I'm assuming he's author of students. I don't know him that well, to be honest. But he's no one name, so he must be good. And it's quite a big thing for a big act to come to Lincoln of all places. It is a big act. And actually, we've had a lot of We've had really, really good feedback on the event so far. Obviously, the event's not even happened. But we've had good feedback on Tinchy Strider in particular. We've had good feedback at the fact that we've actually bought it back because 2011, we didn't have a snowflake ball. And we've had great feedback at the fact that we haven't got some tacky tribute artists like last time. I think it was Black Eyed Tees we had last time. So yeah, the feedback's been great. And we obviously sold some early bird tickets. And when I last checked, which was about 3.30pm today, we only had 20 early bird tickets left. So it's selling fast and people are excited. Those early birds have definitely flown the nest. They definitely have. Definitely. And is there a limit or a cap on the general tickets as well? I mean, are they likely to sell out very quickly? From the feedback that I've been getting, I think they will sell quite quickly. But to be honest, there's no telling. If the early birds are anything to go by, then the event could be sold out. But I'm not sure. Time will tell. Time will tell. I'll be going. I will. I've already got my early bird ticket. I'm excited. I didn't want to miss out on that. Just need to get your dress. I've got this beautiful frock planned out. You'll just have to see it. I can't wait. I love it. I'm going for Snow Queen. You should. You should. Definitely. Yeah. Tell the audience a bit more about Snow King and Snow Queen because that wasn't there at the last Snowflake. No, it wasn't. It was just a bit of fun, I think, that was brought up. And we said, you know, we're talking about American proms and that kind of thing. It is very American. It is very American, but it's very cheesy. And actually, when we spoke about it, we were like, actually, that's not a bad idea. Let's go for it. Because, you know, girls like to, you know, make a big effort when they go to something like this. And so do guys. And, you know, it's just nice to do something a bit different. So we're just like, why not? We'll try it. If it works this year, maybe they can do it again next year. And you can nominate anyone for Snow King or Snow... Absolutely anyone. Yep. And what if someone gets nominated, for example, and they haven't actually bought a ticket, they're not actually at the event? Ah, that would be awkward, wouldn't it? I was thinking about that. Because if anyone could be nominated, anyone can get it. And what if they're not actually there? Could be funny. Who knows? That could be funny. Maybe we'll have to go back and talk about that. Because that would be, more than anything, it would be a massive shame to the person who came second place and they were there. So, yeah. Got it. Yeah. Maybe I'll go and talk to Dan about that and see what we can do to work that out. I'm the background man in this operation. I find all the cracks and then you cement them up. Yeah, I'll do cement work. Excellent. And what else is planned? I mean, basically, Snowflake Ball, you dress up in your fineries, your glad rags, have a bit of a boogie to Tinchy Strider. You have your Snow King, Snow Queen. Is there going to be food? Is there going to be party games? Is there going to be Pass the Parcel? Pass the Parcel in the end, you said. That would be huge, wouldn't it? No, there won't be Pass the Parcel. But we are, more than anything, we're spending a lot of money on the decor of the engine shed. So, we're hoping that when people walk into the engine shed, they just won't recognise it. It's going to be a completely different theme, if you like. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give it away. But if people saw the photos from the graduation ball where it was all black and white, better than that. It'll be better than that.
