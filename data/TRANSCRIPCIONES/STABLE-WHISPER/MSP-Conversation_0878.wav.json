{"text": " Okay. Okay. Facebook, Twitter. People still go on MySpace, I'm guessing. Live Journal. We can't talk to each other about anything anymore without a freakout. This whole thing that went down in Virginia. Mm-hmm. Last weekend, the one woman was killed, 19 injured in a protest. And I still, look, I haven't dug too deeply into this because I don't care, to be honest with you. I mean, I don't want to see anyone get killed, obviously. That's terrible. But some nutjobs decide that they're going to protest something several states away. I really don't care. But I guess it was that this was a white supremacist rally. I've heard this repeated over and over and over again. I mean, there appear to have been some white supremacists there. Yes. Because I don't know what any words mean anymore, Tracy. You know, if you talk to some people on the left, anyone to the right of Jane Fonda is alt-right. Kids, ask Jeeves who's Jane Fonda. Michael Moore. Should I have used Michael Moore? Perhaps, yeah. Okay. Anyone to the right of Michael Moore is alt-right. I don't know what alt-right means. I don't think anybody does. I used to know what Nazi meant. Mm-hmm. But, you know, in 2012, there were people on the left who thought Mitt Romney was a Nazi. So I don't even know what a Nazi is anymore. Apparently. The modern definition of Nazi. I have no idea. But apparently there were some folks down there that self-identify as Nazis. I guess so. White supremacists. I don't know. And I think we can all agree, and I can't believe I have to say this, but apparently I have to. I think we can all agree that if you identify yourself as a Nazi or white supremacist, you're a bad person. Mm-hmm. I'll agree with that. So they're getting, they go through the permit process to have this protest about something. I don't know. The Confederate statues. I don't know. Yes, I believe they were taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. Okay. Clearly something to get hot and bothered about. But anyway, that was sarcasm for you people in Ann Arbor. So then they bus in, not the white supremacists. They didn't bus anybody in. Well, they could have come on buses. You don't know this. Yes, that's true. But the Antifa crowd. Mm-hmm. They came to the protest, to counter protest. And for those of you who aren't familiar with Antifa's work, they usually like showing up with clubs. Mm-hmm. Masks. Yes, masks. Balloons. They like to mace people in the face. Right. Balloons filled with urine. Mm-hmm. To throw at their enemies, who apparently their enemies are anyone to the right of Michael Moore. That better? Mm-hmm. So they show up. To peacefully counter protest. Well, they weren't the only group there. You have Black Lives Matter there as well. That's true. Who could be easily labeled a black supremacist. No. Oh, please, Tracy. That's not fair. Oh, I'm sorry. We're not allowed to say the truth? No, you're not allowed to say the truth. I mean, they're not as bad as, say, the new Black Panthers. Excuse me. They are definitely a black supremacist group. So I still don't know what went down, and I don't think a lot of people do. I've seen the footage of the car plowing through the crowd, and it's horrific. And I would thank anyone if what looks like happened, happened, anyone in their right mind would condemn such an action. You just don't get in your car and plow through a group of people. But now, all of a sudden, the media is against politically motivated violence. And I say, welcome. It's about damn time. Where have you people been? Well, they've been cheering while cities burned. Yes. But that's justifiable, Tracy. Of course. People need to vent. I can't tell you how many times in the past eight years of conferences I've attended to rallies I've been to where there has been a threat of left wing violence. Mm hmm. Not a word on CNN about bomb threats at Americans for Prosperity events. In Denver, I had Occupy Wall Street storm our hotel and take over Radio Row. One guy was arrested for spitting in a cop's face. Hmm. Right to work protest up in Michigan. Americans for Prosperity had a tent set up. And people who believe that, you know, if I want a job, I shouldn't have to join a union, filled that tent. And they were surrounded by union goons who repeatedly yelled, we're going to effing kill you. There were women and children in that tent. They ended up cutting that tent down. Stephen Crowder, former Fox News contributor and host of Louder with Crowder, got punched in the face by a union goon. I was told at the time Crowder deserved it for being there and provoking the crowd. My, how attitudes have changed about counter protesting. And if you had it coming. Well, and I also heard very little mention of, I know you were probably remember this because we did discuss this. There were protests in Charlotte in 2016. I believe it was a Black Lives Matter protest. And there was someone murdered there, protester on protester violence, if you will. And then I'm sure everybody remembers the Dallas incident, which was another protest, anti-cop protest, where that nut job opened fire and killed a bunch of officers. But that's OK. It didn't. There was no call. Where is President Obama to rush to the microphone? And then we're going to parse every single word. Because he's abetting this stuff. And this is not to justify what happened at all. No, it's just we should have seen this coming. And I don't think it gets better from here, do you? No, it doesn't get better from here. It gets worse. I want to play you some audio. OK, please do. This is from a story on the USA Today website. ESPN criticized for fantasy football auction. It's not the most popular form of fantasy football, but auction drafts are common. However, ESPN's approach to auctioning players as part of its fantasy sports marathon on Monday night drew criticism from some on social media who said it resembled a slave auction. OK. While white players like New England quarterback Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski were part of the draft, the footage of an auctioneering selling New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. led to some on Twitter to voice their outrage. I want to play you audio from. This is called the sports pulse with Trista Crick. Trista looks like she's about 21 years old. And she's white for you people out there just to let you know, because some people really care about these sort of things.", "segments": [{"start": 0.08, "end": 0.38, "text": " Okay.", "seek": 0.0,

Okay. Facebook, Twitter. People still go on MySpace, I'm guessing. Live Journal. We can't talk to each other about anything anymore without a freakout. This whole thing that went down in Virginia. Mm-hmm. Last weekend, the one woman was killed, 19 injured in a protest. And I still, look, I haven't dug too deeply into this because I don't care, to be honest with you. I mean, I don't want to see anyone get killed, obviously. That's terrible. But some nutjobs decide that they're going to protest something several states away. I really don't care. But I guess it was that this was a white supremacist rally. I've heard this repeated over and over and over again. I mean, there appear to have been some white supremacists there. Yes. Because I don't know what any words mean anymore, Tracy. You know, if you talk to some people on the left, anyone to the right of Jane Fonda is alt-right. Kids, ask Jeeves who's Jane Fonda. Michael Moore. Should I have used Michael Moore? Perhaps, yeah. Okay. Anyone to the right of Michael Moore is alt-right. I don't know what alt-right means. I don't think anybody does. I used to know what Nazi meant. Mm-hmm. But, you know, in 2012, there were people on the left who thought Mitt Romney was a Nazi. So I don't even know what a Nazi is anymore. Apparently. The modern definition of Nazi. I have no idea. But apparently there were some folks down there that self-identify as Nazis. I guess so. White supremacists. I don't know. And I think we can all agree, and I can't believe I have to say this, but apparently I have to. I think we can all agree that if you identify yourself as a Nazi or white supremacist, you're a bad person. Mm-hmm. I'll agree with that. So they're getting, they go through the permit process to have this protest about something. I don't know. The Confederate statues. I don't know. Yes, I believe they were taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. Okay. Clearly something to get hot and bothered about. But anyway, that was sarcasm for you people in Ann Arbor. So then they bus in, not the white supremacists. They didn't bus anybody in. Well, they could have come on buses. You don't know this. Yes, that's true. But the Antifa crowd. Mm-hmm. They came to the protest, to counter protest. And for those of you who aren't familiar with Antifa's work, they usually like showing up with clubs. Mm-hmm. Masks. Yes, masks. Balloons. They like to mace people in the face. Right. Balloons filled with urine. Mm-hmm. To throw at their enemies, who apparently their enemies are anyone to the right of Michael Moore. That better? Mm-hmm. So they show up. To peacefully counter protest. Well, they weren't the only group there. You have Black Lives Matter there as well. That's true. Who could be easily labeled a black supremacist. No. Oh, please, Tracy. That's not fair. Oh, I'm sorry. We're not allowed to say the truth? No, you're not allowed to say the truth. I mean, they're not as bad as, say, the new Black Panthers. Excuse me. They are definitely a black supremacist group. So I still don't know what went down, and I don't think a lot of people do. I've seen the footage of the car plowing through the crowd, and it's horrific. And I would thank anyone if what looks like happened, happened, anyone in their right mind would condemn such an action. You just don't get in your car and plow through a group of people. But now, all of a sudden, the media is against politically motivated violence. And I say, welcome. It's about damn time. Where have you people been? Well, they've been cheering while cities burned. Yes. But that's justifiable, Tracy. Of course. People need to vent. I can't tell you how many times in the past eight years of conferences I've attended to rallies I've been to where there has been a threat of left wing violence. Mm hmm. Not a word on CNN about bomb threats at Americans for Prosperity events. In Denver, I had Occupy Wall Street storm our hotel and take over Radio Row. One guy was arrested for spitting in a cop's face. Hmm. Right to work protest up in Michigan. Americans for Prosperity had a tent set up. And people who believe that, you know, if I want a job, I shouldn't have to join a union, filled that tent. And they were surrounded by union goons who repeatedly yelled, we're going to effing kill you. There were women and children in that tent. They ended up cutting that tent down. Stephen Crowder, former Fox News contributor and host of Louder with Crowder, got punched in the face by a union goon. I was told at the time Crowder deserved it for being there and provoking the crowd. My, how attitudes have changed about counter protesting. And if you had it coming. Well, and I also heard very little mention of, I know you were probably remember this because we did discuss this. There were protests in Charlotte in 2016. I believe it was a Black Lives Matter protest. And there was someone murdered there, protester on protester violence, if you will. And then I'm sure everybody remembers the Dallas incident, which was another protest, anti-cop protest, where that nut job opened fire and killed a bunch of officers. But that's OK. It didn't. There was no call. Where is President Obama to rush to the microphone? And then we're going to parse every single word. Because he's abetting this stuff. And this is not to justify what happened at all. No, it's just we should have seen this coming. And I don't think it gets better from here, do you? No, it doesn't get better from here. It gets worse. I want to play you some audio. OK, please do. This is from a story on the USA Today website. ESPN criticized for fantasy football auction. It's not the most popular form of fantasy football, but auction drafts are common. However, ESPN's approach to auctioning players as part of its fantasy sports marathon on Monday night drew criticism from some on social media who said it resembled a slave auction. OK. While white players like New England quarterback Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski were part of the draft, the footage of an auctioneering selling New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. led to some on Twitter to voice their outrage. I want to play you audio from. This is called the sports pulse with Trista Crick. Trista looks like she's about 21 years old. And she's white for you people out there just to let you know, because some people really care about these sort of things.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.08, "end": 0.38, "text": " Okay.",
