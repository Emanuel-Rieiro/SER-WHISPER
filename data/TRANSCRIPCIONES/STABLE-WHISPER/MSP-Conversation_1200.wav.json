{"text": " We had forgotten completely that he whistles from the moment he gets up until he goes to sleep. Oh, so people were disturbed by that. They were very disturbed. One guy said, I'm going to stuff a rag in his mouth. Another guy said, I won't get anywhere near that guy. And actually, I saw a group of women ganging up on him. I thought they were going to, like, be violent with him to make him stop whistling. And the people in the facility said he has to go upstairs to the Alzheimer's unit. So we took him up there where people are much further along than he is. And he declined quite quickly. He didn't want to eat. He didn't want to walk anymore. When I would go get him to take him somewhere, I had to put him in a wheelchair. He refused to go anywhere. He seemed frightened of the outside world. I was told by people that he didn't know how to do anything. And then I knew things were bad when I called him the day before Father's Day. And I said, Dad, I'm coming to see you. And I would call him and harmonize on the phone the whole time we were away. If I didn't go see him every day, the days I wasn't there with him, I sang with him and harmonized with him on the phone. He refused to sing with me. You knew something was wrong. We knew something was very wrong. And my older sister went and got him and kidnapped him and brought him home. And within two hours, he was smiling and singing. I just think he needed to be back home. Three days later, he went and played tennis with his grandsons. And he's playing Frisbee. He's gained 12 pounds. He's been singing with us all this summer. And he had a really, really good summer. The last week, not so good. But we brought him home. We got another summer with my father. And I'm so glad we did that. You know, it's such a lesson that, you know, when you have the experience of being a caregiver, you do try different ways to provide the best care you can. But some of them don't work. And you have to be able to say, okay, this was a mistake. I'm going to move on from here. So it sounds like you've made that transition pretty well. It was hard to do that. And again, my mother, you know, here I am. I'm talking on the phone right now with you. So my mother is alone downstairs with my father. And I know that's very difficult. And when I go away, she is trapped with him. I mean, I hate to put it like that. But we do have someone in the house helping. But I think what I just told you about is that proof that, you know, the family's love, it means so much. And that you also have this sense that no one else can do it as well as you can. However, that is a trap at the same time. I know that at some point, we're going to have to say we can't do this anymore. But there's nothing like family love. And if there's any way you can do this with your loved one, you know, I'd really recommend it. Problem is, most people cannot take a huge risk the way I did. How's your father doing now? And how's your mom? I think we're sort of in that stasis, this in-between stage. We had a great summer where the whole family was here helping. You know, we had brothers-in-laws and grandchildren and my sisters were here. They're all gone. They just all went back to school and jobs. And, you know, we, I'm sorry, there's a call waiting, beeping noise, forgive me. I think we're wondering what to do next. And we just don't know. So we're looking at the possibility of bringing someone in the home more often to start off with. And then we're looking at places where he could go full-time to live near our place in northern Michigan. Well, you know, I'm going to mention to you when we talked the first time that I just learned about, this summer I just learned about like group homes for Alzheimer's patients. And we actually moved my mom from a larger assisted facility to a group home where there are only several other people and a caregiver. And it's worked out just a lot better for her. So, you know, I'll throw that out there. That is, to me, after what we saw, I mean, you have a situation where you're touring 62 people at the same time or something in the morning. That's when bad things happen. And I think that a situation of like 10 to 12 people, something like that would be good. And there's also a very good forward-thinking progressivity up here that is involved with the Eden Method and the Montessori Method. And I'm excited about these things. There is a change right now. Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about the different methods of caring for Alzheimer's that you're seeing or maybe actually creating because we talked our first conversation about music therapy and how you've seen that become really a lifeline between your dad and the rest of the world. Can you tell us more about that? Music has been the thing that really sustains us and is the thread, is the link of communication between my father and us and perhaps the rest of the world. He just performed with his 12-man singing group called LeBrunton last April. He sang with the U of M Glee Club Friars group just a month ago up here in northern Michigan. When he gets on the stage, he becomes the person he was before Alzheimer's. It's an incredible thing to watch. We all sang together as an a cappella group, my family, my sisters and I, so my older sister, my younger sister, Libby and Allison, my mother, my father and I, and we sang around the Detroit area. And I think my father attached his identity to the singing more than the musician in him, more than anything he did. He was president of E&E Engineering, an industrial distribution firm in Detroit. But I think he took the most pride in his identity as a musician. And so that's just stayed with him. And even when everything else falls away, he still knows the words to all the songs he's ever sung, almost all of them. Isn't that great? And so that's how we talk to each other. And in the morning when I know he's really groggy, it's almost like as if he doesn't have any batteries. When I sing the small hours of the morning, his favorite Frank Sinatra tune, he opens his eyes, he starts harmonizing, perfect baritone part. But I also really believe I see him connect with me. And often we'll say the lyrics of songs to each other, and that to him is conversation. And I really wish people knew the power of music. I know it can't work for everyone, but I've been told that even people who are tone deaf, if they have a song in their lives that means something to them, if they're in a state as an elderly person or someone with Alzheimer's, and you even think they're catatonic, and you think there's nothing going on anymore. If you bring their favorite song to the table in some way, they're singing it or playing a CD, it can actually open new channels into the brain. I've gotten reports and interviewed people for the book, people who thought they couldn't talk anymore. And they would sing their favorite song, and they would come alive, start mouthing the words, and actually use music as a way to get that person to speak again. I understand the power of music. I know that it makes a huge difference with people like my father. And that's why I consulted with Dr. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist who wrote the book Awakenings that was made into a movie with Robert Williams. Right, right, with Robin Williams. Yeah, and he really has been exploring this and just wrote a book, Musicophilia, about the power of music. And he interviewed my dad for a part of his book. And then I used our interview and went to go see him in New York City. I used that in the book, too, to try to explain about the power of music. But even though Dr. Sacks has done volumes and volumes of research and interviewed hundreds of people, we still can't give a clear answer as to why music can have such power and influence and actually open channels in the brain of people with neurological diseases. Well, you know, I saw the same thing with my mom in assisted living is when they would have kind of a music singing circle, and they would each have their little notebooks of different songs, and they were songs from the 20s and the 30s. And I'll tell you, it was amazing because people who I never even saw speak, and all the times we would visit my mom, we saw people singing songs, and I saw my mom singing songs that I didn't even know she knew, and she didn't even have to look at the words. It is amazing. It opens them up. Yeah, it really does. And I wish that music was used more in facilities because I think it makes such a difference. It can also calm people. It can comfort them. And I would like to actually help to try to bring more music into facilities like the one my father has been in, and also just thinking of ways you could bring physical therapy and music therapy perhaps into the home, perhaps four hours of talk therapy, music therapy, and physical therapy that you could actually bring into someone's home on a regular basis or bring to nursing homes on a regular basis. Well, maybe there's a recording that's coming after the book. What do you think? You never know. Well, you know, one of the things that made me really smile in the book was when you talked about making Alzheimer's chicken with your dad. What was Alzheimer's chicken, and why does it have such meaning to you and Woody? Well, I think, just as we talked about with the music, I think you forget. Sometimes you become so depressed also, and it's kind of in-your-face grief that this person can't talk with you, but you forget. To me, I mean, one of the lessons that I learned from coming home was there's always a way to communicate, whether it's just holding my father's hand or looking into his eyes and singing his song. But there are days you're just sitting there, and you're down in the dumps, and you feel he can't do anything in the house anymore. I mean, when I came home, he could do vacuuming. He could do folding. We did certain things together, like make the beds. He could still do that kind of, but not very much. But I think you stop asking the person to help you because it's so tedious saying, okay, you do it like this, you do it like this. Well, then I realized that one of the reasons you start axing that person from your daily routines and the things you used to do together is because they don't do them the way you do them. So I said, you know what? We have to change our standards. So I often had him come help me hang up my clothes in my closet, and they're all hung up upside down and wrinkly. But they love to do laundry. Alzheimer's patients love laundry. In every facility I go to, there's laundry folding. Yeah, exactly. I wrote in the book about how it's like watching some sort of tragic, strange dance. They move together. They fold together. That laundry folding thing is familiar. But my father used to help us in the kitchen chop vegetables, and we stopped doing it for a while. And then I said, wait a minute. We only had him stop doing it because they were all uneven, and it didn't look good. Well, who cares what it looks like? Who cares? So I said, come on, Dad. And he could still chop, even though he's had Alzheimer's. I mean, this is not recommended for everyone because it can be dangerous. But I gave him sort of a dull knife, and he could chop carrots. And they're all different sizes. So he cut up carrots, celery. Help me chop the herbs. I just put them all down. And we make this chicken together that you pour red wine over. That always helps. And some olive oil. And we put some lemon juice on it. And we put it in there, and he helps make it. Now, the vegetables are all uneven. But who cares? And you put this thing together. And he knows somehow, I believe, he really knew when the last time we did this that he was helping me make this dinner for everyone. And it made him feel useful in the house. And, of course, then we sang while we're chopping up the vegetables all uneven. And I didn't tell him, don't do it that way. Or try to make the celery be all even. You know, you just let it be. Let it be. Let it be. So now it's his brand of Alzheimer's chicken, I call it. And we make the chicken together, and it fills the house with a wonderful aroma and the recipes in the book. And it's just an example of how I think everyone can think of ways to include someone with Alzheimer's in their lives. But you have to change your standards, and that's okay. They really do want to be helpful. We see that in my mom. We have her, you know, over and, you know, for like a family dinner or something. And she wants to come and cook in the kitchen. And in the past, we've said, oh, mom, you don't have to do that anymore. We do it for you. But, you know, I didn't really connect with it until I read that chapter about Alzheimer's chicken. And she really gets a kick out of setting the table. So now we're letting her do those things. Right. Maybe the silverware won't be in the right place, but that's okay. Who cares? We're all sitting there together. Who cares? That's the main thing. Well, tell me, how does the caregiving experience allow you time and space to think about what's next for you? And you just mentioned a little while ago that you were really wondering, you know, you kind of have to keep that portal open so that you don't become lost in the Alzheimer's experience. So, you know, what is next for you, Mary Ellen? I don't know. I don't. But I don't. I'm being really honest with you. I think we are seeing a new phase in my father. And there is quite a bit of decline in the last couple weeks since everyone left. I think what's interesting about this time is that the book has actually ended up being, I think, a gift in so many ways. And one of those gifts is I bring my mother and father with me to book signings. Oh, that's so great. And I said, Dad, can you sing with me? And people loved hearing him. And he's wonderful. He harmonizes, you know, so well. And he remembers all his songs. And it was actually really, I think, good for him and good for my mother. So I'm incorporating my mother and father into this time in my life. And that way, my mother also doesn't get left alone taking care of my dad. Sure. That's all. And that's so fascinating. It really is because he is an incredible, incredible case. And now he's doing something new, too. When he doesn't know the words to songs or he's never heard a song before and he hears it on the radio, he makes up words and they rhyme. So he's made up a kind of Alzheimer's rap that he's doing right now. It's very interesting. You should record that and have Woody's songs sung by him. Instead of recording, you know, a police chief or somebody at the scene of a fire, I'm recording my father singing. But I really would like to be involved more in helping to improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients. I continue to write. You know, the big dilemma is, you know, how you take care of yourself. And so between the book tour and taking care of dad, it can be a little hectic. And so my mother and I are going to try to enter into some sort of regular plan with either a caregiver in the house or an institution. But I think you're bringing up something very important, which is, you know, caregivers forget about themselves. They do. And that's one of the things that I talk about in the book that I think is so important. It's just you have to, even if you don't want to, like you get so almost addicted to your role as caregiver and you don't want to leave. And you have to get away to breathe, even if it's in the other room. You know, even to go take a bath. I really recommend exercising. That is one of the best things you can possibly do. But force yourself to go away, even if it's for an hour. And some places, a lot of people say they can't leave because it costs money. The Area Agency on Aging, which is in every county, I believe, in the United States, often has respite care for as little as $5 for just four hours. They come in once a week. They'll check the patient's blood pressure, other things, and just be with them for four hours so you can get away. And there are many things like this that people, I think, don't realize that you can tap into so you can break the pattern, the everyday depressing pattern of your life, the repetition, the taking care of daily tasks and daily living for that person. You have to get away and think about yourself. And, you know, you raise an important point. You raise an important point about caregivers taking care of themselves because for our generation of baby boomers, there are going to be so many of us that are going to be providing caregiving as, you know, many, many, many millions of people move into, you know, the realm of Alzheimer's and dementia and other, you know, illnesses of aging. So, you know, we've got to have a game plan. I don't think we have one. One in eight baby boomers are going to get Alzheimer's disease. It's considered the sixth leading cause of death right now in the United States. 5.1 million people have it right now, but they say by 2050, the Alzheimer's Association predicts there'll be about 16 million people with Alzheimer's disease. And we have to make a plan because what I see, the paradigm of the institutions, it doesn't work for me. And I think we've got to start thinking about what we are going to do, what's going to be right for us. We've got to take care of ourselves as well. And I do think that's so important. And, hey, getting exercise now. And also some of the music therapists I talk with said iPods are great because for all of us, when we get older, we're going to have our tune list with us. With us. Bring us back into the world, record it on our iPod. This is great. I've got my list already. You know, I think we tend to think, or at least up until now, we've tended to think of Alzheimer's as, you know, a disease of those people who are much older than us. My best friend, who is my age, 57, was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's two years ago. And so, you know, I just talked with her this morning. She's losing some speech already. She was in news reporting like you. And so it's really, you know, something that we can't defer as, you know, an issue of old age. It's like right up front and center for us right now. So what, I know we're getting close to the end of our time together, but if there were, you know, two or three things that you've learned through this experience of caring for your dad that you could pass on as advice to the rest of us, what would those things be? You know, I found this quote recently from Mother Teresa that I really love. And I wish I'd had it before I read the book, before I came home, actually. I wish I'd had it. But it goes like this. If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten we belong to each other. And since I came home, I think one of the biggest things I've learned is that I belong to my parents and they belong to me. And I think it's so, so many of my friends don't realize, I think we forget, you know, how much we belong to each other. And once you sort of surrender that and you say, hey, I'm responsible, I belong, this really has expanded my heart. And it's helped me belong to the world, I think, in a whole new way. And I also believe doing this weird thing I've done, which nobody, you know, they used to call me danger girl. I mean, to be on breaking stories. That was my whole life. And I believe taking this huge leap of faith, which I had no plan. I had no idea what I was going to do when I came home. I really think that this act of kindness inspires others. It's like this pebble, you know, in a calm lake and you drop the pebble in and the rings go out and out and continue and influence others. And I really think that I'm amazed at the kindness of so many people that I've met along the way on this strange journey I've gone on. I think the second thing I've learned is how my mother's and father's love is. I really admire them. And I would like to have a love like that sometime. And the third thing, it's a gift to take care of someone else. I had no idea I would feel that way, but I really do. I really have found out who I am. I think you find out who you are when you do something like this. And also, you find out who you are when you slow down and you allow yourself to slow down. I mean, my life goes really slowly now compared to my other life. But you really have found yourself. I really feel that I have.

completely that he whistles from the moment he gets up until he goes to sleep. Oh, so people were disturbed by that. They were very disturbed. One guy said, I'm going to stuff a rag in his mouth. Another guy said, I won't get anywhere near that guy. And actually, I saw a group of women ganging up on him. I thought they were going to, like, be violent with him to make him stop whistling. And the people in the facility said he has to go upstairs to the Alzheimer's unit. So we took him up there where people are much further along than he is. And he declined quite quickly. He didn't want to eat. He didn't want to walk anymore. When I would go get him to take him somewhere, I had to put him in a wheelchair. He refused to go anywhere. He seemed frightened of the outside world. I was told by people that he didn't know how to do anything. And then I knew things were bad when I called him the day before Father's Day. And I said, Dad, I'm coming to see you. And I would call him and harmonize on the phone the whole time we were away. If I didn't go see him every day, the days I wasn't there with him, I sang with him and harmonized with him on the phone. He refused to sing with me. You knew something was wrong. We knew something was very wrong. And my older sister went and got him and kidnapped him and brought him home. And within two hours, he was smiling and singing. I just think he needed to be back home. Three days later, he went and played tennis with his grandsons. And he's playing Frisbee. He's gained 12 pounds. He's been singing with us all this summer. And he had a really, really good summer. The last week, not so good. But we brought him home. We got another summer with my father. And I'm so glad we did that. You know, it's such a lesson that, you know, when you have the experience of being a caregiver, you do try different ways to provide the best care you can. But some of them don't work. And you have to be able to say, okay, this was a mistake. I'm going to move on from here. So it sounds like you've made that transition pretty well. It was hard to do that. And again, my mother, you know, here I am. I'm talking on the phone right now with you. So my mother is alone downstairs with my father. And I know that's very difficult. And when I go away, she is trapped with him. I mean, I hate to put it like that. But we do have someone in the house helping. But I think what I just told you about is that proof that, you know, the family's love, it means so much. And that you also have this sense that no one else can do it as well as you can. However, that is a trap at the same time. I know that at some point, we're going to have to say we can't do this anymore. But there's nothing like family love. And if there's any way you can do this with your loved one, you know, I'd really recommend it. Problem is, most people cannot take a huge risk the way I did. How's your father doing now? And how's your mom? I think we're sort of in that stasis, this in-between stage. We had a great summer where the whole family was here helping. You know, we had brothers-in-laws and grandchildren and my sisters were here. They're all gone. They just all went back to school and jobs. And, you know, we, I'm sorry, there's a call waiting, beeping noise, forgive me. I think we're wondering what to do next. And we just don't know. So we're looking at the possibility of bringing someone in the home more often to start off with. And then we're looking at places where he could go full-time to live near our place in northern Michigan. Well, you know, I'm going to mention to you when we talked the first time that I just learned about, this summer I just learned about like group homes for Alzheimer's patients. And we actually moved my mom from a larger assisted facility to a group home where there are only several other people and a caregiver. And it's worked out just a lot better for her. So, you know, I'll throw that out there. That is, to me, after what we saw, I mean, you have a situation where you're touring 62 people at the same time or something in the morning. That's when bad things happen. And I think that a situation of like 10 to 12 people, something like that would be good. And there's also a very good forward-thinking progressivity up here that is involved with the Eden Method and the Montessori Method. And I'm excited about these things. There is a change right now. Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about the different methods of caring for Alzheimer's that you're seeing or maybe actually creating because we talked our first conversation about music therapy and how you've seen that become really a lifeline between your dad and the rest of the world. Can you tell us more about that? Music has been the thing that really sustains us and is the thread, is the link of communication between my father and us and perhaps the rest of the world. He just performed with his 12-man singing group called LeBrunton last April. He sang with the U of M Glee Club Friars group just a month ago up here in northern Michigan. When he gets on the stage, he becomes the person he was before Alzheimer's. It's an incredible thing to watch. We all sang together as an a cappella group, my family, my sisters and I, so my older sister, my younger sister, Libby and Allison, my mother, my father and I, and we sang around the Detroit area. And I think my father attached his identity to the singing more than the musician in him, more than anything he did. He was president of E&E Engineering, an industrial distribution firm in Detroit. But I think he took the most pride in his identity as a musician. And so that's just stayed with him. And even when everything else falls away, he still knows the words to all the songs he's ever sung, almost all of them. Isn't that great? And so that's how we talk to each other. And in the morning when I know he's really groggy, it's almost like as if he doesn't have any batteries. When I sing the small hours of the morning, his favorite Frank Sinatra tune, he opens his eyes, he starts harmonizing, perfect baritone part. But I also really believe I see him connect with me. And often we'll say the lyrics of songs to each other, and that to him is conversation. And I really wish people knew the power of music. I know it can't work for everyone, but I've been told that even people who are tone deaf, if they have a song in their lives that means something to them, if they're in a state as an elderly person or someone with Alzheimer's, and you even think they're catatonic, and you think there's nothing going on anymore. If you bring their favorite song to the table in some way, they're singing it or playing a CD, it can actually open new channels into the brain. I've gotten reports and interviewed people for the book, people who thought they couldn't talk anymore. And they would sing their favorite song, and they would come alive, start mouthing the words, and actually use music as a way to get that person to speak again. I understand the power of music. I know that it makes a huge difference with people like my father. And that's why I consulted with Dr. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist who wrote the book Awakenings that was made into a movie with Robert Williams. Right, right, with Robin Williams. Yeah, and he really has been exploring this and just wrote a book, Musicophilia, about the power of music. And he interviewed my dad for a part of his book. And then I used our interview and went to go see him in New York City. I used that in the book, too, to try to explain about the power of music. But even though Dr. Sacks has done volumes and volumes of research and interviewed hundreds of people, we still can't give a clear answer as to why music can have such power and influence and actually open channels in the brain of people with neurological diseases. Well, you know, I saw the same thing with my mom in assisted living is when they would have kind of a music singing circle, and they would each have their little notebooks of different songs, and they were songs from the 20s and the 30s. And I'll tell you, it was amazing because people who I never even saw speak, and all the times we would visit my mom, we saw people singing songs, and I saw my mom singing songs that I didn't even know she knew, and she didn't even have to look at the words. It is amazing. It opens them up. Yeah, it really does. And I wish that music was used more in facilities because I think it makes such a difference. It can also calm people. It can comfort them. And I would like to actually help to try to bring more music into facilities like the one my father has been in, and also just thinking of ways you could bring physical therapy and music therapy perhaps into the home, perhaps four hours of talk therapy, music therapy, and physical therapy that you could actually bring into someone's home on a regular basis or bring to nursing homes on a regular basis. Well, maybe there's a recording that's coming after the book. What do you think? You never know. Well, you know, one of the things that made me really smile in the book was when you talked about making Alzheimer's chicken with your dad. What was Alzheimer's chicken, and why does it have such meaning to you and Woody? Well, I think, just as we talked about with the music, I think you forget. Sometimes you become so depressed also, and it's kind of in-your-face grief that this person can't talk with you, but you forget. To me, I mean, one of the lessons that I learned from coming home was there's always a way to communicate, whether it's just holding my father's hand or looking into his eyes and singing his song. But there are days you're just sitting there, and you're down in the dumps, and you feel he can't do anything in the house anymore. I mean, when I came home, he could do vacuuming. He could do folding. We did certain things together, like make the beds. He could still do that kind of, but not very much. But I think you stop asking the person to help you because it's so tedious saying, okay, you do it like this, you do it like this. Well, then I realized that one of the reasons you start axing that person from your daily routines and the things you used to do together is because they don't do them the way you do them. So I said, you know what? We have to change our standards. So I often had him come help me hang up my clothes in my closet, and they're all hung up upside down and wrinkly. But they love to do laundry. Alzheimer's patients love laundry. In every facility I go to, there's laundry folding. Yeah, exactly. I wrote in the book about how it's like watching some sort of tragic, strange dance. They move together. They fold together. That laundry folding thing is familiar. But my father used to help us in the kitchen chop vegetables, and we stopped doing it for a while. And then I said, wait a minute. We only had him stop doing it because they were all uneven, and it didn't look good. Well, who cares what it looks like? Who cares? So I said, come on, Dad. And he could still chop, even though he's had Alzheimer's. I mean, this is not recommended for everyone because it can be dangerous. But I gave him sort of a dull knife, and he could chop carrots. And they're all different sizes. So he cut up carrots, celery. Help me chop the herbs. I just put them all down. And we make this chicken together that you pour red wine over. That always helps. And some olive oil. And we put some lemon juice on it. And we put it in there, and he helps make it. Now, the vegetables are all uneven. But who cares? And you put this thing together. And he knows somehow, I believe, he really knew when the last time we did this that he was helping me make this dinner for everyone. And it made him feel useful in the house. And, of course, then we sang while we're chopping up the vegetables all uneven. And I didn't tell him, don't do it that way. Or try to make the celery be all even. You know, you just let it be. Let it be. Let it be. So now it's his brand of Alzheimer's chicken, I call it. And we make the chicken together, and it fills the house with a wonderful aroma and the recipes in the book. And it's just an example of how I think everyone can think of ways to include someone with Alzheimer's in their lives. But you have to change your standards, and that's okay. They really do want to be helpful. We see that in my mom. We have her, you know, over and, you know, for like a family dinner or something. And she wants to come and cook in the kitchen. And in the past, we've said, oh, mom, you don't have to do that anymore. We do it for you. But, you know, I didn't really connect with it until I read that chapter about Alzheimer's chicken. And she really gets a kick out of setting the table. So now we're letting her do those things. Right. Maybe the silverware won't be in the right place, but that's okay. Who cares? We're all sitting there together. Who cares? That's the main thing. Well, tell me, how does the caregiving experience allow you time and space to think about what's next for you? And you just mentioned a little while ago that you were really wondering, you know, you kind of have to keep that portal open so that you don't become lost in the Alzheimer's experience. So, you know, what is next for you, Mary Ellen? I don't know. I don't. But I don't. I'm being really honest with you. I think we are seeing a new phase in my father. And there is quite a bit of decline in the last couple weeks since everyone left. I think what's interesting about this time is that the book has actually ended up being, I think, a gift in so many ways. And one of those gifts is I bring my mother and father with me to book signings. Oh, that's so great. And I said, Dad, can you sing with me? And people loved hearing him. And he's wonderful. He harmonizes, you know, so well. And he remembers all his songs. And it was actually really, I think, good for him and good for my mother. So I'm incorporating my mother and father into this time in my life. And that way, my mother also doesn't get left alone taking care of my dad. Sure. That's all. And that's so fascinating. It really is because he is an incredible, incredible case. And now he's doing something new, too. When he doesn't know the words to songs or he's never heard a song before and he hears it on the radio, he makes up words and they rhyme. So he's made up a kind of Alzheimer's rap that he's doing right now. It's very interesting. You should record that and have Woody's songs sung by him. Instead of recording, you know, a police chief or somebody at the scene of a fire, I'm recording my father singing. But I really would like to be involved more in helping to improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients. I continue to write. You know, the big dilemma is, you know, how you take care of yourself. And so between the book tour and taking care of dad, it can be a little hectic. And so my mother and I are going to try to enter into some sort of regular plan with either a caregiver in the house or an institution. But I think you're bringing up something very important, which is, you know, caregivers forget about themselves. They do. And that's one of the things that I talk about in the book that I think is so important. It's just you have to, even if you don't want to, like you get so almost addicted to your role as caregiver and you don't want to leave. And you have to get away to breathe, even if it's in the other room. You know, even to go take a bath. I really recommend exercising. That is one of the best things you can possibly do. But force yourself to go away, even if it's for an hour. And some places, a lot of people say they can't leave because it costs money. The Area Agency on Aging, which is in every county, I believe, in the United States, often has respite care for as little as $5 for just four hours. They come in once a week. They'll check the patient's blood pressure, other things, and just be with them for four hours so you can get away. And there are many things like this that people, I think, don't realize that you can tap into so you can break the pattern, the everyday depressing pattern of your life, the repetition, the taking care of daily tasks and daily living for that person. You have to get away and think about yourself. And, you know, you raise an important point. You raise an important point about caregivers taking care of themselves because for our generation of baby boomers, there are going to be so many of us that are going to be providing caregiving as, you know, many, many, many millions of people move into, you know, the realm of Alzheimer's and dementia and other, you know, illnesses of aging. So, you know, we've got to have a game plan. I don't think we have one. One in eight baby boomers are going to get Alzheimer's disease. It's considered the sixth leading cause of death right now in the United States. 5.1 million people have it right now, but they say by 2050, the Alzheimer's Association predicts there'll be about 16 million people with Alzheimer's disease. And we have to make a plan because what I see, the paradigm of the institutions, it doesn't work for me. And I think we've got to start thinking about what we are going to do, what's going to be right for us. We've got to take care of ourselves as well. And I do think that's so important. And, hey, getting exercise now. And also some of the music therapists I talk with said iPods are great because for all of us, when we get older, we're going to have our tune list with us. With us. Bring us back into the world, record it on our iPod. This is great. I've got my list already. You know, I think we tend to think, or at least up until now, we've tended to think of Alzheimer's as, you know, a disease of those people who are much older than us. My best friend, who is my age, 57, was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's two years ago. And so, you know, I just talked with her this morning. She's losing some speech already. She was in news reporting like you. And so it's really, you know, something that we can't defer as, you know, an issue of old age. It's like right up front and center for us right now. So what, I know we're getting close to the end of our time together, but if there were, you know, two or three things that you've learned through this experience of caring for your dad that you could pass on as advice to the rest of us, what would those things be? You know, I found this quote recently from Mother Teresa that I really love. And I wish I'd had it before I read the book, before I came home, actually. I wish I'd had it. But it goes like this. If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten we belong to each other. And since I came home, I think one of the biggest things I've learned is that I belong to my parents and they belong to me. And I think it's so, so many of my friends don't realize, I think we forget, you know, how much we belong to each other. And once you sort of surrender that and you say, hey, I'm responsible, I belong, this really has expanded my heart. And it's helped me belong to the world, I think, in a whole new way. And I also believe doing this weird thing I've done, which nobody, you know, they used to call me danger girl. I mean, to be on breaking stories. That was my whole life. And I believe taking this huge leap of faith, which I had no plan. I had no idea what I was going to do when I came home. I really think that this act of kindness inspires others. It's like this pebble, you know, in a calm lake and you drop the pebble in and the rings go out and out and continue and influence others. And I really think that I'm amazed at the kindness of so many people that I've met along the way on this strange journey I've gone on. I think the second thing I've learned is how my mother's and father's love is. I really admire them. And I would like to have a love like that sometime. And the third thing, it's a gift to take care of someone else. I had no idea I would feel that way, but I really do. I really have found out who I am. I think you find out who you are when you do something like this. And also, you find out who you are when you slow down and you allow yourself to slow down. I mean, my life goes really slowly now compared to my other life. But you really have found yourself. I really feel that I have.
