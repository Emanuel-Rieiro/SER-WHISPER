{"text": " She reminds me of Red Simons on Red Faces. It's on Hey Hey It's Saturday with the big gong. Gong. Gong, time off. But she is so much, she is so, so much better looking. That's true. And probably subtle, the person who's speaking, because some of the people that we've spoken to, you know, suddenly sit down and you can tell. They feel that they're going to be there for ten minutes. You know, it's their moment of fame. They just get this quiet tap on the back to say, go, move on. But I must say, I really enjoyed, I mean, all our guests have been great, you know, and thanks to them all. But I think, you know, for me, Fred Luddy was a bit of a coup, because we were invited to talk to Fred. We didn't approach ServiceNow or Fred. And Rob and I made a particular point not to talk about the company as much as we could, but to talk about the man and his journey. And I think he was, you know, some of the things he said were pretty inspirational. And I love the picture that Tristan used for the podcast about someone rolling the sleeves up. And that's exactly what he did. You know, he said he still programs, he still gets his hands dirty. I was going to use a photo of a toilet, because as I said, I love that analogy. But I thought, you know, it's not quite appropriate. So we'll make that one. No. Chris might have. You know, I was thinking just the other day about favourite podcasts. Thinking about not just our podcast, but podcasts in general. And realised that there's only one podcast in the world where I make a point of getting, listening to every single episode. Can you guess what it is? The Bugle. No. Practitioner Radio. Yeah. Chris and Troy de Moulin. Yeah. Absolutely. I went right back through. I didn't start listening until they're up to about 17 or 18. And I went right back through the back catalogue as well. As religiously catching up with every new one that comes out. That's just awesome. That really is. Yeah. I'm a little bit behind at the moment, but I'm starting to walk in the evenings again. So I'll catch up. Me too. Must listen to more. Yeah. So I'll put a link in the show notes to that one, as well as the TF T12 and all the things that we've mentioned. We've had a couple of issues again with the technology and we've lost Kaz, but we're going to carry on and finish this off without her. But she's here with us in spirit, obviously. So we sort of discussed the favourite podcasts of the year. I've enjoyed every one I've been on. And we're certainly looking forward to bringing more to you next year. And I think I've got two or three ideas out of the discussion tonight of what we can do. So that's probably a good segue into the next thing we were going to talk about, which is predictions for 2013. I haven't done my homework, so I don't actually have. I haven't had time to think about really predictions for 2013. I'm kind of thinking day to day at the moment. More than anything. So I'm going to throw this open to you, Simone and Rob, and see what you... I'm sure that, Rob, you've been talking to the Swami. Well, yeah, I hitchhiked down to the West Coast and found him living on a commune up the back of Hokitika. So after I sobered him up a bit and had a wee chat to him, I got a few coherent things out of the IT Swami. He said that bring your own device will, of course, be even more mainstream next year. And that's something we're really going to have to cope with. And I think my views on that are well documented in the blog in terms of, you know, it's an organisational decision that needs to be escalated to the correct levels to make it one way or another. And then either IT needs to shut up and enable it or users have to shut up and get on with their jobs, depending on which way the decision goes. But that's going to be real hardcore this year. I reckon it's going to get even more of an issue than it was. And of course, BYOD, Android's going to win. Uh-huh. OK. There's more Android devices shipping than Apple devices by about two or three to one now. Isn't it interesting that Apple are now becoming what Microsoft used to be? I'm more interested in the BYO KFC. Bring your own McNuggets? Yeah, exactly. Or some spicy wings. In fact, I might have to go for a wander after this next year. Now I've got KFC on my head. Yeah, yes. You have to add the bacon and cheese, remember. Exactly. But if you walk there, it's healthy. Ah, right. OK. I think, Tristan, that your prediction for 2013 is that you're going to have a more balanced life, isn't it? I'm certainly going to. Well, I don't know. I think there is balance because I've just, one of my mates and I have decided we're going to do a beer challenge next year and we're going to do 365 beers in 365 days. It's different New Zealand craft beers. So to balance that out, I'm thinking I should also run a 5K or a 10K run at some stage. Every day. While you listen to practitioner radio. Exactly. But I know if something, you know, with my prediction before of something, you know, something has to always give, I know of those two, which is going to give. Well, I usually don't like to do too many predictions because it's like hedging your bets a bit, isn't it? It's like, do I really put that money down on the nose on that horse? I actually normally put it down on its feet. I mean, I'm usually pretty good at that sort of things. But, you know, it's pretty hard to tell with the fillies out in this field for ITSM next year. What I'd like to see is service catalogue issues, resolved positively. Like, you know, I'd like people to just sort of get over all this complexity and, you know, really focus on the simplicity of what the whole reason it's there for, which is communication. Amen, sister. Jesus, have I been fighting that good fight or what the last few months? I'm just about over it, I tell you. I now have a prediction. Yeah? That won't happen. Oh, thanks. What, just because I said it? No, just because how many years beating our heads against brick walls? I'm far too cynical tonight. Well, this is the other thing where I think that it's really going to help it. I think the other thing I'm seeing now happening, and I think it's really going to, I'd like to see it take a real hold within support, which is the social media channels and communities being used the right way. But the thing is, is that they haven't truly adopted it anyway at this point. So I'd really like to see that come into service, if you like. You know, a lot of the organisations are already using it. So I'd really like to see support actually, you know, participating and using these channels to their advantage and to the advantage of the people they're there to support. As another channel to service desks or to support, yeah. Well, yes. I mean, there are some, some of those channels can work quite well. And I think the other thing is, though, is again, back to skill sets, is that each of those channels does have a different type of writing style or focus or need. You know, I mean, 140 characters is not a lot to be effusively polite. So, you know, understanding how to write that versus a Google community or a Facebook community, you know, there's different ways of doing it. I would love to see somebody being actually honest about their service catalogue and say, we do stuff, we have no idea what it is, and we'll make it up as we go along because we haven't actually documented any of it. And just see how that actually goes down with the business. Well, you know, I've got plans for your conference next year, Tristan. So we'll see how that pans out. It's one of those bugbears for me. And I just really want people to sit back and stop getting caught up in the whirlwind of it and communicate. That's what it's there for. You know who's not going to help is the vendors because now that CMDB's been... What's that? What's CMDB? Yeah, exactly. Now that CMDB is a deceased equine. Wow. In sensible circles. That's what the D stands for, isn't it? Yeah, that's right. It's a CMB deceased. Yeah, that's right. Now they can no longer flog that horse. The vendors have all moved on to automated provisioning and request catalogues. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with that. Again, as long as it's actually the hinge point is put the right way. Yeah, but so now we're over-hyping those as the solution to all the social ills and we're telling everybody that that is the service catalogue when, of course, that's bollocks. It's not. Ah, magic button, silver bullet stuff again. Yeah, exactly. So I don't think that'll get any better next year. I expect to be involved in a number of more stouches around service catalogue next year. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to be... I think it's going to become a little bit more normal. I think people are going to finally start getting it. I'd really like to see that happen. And I think the social media channels in these communities, etc, might actually make a difference that way. Well, there's two social media issues, right? There's using it in support as a tool. Yes. And there's social media as the communication tool. amongst us service management philosophers, right? So I'm all for service desks and service operatives using it as a channel. In terms of our community, I coined England's law earlier this year, which is that all social media channels degenerate into a babble. Yeah, and you know what? You do see that happen. Something new will start and everybody gets into it and it's all good because this is... LinkedIn grew. Yeah, I was going to say. And so something else starts, which is not LinkedIn groups, and this is much better because we don't have the same competitive thing. We're not all just trying... I'm trying not to use the term... No, I'm not going to use that term. I'll stop there. But, you know, that competition kind of thing, swinging certain appendages. But they inherently then become that. I think this is really hit on a hot topic for me, which is this whole communities thing, is look, be it Facebook groups, Google, whatever it is. I'm seeing the connectivity and contribution across communities rise in a huge way. But I still feel that duplication is an issue and you can't spread yourself too thin. Yeah, you can't spread yourself too thin. And quality of content. The quality degenerates over time to a babble. Yeah. There's a Yahoo groups on service management, right? No, I left Yahoo years ago. Can't stand it. Yeah, I know. That's what I mean. Exactly. And the idle wizard, you know, satirical guy on my blog who talks rubbish about idle. My fertile field for that is I go back to the Yahoo groups to see what's being said on Yahoo groups and I get a fantastic mine of pure drivel because that's all there is there. Because it's the oldest community and it's just degenerated into nothing but piffle. Yeah, but I think that's also... It's not just about the participants and the drivel that went through. I think it was a great idea when it started and I was participating in various communities there. But I think what happened, it got too complicated. I'm looking at Facebook groups and, for example, what we're doing now with Google Communities, it's easier to use. It's easier to actually participate. Even if it's just clicking the like or the plus one, it's an acknowledgement. You know that someone's actually listened or heard and even if they don't have time to comment as such. Well, it's interesting, though. There's been a bit of a conversation on the Back to ITCM group over the last couple of days around... They've been experimenting with pinning to the top. And Chris is sort of looking at how we might be able to use that. Yes. And I think he's hit on something there because it's so easy. You know you've seen something in that group and you want to go and find it and you've got to search back. And that's the issue. It's great for that immediacy and if you're there and having the conversation. Yes. But as a form of curating content, it's not quite good. I almost never go to the Facebook Back to ITCM group now. I sit on Google+. I'm playing with that a little bit more now. No, I sit on both. I'll make you a prediction that by the end of 2013, the Facebook group will be piffle. It'll have degenerated into a chat group. You might be right on that, I think, Rob. But I think the actual movement itself and that group of people that are coming together and really sort of sharing in a good and collaborative way will still keep doing it in whatever way. So I think, yeah, onto Google. They'll move on to new channels because every channel degenerates into a babble. So they'll move on to Google+, and then they'll move on to whatever comes after that. Well, what about the impact on knowledge management then? Because I think that's another hot topic because everything we're talking about is about collaborating and sharing knowledge. Yeah, I see social media as unmanaged knowledge to some extent. It's a great way of getting stuff, but then you've got to have your own things in place to sort of manage how you sort of collate and distribute that. Social media is a river of knowledge. It's not a storehouse of knowledge. It flows and it's gone. That touches on your other point, Rob. You're talking about the two sides of the social media, and the other one is that using it as a channel into your service channels. And I've said in the past that it is just another channel, and if you've got crappy support, it's just another way of getting to crappy support. But I've seen in the last year some organisations, one in particular that I may or may not be working for right now, who are actually starting to get it right. They're really putting some effort into that. And getting some good feedback on actually you're really helping. Because what they're doing is then still probably manually transferring it into the current tools you have. But they're actually really starting to manage that well. It's not about automation. It's about the people on the tool. Oh, that's exactly what I was going to come back to that point before. You've got to have, it's all about the people. But the vendors are all salivating about linking the social media into you. There was that idiot with that video that I raved about a while ago. Yeah. You know, ITSM is rubbish and don't go to any of the conferences and it's all bilge. Yeah. Which was just, anyway. I was on a train in Canada last year, and I tweeted, my goodness, this track is rough. You know, this Via Rail track is rough or something. And I got a tweet back within about 20 minutes saying, it's Via Rail here, Rob, which train are you on? We'd really like to know. Yeah. And it's nothing to do with tools. It's the people monitoring the streams. And I've seen this, you know, people struggle with this. Probably a really good example, University of Canterbury during the earthquakes last year, you know, did some amazing work around social media and getting information out there. But as people got more and more used to it and had more expectations on it, you know, I think the university started to struggle to actually keep up with just that flow of, you know, and people expecting that immediate answer. So, you know, there's a whole lot of challenges around that that, you know, remain to be answered. I want to have whatever Emory's hovering because Mark Kawasaki and Farrah just, they seem to have really understood that whole knowledge sharing, the whole use of channels and everything through that IT service management and their service desk teams and getting their people to participate. See, this is the thing. People forget this is about, this is still about how humans interact. It is. What's my, you know, my mantra is always, you know, everybody talks about, you know, people, process, technology, but, you know, obviously the people is the most important because you can have the best tool in the world, the best process in the world. If somebody in your service desk is having a bad day, they're going to crap all over the whole thing. Unless they understand how people want to communicate, that's, you know, and how they like to interact and keep evolving and moving with that, then it's not going to improve. And it's not about whizzy tools. No. Again, you know, it's about the people. I think we've probably got another hour or so that we can talk on that and I think we shall. But just, I'm aware of, I'm aware that time's marching on. List of events coming up for 2013. Exactly. The first one, I think, in terms of the timetable that we've got going, HGAA actually have their March workshops, which are now open for registrations. And it's Houston, we have a problem. Andrew Sauter from Thinking Dimensions is going to be facilitating the workshop. Oh, excellent. Really exciting stuff, especially since we had him on, what was it, episode 15, I think, the incidents? And chaos one. Yep. So that's the March ones. And then there's some conference in New Zealand, isn't there, Tristan? There is. Is there? Again? Really? There is indeed. And actually we're moving it back to Auckland this year to give it another go up here. The Jeffers. Indeed. We won't explain what that is. You'll have to come to the conference to find out. To the elegant Pullman Hotel. Yes. Yeah, so we've got our call for presentations out at the moment. And we're obviously still looking for sponsors for all those of you out there who are listening. So yeah, so anybody who's in the country and keen to come and talk, we'd love to hear from you. Submissions close on the 18th of January. But don't panic. You don't have to have written the whole thing by then. That's just an abstract and a speaker bio so that we can start making some decisions around what we do. TFT13 submissions are also coming in now. Do you know what my issue with that is, though, and I'm not sure what is going to resonate with people. It's funny, isn't it, because you're going to put up a topic that you think might be of interest. Well, I guess that's where the people speak. Yeah. They get the choice. Yeah, you take your chance on what you think they might want to hear and they'll soon let you know. And look how well it worked for television. They make shows that people want to watch. Exactly. And then they cancel the ones that people want to watch. And then, of course, there's IT Smith Australia, the leader conference in early August in Canberra. Yes. Which I'm assuming the weather in Canberra at that time of the year will be absolutely stunning. Yeah. Lovely Canberra, lovely August. Good luck flying in. Well, I've actually lived there. So recommendations, guys, always fly in the night before, never the morning of, because you just can never trust whether it's going to be rain, fog, hail, shine. And actually, well, you could try it because you might end up getting redirected to Melbourne. Or Sydney or Brisbane, and they might be preferred. However. It's the only place I've ever had three goes at landing. And then there's Oceania CACs in Adelaide in September. So for those who live over Adelaide way, especially, and you want to sample a bit of ISACA stuff. A bit of CAC. Oh, not CAC. A bit of COVID CAC. Then Oceania CACs in Adelaide, 23 to 27 September. Cool. I think that's good. That's enough to keep people going. The other thing with events too is that keep your eye out on the Back to ITSM community on Google, because they're starting to do the regular hangouts now. Oh, exactly. That's rare. That's good. I haven't had a chance to get into one of those. So pick of the month. Do we have picks of the month? I've got one that I've sent a link for in the show notes, which was, and to my regret, I can't remember where I got the link from. My apologies. I think it was someone on Twitter. But it's a presentation. By Jan Corhonen of EDS in, I think, the Netherlands. And it's called BPM, a systemic perspective, which sounds like an exciting topic. But when you get into it, it's the most extraordinary analysis of systems and human interactions and process and non-process oriented approaches to systems. For the analytical geeky wonks like me digging into this standard and case kind of stuff, it's just quite brilliant. So we'll put a link in the show notes. So if you're into that kind of thing, then have a look at Jan's presentation.

It's on Hey Hey It's Saturday with the big gong. Gong. Gong, time off. But she is so much, she is so, so much better looking. That's true. And probably subtle, the person who's speaking, because some of the people that we've spoken to, you know, suddenly sit down and you can tell. They feel that they're going to be there for ten minutes. You know, it's their moment of fame. They just get this quiet tap on the back to say, go, move on. But I must say, I really enjoyed, I mean, all our guests have been great, you know, and thanks to them all. But I think, you know, for me, Fred Luddy was a bit of a coup, because we were invited to talk to Fred. We didn't approach ServiceNow or Fred. And Rob and I made a particular point not to talk about the company as much as we could, but to talk about the man and his journey. And I think he was, you know, some of the things he said were pretty inspirational. And I love the picture that Tristan used for the podcast about someone rolling the sleeves up. And that's exactly what he did. You know, he said he still programs, he still gets his hands dirty. I was going to use a photo of a toilet, because as I said, I love that analogy. But I thought, you know, it's not quite appropriate. So we'll make that one. No. Chris might have. You know, I was thinking just the other day about favourite podcasts. Thinking about not just our podcast, but podcasts in general. And realised that there's only one podcast in the world where I make a point of getting, listening to every single episode. Can you guess what it is? The Bugle. No. Practitioner Radio. Yeah. Chris and Troy de Moulin. Yeah. Absolutely. I went right back through. I didn't start listening until they're up to about 17 or 18. And I went right back through the back catalogue as well. As religiously catching up with every new one that comes out. That's just awesome. That really is. Yeah. I'm a little bit behind at the moment, but I'm starting to walk in the evenings again. So I'll catch up. Me too. Must listen to more. Yeah. So I'll put a link in the show notes to that one, as well as the TF T12 and all the things that we've mentioned. We've had a couple of issues again with the technology and we've lost Kaz, but we're going to carry on and finish this off without her. But she's here with us in spirit, obviously. So we sort of discussed the favourite podcasts of the year. I've enjoyed every one I've been on. And we're certainly looking forward to bringing more to you next year. And I think I've got two or three ideas out of the discussion tonight of what we can do. So that's probably a good segue into the next thing we were going to talk about, which is predictions for 2013. I haven't done my homework, so I don't actually have. I haven't had time to think about really predictions for 2013. I'm kind of thinking day to day at the moment. More than anything. So I'm going to throw this open to you, Simone and Rob, and see what you... I'm sure that, Rob, you've been talking to the Swami. Well, yeah, I hitchhiked down to the West Coast and found him living on a commune up the back of Hokitika. So after I sobered him up a bit and had a wee chat to him, I got a few coherent things out of the IT Swami. He said that bring your own device will, of course, be even more mainstream next year. And that's something we're really going to have to cope with. And I think my views on that are well documented in the blog in terms of, you know, it's an organisational decision that needs to be escalated to the correct levels to make it one way or another. And then either IT needs to shut up and enable it or users have to shut up and get on with their jobs, depending on which way the decision goes. But that's going to be real hardcore this year. I reckon it's going to get even more of an issue than it was. And of course, BYOD, Android's going to win. Uh-huh. OK. There's more Android devices shipping than Apple devices by about two or three to one now. Isn't it interesting that Apple are now becoming what Microsoft used to be? I'm more interested in the BYO KFC. Bring your own McNuggets? Yeah, exactly. Or some spicy wings. In fact, I might have to go for a wander after this next year. Now I've got KFC on my head. Yeah, yes. You have to add the bacon and cheese, remember. Exactly. But if you walk there, it's healthy. Ah, right. OK. I think, Tristan, that your prediction for 2013 is that you're going to have a more balanced life, isn't it? I'm certainly going to. Well, I don't know. I think there is balance because I've just, one of my mates and I have decided we're going to do a beer challenge next year and we're going to do 365 beers in 365 days. It's different New Zealand craft beers. So to balance that out, I'm thinking I should also run a 5K or a 10K run at some stage. Every day. While you listen to practitioner radio. Exactly. But I know if something, you know, with my prediction before of something, you know, something has to always give, I know of those two, which is going to give. Well, I usually don't like to do too many predictions because it's like hedging your bets a bit, isn't it? It's like, do I really put that money down on the nose on that horse? I actually normally put it down on its feet. I mean, I'm usually pretty good at that sort of things. But, you know, it's pretty hard to tell with the fillies out in this field for ITSM next year. What I'd like to see is service catalogue issues, resolved positively. Like, you know, I'd like people to just sort of get over all this complexity and, you know, really focus on the simplicity of what the whole reason it's there for, which is communication. Amen, sister. Jesus, have I been fighting that good fight or what the last few months? I'm just about over it, I tell you. I now have a prediction. Yeah? That won't happen. Oh, thanks. What, just because I said it? No, just because how many years beating our heads against brick walls? I'm far too cynical tonight. Well, this is the other thing where I think that it's really going to help it. I think the other thing I'm seeing now happening, and I think it's really going to, I'd like to see it take a real hold within support, which is the social media channels and communities being used the right way. But the thing is, is that they haven't truly adopted it anyway at this point. So I'd really like to see that come into service, if you like. You know, a lot of the organisations are already using it. So I'd really like to see support actually, you know, participating and using these channels to their advantage and to the advantage of the people they're there to support. As another channel to service desks or to support, yeah. Well, yes. I mean, there are some, some of those channels can work quite well. And I think the other thing is, though, is again, back to skill sets, is that each of those channels does have a different type of writing style or focus or need. You know, I mean, 140 characters is not a lot to be effusively polite. So, you know, understanding how to write that versus a Google community or a Facebook community, you know, there's different ways of doing it. I would love to see somebody being actually honest about their service catalogue and say, we do stuff, we have no idea what it is, and we'll make it up as we go along because we haven't actually documented any of it. And just see how that actually goes down with the business. Well, you know, I've got plans for your conference next year, Tristan. So we'll see how that pans out. It's one of those bugbears for me. And I just really want people to sit back and stop getting caught up in the whirlwind of it and communicate. That's what it's there for. You know who's not going to help is the vendors because now that CMDB's been... What's that? What's CMDB? Yeah, exactly. Now that CMDB is a deceased equine. Wow. In sensible circles. That's what the D stands for, isn't it? Yeah, that's right. It's a CMB deceased. Yeah, that's right. Now they can no longer flog that horse. The vendors have all moved on to automated provisioning and request catalogues. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with that. Again, as long as it's actually the hinge point is put the right way. Yeah, but so now we're over-hyping those as the solution to all the social ills and we're telling everybody that that is the service catalogue when, of course, that's bollocks. It's not. Ah, magic button, silver bullet stuff again. Yeah, exactly. So I don't think that'll get any better next year. I expect to be involved in a number of more stouches around service catalogue next year. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to be... I think it's going to become a little bit more normal. I think people are going to finally start getting it. I'd really like to see that happen. And I think the social media channels in these communities, etc, might actually make a difference that way. Well, there's two social media issues, right? There's using it in support as a tool. Yes. And there's social media as the communication tool. amongst us service management philosophers, right? So I'm all for service desks and service operatives using it as a channel. In terms of our community, I coined England's law earlier this year, which is that all social media channels degenerate into a babble. Yeah, and you know what? You do see that happen. Something new will start and everybody gets into it and it's all good because this is... LinkedIn grew. Yeah, I was going to say. And so something else starts, which is not LinkedIn groups, and this is much better because we don't have the same competitive thing. We're not all just trying... I'm trying not to use the term... No, I'm not going to use that term. I'll stop there. But, you know, that competition kind of thing, swinging certain appendages. But they inherently then become that. I think this is really hit on a hot topic for me, which is this whole communities thing, is look, be it Facebook groups, Google, whatever it is. I'm seeing the connectivity and contribution across communities rise in a huge way. But I still feel that duplication is an issue and you can't spread yourself too thin. Yeah, you can't spread yourself too thin. And quality of content. The quality degenerates over time to a babble. Yeah. There's a Yahoo groups on service management, right? No, I left Yahoo years ago. Can't stand it. Yeah, I know. That's what I mean. Exactly. And the idle wizard, you know, satirical guy on my blog who talks rubbish about idle. My fertile field for that is I go back to the Yahoo groups to see what's being said on Yahoo groups and I get a fantastic mine of pure drivel because that's all there is there. Because it's the oldest community and it's just degenerated into nothing but piffle. Yeah, but I think that's also... It's not just about the participants and the drivel that went through. I think it was a great idea when it started and I was participating in various communities there. But I think what happened, it got too complicated. I'm looking at Facebook groups and, for example, what we're doing now with Google Communities, it's easier to use. It's easier to actually participate. Even if it's just clicking the like or the plus one, it's an acknowledgement. You know that someone's actually listened or heard and even if they don't have time to comment as such. Well, it's interesting, though. There's been a bit of a conversation on the Back to ITCM group over the last couple of days around... They've been experimenting with pinning to the top. And Chris is sort of looking at how we might be able to use that. Yes. And I think he's hit on something there because it's so easy. You know you've seen something in that group and you want to go and find it and you've got to search back. And that's the issue. It's great for that immediacy and if you're there and having the conversation. Yes. But as a form of curating content, it's not quite good. I almost never go to the Facebook Back to ITCM group now. I sit on Google+. I'm playing with that a little bit more now. No, I sit on both. I'll make you a prediction that by the end of 2013, the Facebook group will be piffle. It'll have degenerated into a chat group. You might be right on that, I think, Rob. But I think the actual movement itself and that group of people that are coming together and really sort of sharing in a good and collaborative way will still keep doing it in whatever way. So I think, yeah, onto Google. They'll move on to new channels because every channel degenerates into a babble. So they'll move on to Google+, and then they'll move on to whatever comes after that. Well, what about the impact on knowledge management then? Because I think that's another hot topic because everything we're talking about is about collaborating and sharing knowledge. Yeah, I see social media as unmanaged knowledge to some extent. It's a great way of getting stuff, but then you've got to have your own things in place to sort of manage how you sort of collate and distribute that. Social media is a river of knowledge. It's not a storehouse of knowledge. It flows and it's gone. That touches on your other point, Rob. You're talking about the two sides of the social media, and the other one is that using it as a channel into your service channels. And I've said in the past that it is just another channel, and if you've got crappy support, it's just another way of getting to crappy support. But I've seen in the last year some organisations, one in particular that I may or may not be working for right now, who are actually starting to get it right. They're really putting some effort into that. And getting some good feedback on actually you're really helping. Because what they're doing is then still probably manually transferring it into the current tools you have. But they're actually really starting to manage that well. It's not about automation. It's about the people on the tool. Oh, that's exactly what I was going to come back to that point before. You've got to have, it's all about the people. But the vendors are all salivating about linking the social media into you. There was that idiot with that video that I raved about a while ago. Yeah. You know, ITSM is rubbish and don't go to any of the conferences and it's all bilge. Yeah. Which was just, anyway. I was on a train in Canada last year, and I tweeted, my goodness, this track is rough. You know, this Via Rail track is rough or something. And I got a tweet back within about 20 minutes saying, it's Via Rail here, Rob, which train are you on? We'd really like to know. Yeah. And it's nothing to do with tools. It's the people monitoring the streams. And I've seen this, you know, people struggle with this. Probably a really good example, University of Canterbury during the earthquakes last year, you know, did some amazing work around social media and getting information out there. But as people got more and more used to it and had more expectations on it, you know, I think the university started to struggle to actually keep up with just that flow of, you know, and people expecting that immediate answer. So, you know, there's a whole lot of challenges around that that, you know, remain to be answered. I want to have whatever Emory's hovering because Mark Kawasaki and Farrah just, they seem to have really understood that whole knowledge sharing, the whole use of channels and everything through that IT service management and their service desk teams and getting their people to participate. See, this is the thing. People forget this is about, this is still about how humans interact. It is. What's my, you know, my mantra is always, you know, everybody talks about, you know, people, process, technology, but, you know, obviously the people is the most important because you can have the best tool in the world, the best process in the world. If somebody in your service desk is having a bad day, they're going to crap all over the whole thing. Unless they understand how people want to communicate, that's, you know, and how they like to interact and keep evolving and moving with that, then it's not going to improve. And it's not about whizzy tools. No. Again, you know, it's about the people. I think we've probably got another hour or so that we can talk on that and I think we shall. But just, I'm aware of, I'm aware that time's marching on. List of events coming up for 2013. Exactly. The first one, I think, in terms of the timetable that we've got going, HGAA actually have their March workshops, which are now open for registrations. And it's Houston, we have a problem. Andrew Sauter from Thinking Dimensions is going to be facilitating the workshop. Oh, excellent. Really exciting stuff, especially since we had him on, what was it, episode 15, I think, the incidents? And chaos one. Yep. So that's the March ones. And then there's some conference in New Zealand, isn't there, Tristan? There is. Is there? Again? Really? There is indeed. And actually we're moving it back to Auckland this year to give it another go up here. The Jeffers. Indeed. We won't explain what that is. You'll have to come to the conference to find out. To the elegant Pullman Hotel. Yes. Yeah, so we've got our call for presentations out at the moment. And we're obviously still looking for sponsors for all those of you out there who are listening. So yeah, so anybody who's in the country and keen to come and talk, we'd love to hear from you. Submissions close on the 18th of January. But don't panic. You don't have to have written the whole thing by then. That's just an abstract and a speaker bio so that we can start making some decisions around what we do. TFT13 submissions are also coming in now. Do you know what my issue with that is, though, and I'm not sure what is going to resonate with people. It's funny, isn't it, because you're going to put up a topic that you think might be of interest. Well, I guess that's where the people speak. Yeah. They get the choice. Yeah, you take your chance on what you think they might want to hear and they'll soon let you know. And look how well it worked for television. They make shows that people want to watch. Exactly. And then they cancel the ones that people want to watch. And then, of course, there's IT Smith Australia, the leader conference in early August in Canberra. Yes. Which I'm assuming the weather in Canberra at that time of the year will be absolutely stunning. Yeah. Lovely Canberra, lovely August. Good luck flying in. Well, I've actually lived there. So recommendations, guys, always fly in the night before, never the morning of, because you just can never trust whether it's going to be rain, fog, hail, shine. And actually, well, you could try it because you might end up getting redirected to Melbourne. Or Sydney or Brisbane, and they might be preferred. However. It's the only place I've ever had three goes at landing. And then there's Oceania CACs in Adelaide in September. So for those who live over Adelaide way, especially, and you want to sample a bit of ISACA stuff. A bit of CAC. Oh, not CAC. A bit of COVID CAC. Then Oceania CACs in Adelaide, 23 to 27 September. Cool. I think that's good. That's enough to keep people going. The other thing with events too is that keep your eye out on the Back to ITSM community on Google, because they're starting to do the regular hangouts now. Oh, exactly. That's rare. That's good. I haven't had a chance to get into one of those. So pick of the month. Do we have picks of the month? I've got one that I've sent a link for in the show notes, which was, and to my regret, I can't remember where I got the link from. My apologies. I think it was someone on Twitter. But it's a presentation. By Jan Corhonen of EDS in, I think, the Netherlands. And it's called BPM, a systemic perspective, which sounds like an exciting topic. But when you get into it, it's the most extraordinary analysis of systems and human interactions and process and non-process oriented approaches to systems. For the analytical geeky wonks like me digging into this standard and case kind of stuff, it's just quite brilliant. So we'll put a link in the show notes. So if you're into that kind of thing, then have a look at Jan's presentation.
