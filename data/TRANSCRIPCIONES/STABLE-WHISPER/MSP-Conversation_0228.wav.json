{"text": " And then they sit in the editor's room together. And something that was really interesting was that all of them, because they're all writers of things that other people put on. One was a screenwriter, one was a television writer, one was a playwright. And they were all Columbia MFAs. That was sort of the reason that they got this specific group together. Was that they all said something that I thought was really interesting, which was that the script lives and dies during the writing process, then it lives and dies during the portrayal process, the acting, the actual portrayal of it, and then it lives and dies again in the editing room. I thought that was really interesting, because sometimes I feel like that about our podcast, where I'm super done with either the episode of the show or the conversation that we're having in the middle of it. We don't spend a lot of time in the writer's room, comparatively. Yeah, we hardly are in the writer's room. But for the first season of both the podcast and of the show, we did a lot of writer's room stuff. We did a lot of pre-talking and planning and stuff. And then at this point, I feel like we barely planned. We're like, let's just go. So it was just really interesting. She talked about group scenes and how those are actually the hardest. They call them killing fields. Because, like, you know, I think it's called, I would guess, they're called killing fields because every joke's punchline is called a bomb. So, like, when you have a group scene like that, everyone gets, like... Everyone gets to drop a bomb. Yes. And, you know, at the end, you end up with this, like, all the feel. A barren feel. Maybe that's why. I would guess. I don't know. Metaphors. I don't fucking know. Either way, they... So she wrote us a bit from the Jimmy Jab games, where everyone's, like, in the briefing room and Holt and Terry are like, so there's motorcade and blah, blah, blah, and there's been a delay, and we have to go to One Police Plaza, so they leave, and then, you know, it's the part with the joke about Arma and Jimmy Jab being... Arma and Jimmy Jab. Yeah, exactly. And I love that joke. And she read from the script that Jake says when the king of Iraq, Arma and Jimmy Jab, and she... And then Rosa corrects him in the script, both parts, in one line. Right. Whereas, like, here they broke it up, like, in the air version. Yeah. And that wasn't done in editing. Apparently, um, the actress, Stephanie Beatrice, was like, it's too hard to say. Like... Saying all at once, President of Iran, Arma and Jimmy Jab? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Like, it was just, like, it wasn't... Flowing. Yeah, it didn't feel natural. Plus, it has, like, that nice, like, punchy feel to it, I feel. Which is characteristic of Rosa. Yes, exactly. She wouldn't wait until he is finished making his mistake to correct him. Yeah, exactly. There was also the... Before that, though, Holt and Terry walk out of the room, and you see Jake kind of, like, stand up and crane his neck and kind of go, guys, guys, guys, guys, in that, like, well, for us, it's a stage whisper, but, like, we're expected to believe that in-universe it's a whisper whisper. Are we? Yes. Okay. Usually, so, usually stage whispers are not, are intended to be whisper whispers, like, in the universe of the space. I know about suspension of disbelief. Okay, cool. I said to the fiction editor. To the science fiction editor. Visual and, like, performative media are different from written media. True. But the idea of the suspension, you have to either buy in or you don't, right? Yeah. That's how all stories work. Either you in or you're out. All stories. Yeah. Safer history. No. Puns, too, apparently. So, she said that that part in the script, it's written just with Jake being like, guys, guys, like, no, not even, like, I'm overdoing it because the change that was made was made because she was on, so, like, we see them were saying she was on set, and she was, like, she thought about it, and she's like, it doesn't make sense for Jake to just say something at full volume, like, come around, let's do a thing, I have an idea. Because she was saying, like, you know, Holt and Terry have just left the room, right? If Jake were to speak in, like, full voice in that scene, she was saying, like, you know, the natural expectation is for Holt and Terry to come back in and be like, what are you doing, Peralta? That is something that they have developed over the course of history, because I've been watching a shit ton of Friends, and people just have really loud conversations in the same room as the person they can be secret from in every episode, and, yeah. Yeah. Better tech here. Well, I think, I think also naturalism has become more important to the television audiences, like, now. Well, especially since it's no longer laugh track comedy. That has fallen out of favor, yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of alienating effects in Friends. Well, especially if you're, like, a modern, like, now era TV viewer, right? Yeah. Like, it's a very, there's a lot of There are a lot of shows from the 90s that I have a lot of trouble watching nowadays, just because, like, the style is so different. Um, Mad About You is actually a really good example. I can't, like, the Helen Hunt show, I can't, don't worry, the point of the story is that that show is done in a really way, in a way that's, like, really weird, I feel, for an audience now. Some of those older shows just don't, it's not that they don't, quote unquote, travel well, it's that, you know, the aesthetic is just something really different for us now. Whereas, like, a show like Happy Days, which is not very naturalistic and has a laugh track, or the Dick Van Dyke show, which has a laugh track and is naturalistic in certain specific ways, but not in all ways, is, um, those don't feel as jarring to me. But I feel like on some of those older sitcoms, because the tech was, like, so, like, less, when they were doing things like, you know, they're having a secret discussion or, like, kind of a quieter conversation, they would, like, bring the camera in really close. So you got the sense that even though they were speaking at full voice, it was intended, the effect was, like, they are speaking very quietly because we're in a huddle, you know? So, the point being was, she was, like, okay, well, she said when she was on set, all these things occurred to her, it's, like, so she said, she pulled Sandberg aside and was, like, hey, can you try it, like, in a loud whisper? Because she didn't want to take the sound guy's life's hell. Yeah, yeah. And so, you know, she was, like, can you kind of, like, kind of leave the room and, like, you're doing something that's, like, kind of secretive? Because you are. And it made the, it gave the whole scene the right, like, sort of, like... Immediate tension. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Even, even, and she was saying, like, even giving the stage direction of, like, you know, whisper here or whatever, it changes the body language. Yeah. And it affects the entire scene from there on. And I thought that was really cool. So it was just really awesome listening to that. So, like, she talked a lot about the script and the process and everything, but one of the things that I thought was really cool was that, like, that was probably most interesting for our audience, because I know we have a lot of, like, the fic writers for the fandom, kind of, who also listen to our podcast. One of the things she said was, like, that I thought was particularly cool was that, you know, coming from the writers' room, they all have a very different perspective on the characters than we as the audience do. And she explained it differently the way that we do. I don't know what I'm going to say, but, you know, what I feel like she was going for was that to these writers, like, these characters have, like, a 24-hour life, you know? And they, as the writing team, are aware of this and are sort of having this thinking in the back of their minds. Like, they know that these people, these characters, like, are, you know, they're people. They're comedy, like, sort of, you know, tropes at times, but they're also, like, people. They're characters. And so, like, for us, like, from the viewer perspective, like, you and I have intuited some of, I think, these things, just because... We think about them a lot. Yeah, and, you know, you come from, like, a literary critical position, and I come from, like, a lot of, like, television knowledge, right? And so you see, I think both of us are coming at this from specific critical standpoints that allow us to intuit some of these, like, broader ideas about these characters that we don't necessarily know for sure. But we can guess or figure. So one thing she mentioned specifically was something that you and I have kind of talked around a little bit on this show, or on this podcast, about this show, which is that one of their fundamental truths about Jake is that Jake never will want to be captain. Good. We figured it out. Yeah, we've talked about that. Like, we've talked about, like, maybe he'll go to the FBI or something, but that... Yeah, yeah. But he doesn't want to be captain. No. He doesn't want to be an authority figure. No. Amy does, but Jake does not. Yeah, obviously. And if Jake ends up being captain, and she was, Luxury Syndrome was saying, like, it's either the end of the show or something fundamental has changed in that character. Yeah. Like, but Jake is, like, a brilliant detective, and his whole thing is that he likes being on the ground solving puzzles. That was established in the pilot, and when she said this, it, like, clicked for me. Like, I saw it. Like, we had talked about it, but it was nice to not only have that, like, codified, I guess, because it is effectively, like, word of God, right? The trope word of God, where it's, like, it's coming from people who are directly involved with the show, who have direct control over which direction the show goes. So it was really interesting. When she said that, I was like, that is, one, that was validating for us, right? Because our analysis has moved in that direction. But it was, too, it was, like, one of those things where it's, like, that's not something that the show ever has stated explicitly. Yeah. But we see it in every one of Jake's actions, right? I mean, I'm sure that there are other truths about Jake that we've intuited. Things like he is actually Charles' friend. Yeah. Like, he views Charles as, like, a valuable person. That's not, like, a secret, though. No, no, no, no. But it's, like, never... It is said explicitly in a variety of ways. True, true. Like, he considers him a brother. True, true. Voluntarily. I guess they did codify that now. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, but, like, there are these other things about these characters. There are points at which we were intuiting that. Yeah. I actually said to her something that you and I have talked about on the podcast, which is that the episodes... I said to her, I was like, Carl and I have noticed... I'm Carl. I was like, Carl, my co-host, and I have noticed that one of the things about your episodes that always stands out is that in them, very often, Rosa and Amy have, like, a really strong, like, you know, colleagues and friendship, like, bonding moment. And we appreciate that, because that's... It shows us... It's a small thing, but it's so consistent in the episodes you write that it's, like, something you clearly care about. She's like, yeah, I do. I'm glad you noticed that. Like, it was nice. It was just nice. Sounds like a fun time. Yeah, but she was super sweet and super nice, and I tweeted about it. This part I'll put keep. So I tweeted about it after it happened, and Marshall Boone was like, who? Wait, what? He was like, which one? And I was like, oh, actually, he's from there when I tweeted the picture of, like, the panel that I had. And he was like... He did the, like, Twitter cool, and I'm like, ah! The Aziz Ansari face. And then he was like... And he was like... He was like, she's so cool! I was like, she is really cool! Oh, it was great. It was just such a great experience to, like, meet this person, because it was just like... It was a great panel, first of all. All three... It was an all-female panel, and all women of... South Asian women, so, like, people who... Women who look like me, and who were doing this thing that, like, I've often, like, debated if I should just quit my job and do. You gotta cut that part. Well, I debated that when I was, like, first moving to New York, right? So... Okay. All these three women were doing this thing that, like, you know... That you value so highly. Yeah, and then I wish I had the gumption to sort of, you know, drop everything and do myself as well, you know? And I find excuses. But these people haven't. They've pursued that, and I admire that very greatly. So it's great to hear their perspective, both, like, as intelligent people who are really, like, thinking deeply about their work, but also, like, as women of color in an industry that has historically excluded us, both in the U.S. as well as even in India, right? Like, it's not like I could just go to India and, like, be like, all right, I'm gonna make movies here with my American money, and they'd be like, no, you're still a woman. You're still less... valuable to us in this society. So, like, you know, there's all this, like, politic around it, but it's just pretty... It was just great. The panel was really great. She was great to talk to me for so long, and it was just such a great experience. So I'm glad I got to do that. I'm glad that, like, I found out that, like, apparently the writing staff knows who we are, kind of, like, knows about our podcast. No pressure. No pressure. We'd better like some episodes. She was saying that the last run is really good. Like... I wouldn't be able to... No, no. She was also saying that episodes with two writers had to get done faster. Hmm. Which makes me actually wonder about Lockdown. Because Lockdown is a single writer. Interesting. But it's also one of their, like, head writers. Like, he's also, like, a producer for the show. She was also saying that... So they start writing again in May. So the writing staff comes back in May, but production will start up again in July. Uh-huh. And we're going to be on hiatus for most of that. No, we can't. But part of it is also, like, the scheduling for the production will be, like, thrown off. Because Samberg got announced that he's hosting the Emmys. Right. And those are in September. Right, right. And I believe from, like, interviews with Seth Meyers and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler that, like, it's like a month of work. Huh. So, like, August is, like, when they're filming. And he's, like, going to be helping writing the show. Like, that's sort of one of the host duties is to write all the, like, monologues and everything. And, like, the stuff that people say off the teleprompters and, you know, the opening jokes and things like that. And, like, coordinating... Emmy stuff. Yeah. The whole presentation, right? Like, it's a production. You end up, as the host, you're, like, part of the production, I guess. And so, like, yeah, he... Obviously, his two Lonely Island co-colleagues, Akiva Schaefer and Yorma Takone, are gonna... Takone? Takone? Whatever. Yorma! Yorma and Akiva are going to be, like, helping him. Because that's how they function. Yeah. But, like, it's still, like, he's... He can't be doing... It might be, like, down the block from each other, but he can't be doing both. Like, he literally can't be physically together with someone else. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So, they... She kind of hinted that, like, season two might have to be have... Weird release schedules? I guess, yeah. Or something's gonna... They might get delayed in their premiere. Might get pushed back to October for that reason. Or maybe Jake will go into a coma. So... So... Oh, my God. I hope not. Well, he can't. And you know why? Because she said that the A-plot is always the one that the lead character is in. Yeah. So, Jake... Well, yeah. And we know that. That's, like, an obvious thing. But, like, we... We... The Boyle-Linetti wedding, for example. Right? I guess, technically, Jake and Amy's plotline is the A-plot. Technically. Yeah. That's some news I had. I got followed on Twitter by Melissa Joan Hart. Really? Yeah. How? Well, she has 175,000 people that she's following. So, I'm guessing that there is no, like, single human at all involved in that account on a kind of exclusive being-a-person basis. Oh. Because, um... No one would ever read a timeline with 175,000 people on it. I have no idea how she found me. You must have tweeted something that her team is following. I really didn't. I don't know. That's... That's crazy, though. Yes. So, um... So, yeah. Uh... Uh... Uh... Our... We were saying about the Boyle-Linetti wedding. Oh! I asked her about Improvised. So, I got a chance to ask her a question. Yeah. Like, as part of the panel. And I asked her about, like, scenes, like, in the Jimmy Jab games, where, you know, Melissa Fimera told us, the audience, that the, are you saying I knocked you up? Like, bit on the balcony or whatever. Yeah. The smoking patio is... Was improvised. And she said that it was originally scripted. Um... And then they did, like, several takes. And they did alternate takes as well. Um... And then they... She was saying that they've worked with this team enough at this point that they can sort of intuit when they'll want to riff themselves. Like, do an improvised bit. And so, they let the actors do a fun run. They do let them do the improvised take. You were talking about the fun run earlier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mentioned that earlier. So, the fun run is just, like, the one where they get to, the actors get to sort of, sort of let loose and try and improvise and sort of react naturally in the scene. And, uh, they allow that, they like that take so much, obviously, that they kept it in the final cut. But it, it also makes me wonder, what the various proposal scenes fun runs look like. Certainly for, like, the Betts proposal scene, there is, that, that one would have been ridiculous. They'd have to clean up all the confetti and, like, do it again. Um... But, uh... Surely they don't, they don't do, like, something like a fun run with something with that... No, that... Heavy, uh, set up... Yeah. Clean up thing. Probably not. I would hope not. There are certain things you can only get one take of, right? Like, I know in, um, there's an indie movie from a couple years ago with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character gets, gets diagnosed with cancer. Yeah. And he has to shave his head. And the actor's like, I'll do it. So they got one take of him going, and Seth Rogen made me like, that's my balls trimmer. Like, Seth Rogen, it sounds bad when I say it like that, but it was actually, like, it was clearly, like, his character, Rogen's character in that movie is actually, trying really hard to stay cheerful despite, like, this, like, impending tragedy of his friend possibly dying. Yeah. So it's actually, like, that's, like, the moment where it's, like, really real for his character. And so, like, seeing his friend, like, shave his head. And so he's, like, trying to keep the mood light, but it's also, like, oh, this is actually happening. Um... So, yeah. Uh... Back to, back to Brooklyn at Nine. This was a really cool event, and I'm really glad we did this. And I'm also really tired of talking. So... I hope everyone enjoyed my couple stories. That's, this is literally the only reason we broke hiatus. I thought it was pretty cool. My, like, experiences? Yeah. I should've, I'm sorry, I should, I feel like I, I feel really bad, because I swore I asked you, like, in my head, I think I asked you, and you were like, I'm busy, sorry, bye. No, I was like, you know, I...", "segments": [{"start": 0.16, "end": 0.5, "text": " And", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [400], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.16713673321168815, "compression_ratio":

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " And then they sit in the editor's room together. And something that was really interesting was that all of them, because they're all writers of things that other people put on. One was a screenwriter, one was a television writer, one was a playwright. And they were all Columbia MFAs. That was sort of the reason that they got this specific group together. Was that they all said something that I thought was really interesting, which was that the script lives and dies during the writing process, then it lives and dies during the portrayal process, the acting, the actual portrayal of it, and then it lives and dies again in the editing room. I thought that was really interesting, because sometimes I feel like that about our podcast, where I'm super done with either the episode of the show or the conversation that we're having in the middle of it. We don't spend a lot of time in the writer's room, comparatively. Yeah, we hardly are in the writer's room. But for the first season of both the podcast and of the show, we did a lot of writer's room stuff. We did a lot of pre-talking and planning and stuff. And then at this point, I feel like we barely planned. We're like, let's just go. So it was just really interesting. She talked about group scenes and how those are actually the hardest. They call them killing fields. Because, like, you know, I think it's called, I would guess, they're called killing fields because every joke's punchline is called a bomb. So, like, when you have a group scene like that, everyone gets, like... Everyone gets to drop a bomb. Yes. And, you know, at the end, you end up with this, like, all the feel. A barren feel. Maybe that's why. I would guess. I don't know. Metaphors. I don't fucking know. Either way, they... So she wrote us a bit from the Jimmy Jab games, where everyone's, like, in the briefing room and Holt and Terry are like, so there's motorcade and blah, blah, blah, and there's been a delay, and we have to go to One Police Plaza, so they leave, and then, you know, it's the part with the joke about Arma and Jimmy Jab being... Arma and Jimmy Jab. Yeah, exactly. And I love that joke. And she read from the script that Jake says when the king of Iraq, Arma and Jimmy Jab, and she... And then Rosa corrects him in the script, both parts, in one line. Right. Whereas, like, here they broke it up, like, in the air version. Yeah. And that wasn't done in editing. Apparently, um, the actress, Stephanie Beatrice, was like, it's too hard to say. Like... Saying all at once, President of Iran, Arma and Jimmy Jab? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Like, it was just, like, it wasn't... Flowing. Yeah, it didn't feel natural. Plus, it has, like, that nice, like, punchy feel to it, I feel. Which is characteristic of Rosa. Yes, exactly. She wouldn't wait until he is finished making his mistake to correct him. Yeah, exactly. There was also the... Before that, though, Holt and Terry walk out of the room, and you see Jake kind of, like, stand up and crane his neck and kind of go, guys, guys, guys, guys, in that, like, well, for us, it's a stage whisper, but, like, we're expected to believe that in-universe it's a whisper whisper. Are we? Yes. Okay. Usually, so, usually stage whispers are not, are intended to be whisper whispers, like, in the universe of the space. I know about suspension of disbelief. Okay, cool. I said to the fiction editor. To the science fiction editor. Visual and, like, performative media are different from written media. True. But the idea of the suspension, you have to either buy in or you don't, right? Yeah. That's how all stories work. Either you in or you're out. All stories. Yeah. Safer history. No. Puns, too, apparently. So, she said that that part in the script, it's written just with Jake being like, guys, guys, like, no, not even, like, I'm overdoing it because the change that was made was made because she was on, so, like, we see them were saying she was on set, and she was, like, she thought about it, and she's like, it doesn't make sense for Jake to just say something at full volume, like, come around, let's do a thing, I have an idea. Because she was saying, like, you know, Holt and Terry have just left the room, right? If Jake were to speak in, like, full voice in that scene, she was saying, like, you know, the natural expectation is for Holt and Terry to come back in and be like, what are you doing, Peralta? That is something that they have developed over the course of history, because I've been watching a shit ton of Friends, and people just have really loud conversations in the same room as the person they can be secret from in every episode, and, yeah. Yeah. Better tech here. Well, I think, I think also naturalism has become more important to the television audiences, like, now. Well, especially since it's no longer laugh track comedy. That has fallen out of favor, yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of alienating effects in Friends. Well, especially if you're, like, a modern, like, now era TV viewer, right? Yeah. Like, it's a very, there's a lot of There are a lot of shows from the 90s that I have a lot of trouble watching nowadays, just because, like, the style is so different. Um, Mad About You is actually a really good example. I can't, like, the Helen Hunt show, I can't, don't worry, the point of the story is that that show is done in a really way, in a way that's, like, really weird, I feel, for an audience now. Some of those older shows just don't, it's not that they don't, quote unquote, travel well, it's that, you know, the aesthetic is just something really different for us now. Whereas, like, a show like Happy Days, which is not very naturalistic and has a laugh track, or the Dick Van Dyke show, which has a laugh track and is naturalistic in certain specific ways, but not in all ways, is, um, those don't feel as jarring to me. But I feel like on some of those older sitcoms, because the tech was, like, so, like, less, when they were doing things like, you know, they're having a secret discussion or, like, kind of a quieter conversation, they would, like, bring the camera in really close. So you got the sense that even though they were speaking at full voice, it was intended, the effect was, like, they are speaking very quietly because we're in a huddle, you know? So, the point being was, she was, like, okay, well, she said when she was on set, all these things occurred to her, it's, like, so she said, she pulled Sandberg aside and was, like, hey, can you try it, like, in a loud whisper? Because she didn't want to take the sound guy's life's hell. Yeah, yeah. And so, you know, she was, like, can you kind of, like, kind of leave the room and, like, you're doing something that's, like, kind of secretive? Because you are. And it made the, it gave the whole scene the right, like, sort of, like... Immediate tension. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Even, even, and she was saying, like, even giving the stage direction of, like, you know, whisper here or whatever, it changes the body language. Yeah. And it affects the entire scene from there on. And I thought that was really cool. So it was just really awesome listening to that. So, like, she talked a lot about the script and the process and everything, but one of the things that I thought was really cool was that, like, that was probably most interesting for our audience, because I know we have a lot of, like, the fic writers for the fandom, kind of, who also listen to our podcast. One of the things she said was, like, that I thought was particularly cool was that, you know, coming from the writers' room, they all have a very different perspective on the characters than we as the audience do. And she explained it differently the way that we do. I don't know what I'm going to say, but, you know, what I feel like she was going for was that to these writers, like, these characters have, like, a 24-hour life, you know? And they, as the writing team, are aware of this and are sort of having this thinking in the back of their minds. Like, they know that these people, these characters, like, are, you know, they're people. They're comedy, like, sort of, you know, tropes at times, but they're also, like, people. They're characters. And so, like, for us, like, from the viewer perspective, like, you and I have intuited some of, I think, these things, just because... We think about them a lot. Yeah, and, you know, you come from, like, a literary critical position, and I come from, like, a lot of, like, television knowledge, right? And so you see, I think both of us are coming at this from specific critical standpoints that allow us to intuit some of these, like, broader ideas about these characters that we don't necessarily know for sure. But we can guess or figure. So one thing she mentioned specifically was something that you and I have kind of talked around a little bit on this show, or on this podcast, about this show, which is that one of their fundamental truths about Jake is that Jake never will want to be captain. Good. We figured it out. Yeah, we've talked about that. Like, we've talked about, like, maybe he'll go to the FBI or something, but that... Yeah, yeah. But he doesn't want to be captain. No. He doesn't want to be an authority figure. No. Amy does, but Jake does not. Yeah, obviously. And if Jake ends up being captain, and she was, Luxury Syndrome was saying, like, it's either the end of the show or something fundamental has changed in that character. Yeah. Like, but Jake is, like, a brilliant detective, and his whole thing is that he likes being on the ground solving puzzles. That was established in the pilot, and when she said this, it, like, clicked for me. Like, I saw it. Like, we had talked about it, but it was nice to not only have that, like, codified, I guess, because it is effectively, like, word of God, right? The trope word of God, where it's, like, it's coming from people who are directly involved with the show, who have direct control over which direction the show goes. So it was really interesting. When she said that, I was like, that is, one, that was validating for us, right? Because our analysis has moved in that direction. But it was, too, it was, like, one of those things where it's, like, that's not something that the show ever has stated explicitly. Yeah. But we see it in every one of Jake's actions, right? I mean, I'm sure that there are other truths about Jake that we've intuited. Things like he is actually Charles' friend. Yeah. Like, he views Charles as, like, a valuable person. That's not, like, a secret, though. No, no, no, no. But it's, like, never... It is said explicitly in a variety of ways. True, true. Like, he considers him a brother. True, true. Voluntarily. I guess they did codify that now. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, but, like, there are these other things about these characters. There are points at which we were intuiting that. Yeah. I actually said to her something that you and I have talked about on the podcast, which is that the episodes... I said to her, I was like, Carl and I have noticed... I'm Carl. I was like, Carl, my co-host, and I have noticed that one of the things about your episodes that always stands out is that in them, very often, Rosa and Amy have, like, a really strong, like, you know, colleagues and friendship, like, bonding moment. And we appreciate that, because that's... It shows us... It's a small thing, but it's so consistent in the episodes you write that it's, like, something you clearly care about. She's like, yeah, I do. I'm glad you noticed that. Like, it was nice. It was just nice. Sounds like a fun time. Yeah, but she was super sweet and super nice, and I tweeted about it. This part I'll put keep. So I tweeted about it after it happened, and Marshall Boone was like, who? Wait, what? He was like, which one? And I was like, oh, actually, he's from there when I tweeted the picture of, like, the panel that I had. And he was like... He did the, like, Twitter cool, and I'm like, ah! The Aziz Ansari face. And then he was like... And he was like... He was like, she's so cool! I was like, she is really cool! Oh, it was great. It was just such a great experience to, like, meet this person, because it was just like... It was a great panel, first of all. All three... It was an all-female panel, and all women of... South Asian women, so, like, people who... Women who look like me, and who were doing this thing that, like, I've often, like, debated if I should just quit my job and do. You gotta cut that part. Well, I debated that when I was, like, first moving to New York, right? So... Okay. All these three women were doing this thing that, like, you know... That you value so highly. Yeah, and then I wish I had the gumption to sort of, you know, drop everything and do myself as well, you know? And I find excuses. But these people haven't. They've pursued that, and I admire that very greatly. So it's great to hear their perspective, both, like, as intelligent people who are really, like, thinking deeply about their work, but also, like, as women of color in an industry that has historically excluded us, both in the U.S. as well as even in India, right? Like, it's not like I could just go to India and, like, be like, all right, I'm gonna make movies here with my American money, and they'd be like, no, you're still a woman. You're still less... valuable to us in this society. So, like, you know, there's all this, like, politic around it, but it's just pretty... It was just great. The panel was really great. She was great to talk to me for so long, and it was just such a great experience. So I'm glad I got to do that. I'm glad that, like, I found out that, like, apparently the writing staff knows who we are, kind of, like, knows about our podcast. No pressure. No pressure. We'd better like some episodes. She was saying that the last run is really good. Like... I wouldn't be able to... No, no. She was also saying that episodes with two writers had to get done faster. Hmm. Which makes me actually wonder about Lockdown. Because Lockdown is a single writer. Interesting. But it's also one of their, like, head writers. Like, he's also, like, a producer for the show. She was also saying that... So they start writing again in May. So the writing staff comes back in May, but production will start up again in July. Uh-huh. And we're going to be on hiatus for most of that. No, we can't. But part of it is also, like, the scheduling for the production will be, like, thrown off. Because Samberg got announced that he's hosting the Emmys. Right. And those are in September. Right, right. And I believe from, like, interviews with Seth Meyers and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler that, like, it's like a month of work. Huh. So, like, August is, like, when they're filming. And he's, like, going to be helping writing the show. Like, that's sort of one of the host duties is to write all the, like, monologues and everything. And, like, the stuff that people say off the teleprompters and, you know, the opening jokes and things like that. And, like, coordinating... Emmy stuff. Yeah. The whole presentation, right? Like, it's a production. You end up, as the host, you're, like, part of the production, I guess. And so, like, yeah, he... Obviously, his two Lonely Island co-colleagues, Akiva Schaefer and Yorma Takone, are gonna... Takone? Takone? Whatever. Yorma! Yorma and Akiva are going to be, like, helping him. Because that's how they function. Yeah. But, like, it's still, like, he's... He can't be doing... It might be, like, down the block from each other, but he can't be doing both. Like, he literally can't be physically together with someone else. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So, they... She kind of hinted that, like, season two might have to be have... Weird release schedules? I guess, yeah. Or something's gonna... They might get delayed in their premiere. Might get pushed back to October for that reason. Or maybe Jake will go into a coma. So... So... Oh, my God. I hope not. Well, he can't. And you know why? Because she said that the A-plot is always the one that the lead character is in. Yeah. So, Jake... Well, yeah. And we know that. That's, like, an obvious thing. But, like, we... We... The Boyle-Linetti wedding, for example. Right? I guess, technically, Jake and Amy's plotline is the A-plot. Technically. Yeah. That's some news I had. I got followed on Twitter by Melissa Joan Hart. Really? Yeah. How? Well, she has 175,000 people that she's following. So, I'm guessing that there is no, like, single human at all involved in that account on a kind of exclusive being-a-person basis. Oh. Because, um... No one would ever read a timeline with 175,000 people on it. I have no idea how she found me. You must have tweeted something that her team is following. I really didn't. I don't know. That's... That's crazy, though. Yes. So, um... So, yeah. Uh... Uh... Uh... Our... We were saying about the Boyle-Linetti wedding. Oh! I asked her about Improvised. So, I got a chance to ask her a question. Yeah. Like, as part of the panel. And I asked her about, like, scenes, like, in the Jimmy Jab games, where, you know, Melissa Fimera told us, the audience, that the, are you saying I knocked you up? Like, bit on the balcony or whatever. Yeah. The smoking patio is... Was improvised. And she said that it was originally scripted. Um... And then they did, like, several takes. And they did alternate takes as well. Um... And then they... She was saying that they've worked with this team enough at this point that they can sort of intuit when they'll want to riff themselves. Like, do an improvised bit. And so, they let the actors do a fun run. They do let them do the improvised take. You were talking about the fun run earlier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mentioned that earlier. So, the fun run is just, like, the one where they get to, the actors get to sort of, sort of let loose and try and improvise and sort of react naturally in the scene. And, uh, they allow that, they like that take so much, obviously, that they kept it in the final cut. But it, it also makes me wonder, what the various proposal scenes fun runs look like. Certainly for, like, the Betts proposal scene, there is, that, that one would have been ridiculous. They'd have to clean up all the confetti and, like, do it again. Um... But, uh... Surely they don't, they don't do, like, something like a fun run with something with that... No, that... Heavy, uh, set up... Yeah. Clean up thing. Probably not. I would hope not. There are certain things you can only get one take of, right? Like, I know in, um, there's an indie movie from a couple years ago with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character gets, gets diagnosed with cancer. Yeah. And he has to shave his head. And the actor's like, I'll do it. So they got one take of him going, and Seth Rogen made me like, that's my balls trimmer. Like, Seth Rogen, it sounds bad when I say it like that, but it was actually, like, it was clearly, like, his character, Rogen's character in that movie is actually, trying really hard to stay cheerful despite, like, this, like, impending tragedy of his friend possibly dying. Yeah. So it's actually, like, that's, like, the moment where it's, like, really real for his character. And so, like, seeing his friend, like, shave his head. And so he's, like, trying to keep the mood light, but it's also, like, oh, this is actually happening. Um... So, yeah. Uh... Back to, back to Brooklyn at Nine. This was a really cool event, and I'm really glad we did this. And I'm also really tired of talking. So... I hope everyone enjoyed my couple stories. That's, this is literally the only reason we broke hiatus. I thought it was pretty cool. My, like, experiences? Yeah. I should've, I'm sorry, I should, I feel like I, I feel really bad, because I swore I asked you, like, in my head, I think I asked you, and you were like, I'm busy, sorry, bye.
