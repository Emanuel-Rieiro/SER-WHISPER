{"text": " It's a great pleasure to introduce to you Zeynep Tufekci, who's a Berkman faculty associate. She's kind of a rock star in our universe. We're delighted. Well, that happens to the best. We're delighted to have you here today. Zeynep is a professor at the University of North Carolina, where she teaches at the School of Information and Library Science, but also at the Sociology Department. She's combining many different disciplines in one person. She's a computer programmer. She's a technology expert. She's an ethnographer. She's a sociologist and brings that all together in her amazing work. She studies how technology is actually shaping society and drives social change. She's a wonderful writer. I encourage you, if you don't already do, to follow her op-eds in the New York Times, which are a must-read. And today she's here to present her new book, which is just out, Twitter and Tear Gas, the Power and Fragility of Network Protest. Unfortunately, we don't have enough copy here. It's the only one. But please order it. It's available. I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful book. Zeynep, we're so delighted to have you here and to host this first Cambridge Book Talk, right? Thank you. It is. It is. This is my very first book talk. Wow. Wonderful. I am so thrilled. Now, I really apologize. I went to the other building. I'm like, I guess nobody wants to hear. I'll just sit here. Maybe somebody will show up. And then I was rescued by saying, what are you doing here? I said, proving that having a PhD means nothing when it comes to practical stuff. So how should we allocate the question-answer time so I time myself correctly now that I'm a little late? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a little bit of a brief, I guess, overview. I won't go over everything. But I'll try to explain. And then I'll try to draw it out in the question-answer part, because I think that will be much more productive. And what I'm trying to puzzle through here is, what is this new network public sphere that we're all talking about evolving into? And I'm getting at this from the point of view of social movements. But to get from the point of view of social movements, you have to sort of discuss all the other dynamics that are emergent and that are becoming more and more solidified. So just very briefly to situate myself, I'm originally from Turkey. I grew up there. I grew up without the internet. I grew up without access to enough books. I used to have practically every single translated encyclopedia in Turkish, because that was a very finite amount. And my grandmother would buy them for me. So I had every one of them. And I would just reread them. So I grew up in a situation where you'd run out of things to read. And there was heavy censorship. You had one TV channel, and they'd show us Little House on the Prairie. It makes so little sense in the Middle East. I can't even explain how little sense. We don't have a frontier. Like, you dig, and there's like four civilizations and ten empires. So what is this middle of nowhere they're allegedly in? The reason we got that channel and that TV show was because it was after a military coup, which had established very strict controls over the public sphere, which lasted in some ways reverberating to this day. And there was a big conflict in the Kurdish Southeast that, of course, we didn't hear about. And then I, because I was a programmer by profession, I ended up working at IBM early on. And they had a global intranet before anybody in Turkey had internet. So I got a sense of, oh, wait. It was a bizarre project. We were localizing a MIDI system that was programmed on big mainframes that were built before I was born. And I was supposed to work on all the levels. And sometimes I'd have a question. And I'd be asking an IBM's intranet. And it would be someone in Japan would say, oh, yeah, I wrote that. Here's how you do it. I thought, this is amazing. I can't figure out what's going on in my own country. I can talk to someone in Japan who's going to help me, right? IBM's virtual network. So that kind of made me really, that experience in thinking about computers made me really interested in how this was going to change everything. And then internet came to Turkey. And I just jumped on it. And at the time, it was sort of the Taylor and of the Zapatista movement that had captured so much global attention. And they were allegedly using the internet a lot. I emailed people. And I showed up at their encuentros. They were holding these encuentros, bringing together activists together from around the world. And then I've been sort of following, participating, observing, thinking about these movements since then, which I trace from, like, I would trace it from the Zapatistas to the Seattle 99, the WTO protest, to the anti-corporate globalization protest, of the 90s, kind of. And then 9-11 happened, which changed a lot of things. And there was the anti-war movement. And then we had the latest way, which is the Occupy, the whole Arab uprising. And then it's still kind of, you have these different countries. Turkey is a part of protests. Hong Kong. So there's been a lot. If you look numerically, too, the number of protests has tripled or quadrupled, depending on how you measure. I bet if after you put 2017, it's going to be even more difficult. But, so here's one of the motivating puzzles of the book that we'll get to, that I'm trying to sort of get to with this book is, if digital technologies are indeed so empowering in so many ways, right, why are we also seeing authoritarianism on the rise around the world? How does that square with that? And if, especially since the tech world tends to be on the progressive, liberal, libertarian spectrum, so the makers and a lot of the early adopters of these technologies and the creators tend to be on one side of the political spectrum. But the movements, they end up synthesizing around the world. If you look at, you know, you go to Tahrir, lots of open source people there. You know, it's kind of this global thing. So technology confidence isn't the problem. But the movements have this cycle of getting very big and then not having the proportional impact you would expect from a movement with that level of energy showing. So I was trying to figure all of this out. So just, this is the book. And it's not out yet. So sorry, I don't have copies either. I guess it'll be out. So one of the things, I very quickly, I never use the term virtual because digital technologies are pervasive in everything we do. Online, offline, I didn't even find that useful anymore. They're part of social movements because they're part of life. And I think, finally, that debate may well be over. But, of course, the fact that they're part of life, I mean, they're not a separate world, right? They're part of this world. But they do have major impacts on this world. I look at them as one more set of technologies that's altering the space and time as we experience it, right? And this goes back to telegraph. It sort of allows you to talk across distance. Or writing, it allows you to preserve ephemeral thought over time. And space-altering technologies, tools, are very integral to our human culture. This is the latest iteration. It's changing the geography of our world in lots of ways. And computation is also bringing, introducing a new kind of intelligence, which isn't really in this book. So that's sort of just this big, broad thing. I don't talk virtual or not. This is, my data is very multi-level. This is me in Gizy Park protest. I have a helmet on because tear gas canisters aimed at your head are not good for someone in my profession or anyone else. But I also look at big data sets. I also look at other people's scholarship, right? So my book isn't based just on here are my, like, I did a lot of systematic interviews. I've been to, you know, protests in Tahrir. And I've been to all the Arab countries that were occupied here. But my book isn't just about my own primary research. I want it to synthesize. I know a lot of my research, obviously, is there. But I want it to synthesize. And this thing I'm studying, this is, I call this globalization from below, the movements. Because you've always had the powerful globalizing. This is a picture I took in Gizy Park protest in, I don't know, day two, day three. This lady, she's a Roma lady. And they sell flowers to tourists around Taksim. If you've ever been to Taksim Square, which is sort of the central square, they're selling flowers to tourists. And they're selling souvenirs and knickknacks. So the protests hit. And the whole place, of course, is now like, you know, that building, it's not supposed to have all those banners. Like, people just took over and occupied the whole place. And there are clashes. So what happens in two days? They have manufactured the Guy Fawkes masks somehow. And instead of selling flowers, they're selling goggles to protect your eyes from tear gas. In case you're into graffiti, here's your spray paint. And, like, they have sort of anti-tear gas stuff and you see these masks. I'm like, this is the leanest production just-in-time thing I've seen. In two days, they've completely shifted inventory. And then I pick these things up. And everybody knew what to do, right? The masks, the symbols, they're so globally recognized, even in Turkey. And I'm like, where did you get these masks? They're a little weird. If you've seen them elsewhere, they're like a little off. Then I realized they somehow downloaded a 2D picture from the internet and then somehow tinkered and figured out a 3D model from it. But, of course, it's not easy to get the 3D depth exactly right from the 2D picture. So they're a little off. They just somehow, you know, in one day, this is what they could do. So this is amazing to me that there's this global protest culture that is very recognizable with the tear gas and the Guy Fawkes and everybody. It was just for, you go a lot of places. Of course, every country is different, right? Every country is different. But as I traveled around, right, when I first saw, and I went to, you know, Egypt and I'm in Tahrir Square, I'm talking to people. And I'm like, well, okay, so maybe this is Egypt and Egypt has all these sort of peculiarities. And then you see the indignados movement in Spain and it's very horizontal. It's participatory. And it's Spain, you know. You have a tradition of that. Occupy and you're like, okay, it's New York. And you sort of see these similarities and you keep trying to add to the reasons why each one just convergent there. And then I went to Turkey, which never had a leaderless movement of size, right? Never had occupations like this. Doesn't have any of the cultural elements you see in Spain or something, a history of anarchist movements, participatory movements. And I found the movement that was really similar. And that's when I started thinking, you know what? It's really a global convergence. I keep explaining each one of them away. But there is a global pattern here. It doesn't mean there aren't peculiar, specific things to each movement. Of course there are. But there's a lot of globalization from below.", "segments": [{"start": 0.28, "end": 4.76, "text": " It's a great pleasure to introduce to you Zeynep Tufekci, who's a Berkman", "seek": 0.0, "tokens":

you Zeynep Tufekci, who's a Berkman faculty associate. She's kind of a rock star in our universe. We're delighted. Well, that happens to the best. We're delighted to have you here today. Zeynep is a professor at the University of North Carolina, where she teaches at the School of Information and Library Science, but also at the Sociology Department. She's combining many different disciplines in one person. She's a computer programmer. She's a technology expert. She's an ethnographer. She's a sociologist and brings that all together in her amazing work. She studies how technology is actually shaping society and drives social change. She's a wonderful writer. I encourage you, if you don't already do, to follow her op-eds in the New York Times, which are a must-read. And today she's here to present her new book, which is just out, Twitter and Tear Gas, the Power and Fragility of Network Protest. Unfortunately, we don't have enough copy here. It's the only one. But please order it. It's available. I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful book. Zeynep, we're so delighted to have you here and to host this first Cambridge Book Talk, right? Thank you. It is. It is. This is my very first book talk. Wow. Wonderful. I am so thrilled. Now, I really apologize. I went to the other building. I'm like, I guess nobody wants to hear. I'll just sit here. Maybe somebody will show up. And then I was rescued by saying, what are you doing here? I said, proving that having a PhD means nothing when it comes to practical stuff. So how should we allocate the question-answer time so I time myself correctly now that I'm a little late? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a little bit of a brief, I guess, overview. I won't go over everything. But I'll try to explain. And then I'll try to draw it out in the question-answer part, because I think that will be much more productive. And what I'm trying to puzzle through here is, what is this new network public sphere that we're all talking about evolving into? And I'm getting at this from the point of view of social movements. But to get from the point of view of social movements, you have to sort of discuss all the other dynamics that are emergent and that are becoming more and more solidified. So just very briefly to situate myself, I'm originally from Turkey. I grew up there. I grew up without the internet. I grew up without access to enough books. I used to have practically every single translated encyclopedia in Turkish, because that was a very finite amount. And my grandmother would buy them for me. So I had every one of them. And I would just reread them. So I grew up in a situation where you'd run out of things to read. And there was heavy censorship. You had one TV channel, and they'd show us Little House on the Prairie. It makes so little sense in the Middle East. I can't even explain how little sense. We don't have a frontier. Like, you dig, and there's like four civilizations and ten empires. So what is this middle of nowhere they're allegedly in? The reason we got that channel and that TV show was because it was after a military coup, which had established very strict controls over the public sphere, which lasted in some ways reverberating to this day. And there was a big conflict in the Kurdish Southeast that, of course, we didn't hear about. And then I, because I was a programmer by profession, I ended up working at IBM early on. And they had a global intranet before anybody in Turkey had internet. So I got a sense of, oh, wait. It was a bizarre project. We were localizing a MIDI system that was programmed on big mainframes that were built before I was born. And I was supposed to work on all the levels. And sometimes I'd have a question. And I'd be asking an IBM's intranet. And it would be someone in Japan would say, oh, yeah, I wrote that. Here's how you do it. I thought, this is amazing. I can't figure out what's going on in my own country. I can talk to someone in Japan who's going to help me, right? IBM's virtual network. So that kind of made me really, that experience in thinking about computers made me really interested in how this was going to change everything. And then internet came to Turkey. And I just jumped on it. And at the time, it was sort of the Taylor and of the Zapatista movement that had captured so much global attention. And they were allegedly using the internet a lot. I emailed people. And I showed up at their encuentros. They were holding these encuentros, bringing together activists together from around the world. And then I've been sort of following, participating, observing, thinking about these movements since then, which I trace from, like, I would trace it from the Zapatistas to the Seattle 99, the WTO protest, to the anti-corporate globalization protest, of the 90s, kind of. And then 9-11 happened, which changed a lot of things. And there was the anti-war movement. And then we had the latest way, which is the Occupy, the whole Arab uprising. And then it's still kind of, you have these different countries. Turkey is a part of protests. Hong Kong. So there's been a lot. If you look numerically, too, the number of protests has tripled or quadrupled, depending on how you measure. I bet if after you put 2017, it's going to be even more difficult. But, so here's one of the motivating puzzles of the book that we'll get to, that I'm trying to sort of get to with this book is, if digital technologies are indeed so empowering in so many ways, right, why are we also seeing authoritarianism on the rise around the world? How does that square with that? And if, especially since the tech world tends to be on the progressive, liberal, libertarian spectrum, so the makers and a lot of the early adopters of these technologies and the creators tend to be on one side of the political spectrum. But the movements, they end up synthesizing around the world. If you look at, you know, you go to Tahrir, lots of open source people there. You know, it's kind of this global thing. So technology confidence isn't the problem. But the movements have this cycle of getting very big and then not having the proportional impact you would expect from a movement with that level of energy showing. So I was trying to figure all of this out. So just, this is the book. And it's not out yet. So sorry, I don't have copies either. I guess it'll be out. So one of the things, I very quickly, I never use the term virtual because digital technologies are pervasive in everything we do. Online, offline, I didn't even find that useful anymore. They're part of social movements because they're part of life. And I think, finally, that debate may well be over. But, of course, the fact that they're part of life, I mean, they're not a separate world, right? They're part of this world. But they do have major impacts on this world. I look at them as one more set of technologies that's altering the space and time as we experience it, right? And this goes back to telegraph. It sort of allows you to talk across distance. Or writing, it allows you to preserve ephemeral thought over time. And space-altering technologies, tools, are very integral to our human culture. This is the latest iteration. It's changing the geography of our world in lots of ways. And computation is also bringing, introducing a new kind of intelligence, which isn't really in this book. So that's sort of just this big, broad thing. I don't talk virtual or not. This is, my data is very multi-level. This is me in Gizy Park protest. I have a helmet on because tear gas canisters aimed at your head are not good for someone in my profession or anyone else. But I also look at big data sets. I also look at other people's scholarship, right? So my book isn't based just on here are my, like, I did a lot of systematic interviews. I've been to, you know, protests in Tahrir. And I've been to all the Arab countries that were occupied here. But my book isn't just about my own primary research. I want it to synthesize. I know a lot of my research, obviously, is there. But I want it to synthesize. And this thing I'm studying, this is, I call this globalization from below, the movements. Because you've always had the powerful globalizing. This is a picture I took in Gizy Park protest in, I don't know, day two, day three. This lady, she's a Roma lady. And they sell flowers to tourists around Taksim. If you've ever been to Taksim Square, which is sort of the central square, they're selling flowers to tourists. And they're selling souvenirs and knickknacks. So the protests hit. And the whole place, of course, is now like, you know, that building, it's not supposed to have all those banners. Like, people just took over and occupied the whole place. And there are clashes. So what happens in two days? They have manufactured the Guy Fawkes masks somehow. And instead of selling flowers, they're selling goggles to protect your eyes from tear gas. In case you're into graffiti, here's your spray paint. And, like, they have sort of anti-tear gas stuff and you see these masks. I'm like, this is the leanest production just-in-time thing I've seen. In two days, they've completely shifted inventory. And then I pick these things up. And everybody knew what to do, right? The masks, the symbols, they're so globally recognized, even in Turkey. And I'm like, where did you get these masks? They're a little weird. If you've seen them elsewhere, they're like a little off. Then I realized they somehow downloaded a 2D picture from the internet and then somehow tinkered and figured out a 3D model from it. But, of course, it's not easy to get the 3D depth exactly right from the 2D picture. So they're a little off. They just somehow, you know, in one day, this is what they could do. So this is amazing to me that there's this global protest culture that is very recognizable with the tear gas and the Guy Fawkes and everybody. It was just for, you go a lot of places. Of course, every country is different, right? Every country is different. But as I traveled around, right, when I first saw, and I went to, you know, Egypt and I'm in Tahrir Square, I'm talking to people. And I'm like, well, okay, so maybe this is Egypt and Egypt has all these sort of peculiarities. And then you see the indignados movement in Spain and it's very horizontal. It's participatory. And it's Spain, you know. You have a tradition of that. Occupy and you're like, okay, it's New York. And you sort of see these similarities and you keep trying to add to the reasons why each one just convergent there. And then I went to Turkey, which never had a leaderless movement of size, right? Never had occupations like this. Doesn't have any of the cultural elements you see in Spain or something, a history of anarchist movements, participatory movements. And I found the movement that was really similar. And that's when I started thinking, you know what? It's really a global convergence. I keep explaining each one of them away. But there is a global pattern here. It doesn't mean there aren't peculiar, specific things to each movement. Of course there are. But there's a lot of globalization from below.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.28, "end": 6.26, "text": " It's a great pleasure to introduce to you Zeynep Tufekci, who's a Berkman faculty
