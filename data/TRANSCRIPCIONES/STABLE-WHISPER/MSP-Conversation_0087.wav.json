{"text": " People, you know, to some extent they are, but, you know, within certain prescribed limits, they're entrepreneurial. Like you can't, you know, if you open up a McDonald's, you can't, you know, paint it green and purple. Right. And so, you know, you're limited within certain things, but you are owning your own business. And the same may be true of the kind of Uber and Lyft and other aspects of the gig economy where you're an entrepreneur within this framework. And that gives you certain opportunities, but also provides certain limits. Right. And at what point, like, will driving for one of these platforms eventually require a membership fee? And like, you know, right, like we're going to go in that direction of like a multi-level marketing thing. Sure. That seems scary. Recruit other drivers. Right. Like, basically, yeah. I mean, I don't know. I'm conflicted, right? Like, I think that. Oh, gosh. Now I'm thinking like, someone is going to do a multi-level marketing. Right. Ride sharing kind of thing. That's actually, that's a great idea. I know. Well, there's a part of me that's like, that's a great idea for a business to get somebody rich. And it's a horrible idea because so many people are going to get screwed by it. Right. I mean, you know, that said, to take it back, like, I think, like, I haven't worked in, you know, like an office job, like where, I guess I've done startups, but I haven't worked in a business where I've done startups. I love the flexibility of working when I want to work. Right. Right. And I think the way, the way, you know, we ran things at TechTurk is like, work kind of fills in everywhere you don't put something else. Right. So make sure you make room for your life. And, you know, you don't necessarily have to be tied to a desk from, you know, this hour to this hour. Right. And I think that that's, the fact that technology is enabling that kind of a lifestyle for more people. I think is amazing. Right. Yeah. But what I do worry is that, you know, at what point is it exploitative? Sure. And that's, and that's the question that always comes up. And that's where it gets into these sort of labor questions and the whole issue of, you know, contractor versus employee. And, and, you know. Right. You know, if you go back, right. I mean, we've only, you know, the idea of like an office job is really something that is, you know, a little more than a century old. Right. Traditionally. Right. And yet nowadays it's seen as so common, but now we're, we're really starting to challenge that. Yeah. And I think that's like, why is it, why is it better to make someone come in every day? Yeah. Rather than just say, Hey, you know what? We're going to give you incentives. And if you, if you want to work, we hope you will want to work. Here's what you get paid. And. Yeah. You, you get to figure out how to run the rest of your life, you know, if you want. Right. Is like, that seems, that seems like, that seems like a great society. Right. Potentially. Right. But it's only a great society if, if you can do it in that way where enough people can actually make a living. Right. So, and that's where the concern comes in. And that's where, you know, labor law and labor protections are things that come up. But I guess then what's, what's the argument that says, you know, okay, so if you can't, if I'm not providing you enough money with which to make a living, right, then why do you continue to do this? There are no other options. But there's, there are, there are, there are plenty of other options. Or, or am I just sitting kind of, it's, it's nice that I can drive Lyft, you know, for fun. And, and I, and I definitely recognize that. And like, it's, it seems like there's opportunity everywhere. Maybe, maybe, maybe I need to kind of, you know, I guess check my privilege. It's, and it's possible. And like, yeah, I mean, we, we're, we're not in a position where, you know, we need, you know, we need to do this to earn a living. Right. And so, you know, I'm sure the perspective of someone who is doing it because they have no other options. Right. Would be very different. But, yeah, I know. I mean, I, you know, I definitely lean towards the side of, you know, I think this is really interesting and really powerful. And, and also, you know, creates the possibility for things that, that really couldn't be done before. And that's always where I think innovation gets the most exciting. Interesting. But that, I mean, you know, basically what we have now with Uber and Lyft is essentially a platform with which you can hire a person to take you from A to B. And I think the fascinating thing that I, that's happening in my mind right now is like, you know, what if, what if I need someone to help me move, you know, this couch? Okay, great. Hopefully I'll, I'll order an Uber or a box called a box that can move my box. What if I want him to help me move it to carry it into my house? Can he just stay on the clock? And it essentially becomes like a flexible way to hire somebody for a certain amount of time. Like turn your car off. This way you're not even driving any miles and putting any miles in your car. Right. Now, do you mind it actually just, you know, helping me move this box or, you know, I just need to stand in line here at the post office. Sure. Park it. I'm going to, you know, pay your meter. Like, is it a platform? Is, you know, is our Uber and Lyft going to eventually, can they become kind of a more flexible way or a platform? Right. Platform for any kind of labor. Right. Which is what TaskRabbit started off as. Right. And, and what I wonder why, you know, I think TaskRabbit hasn't done nearly as well as Uber and Lyft is, you know, they started off almost too broad. Right. Yeah. And even, I mean, even something that goes back like Mechanical Turk on Amazon, right. Which, you know, that was more, you know, it was, it wasn't physical labor so much as to some extent intellectual labor. Right. But, you know, you look at that marketplace and, and the, the issue with that one was that the pricing got driven down so incredibly low. Right. I mean, I think in that case, the supply and demand are just out of whack. Yeah. Right. I love that platform. I struggle to figure out a project that I could use Mechanical Turk for. Right. But, I mean, you might not be the target audience. There are certainly audiences that, that, that make use of Mechanical Turk. Right. But I, but the pricing on that platform tells me that the supply and demand are just out of whack. Yeah. Well, sure. I mean, that's just, but that's because it's competition, right? Yeah. I mean, you could argue, right? I mean, taxi cab, there are cabs who, who use Uber as well as, as a, you know, lead generation. Right. But it's still a lot more competition on the streets. Right. And so that's definitely a concern. And I think, you know, I mean, one of the interesting things is that it's certainly demonstrated, and there have been arguments about this for years about, you know, whether or not we really needed taxi medallions to limit the number of cabs in the street. Right. And taxi lobby said, you know, for safety reasons and all this kind of stuff. Right. I, I think for the most part, there have certainly been an occasional incident with a Uber or a Lyft driver, some of which are. Right. You know, disturbing or horrifying, but, you know, I. But I think for the most part, I mean, the reason why Lyft and Uber are able to do what they do now without, call it a lot of regulation, is because, you know, it's a lot more difficult now to hoodwink somebody. Yeah. And get away with it. Well, that's, you know, and, and that's where. Which is great. It's a whole interesting thing, which is right. I mean, basically, you know, the regulation in many of these areas was really just a way of dealing with the lack of, of information flow. Right. I mean, it's an information asymmetry. You don't know if, if this is a trustworthy. Yeah. And therefore you had regulation, whereas the, the wonderful thing about the internet and certainly mobile today is the fact that you can build up trust infrastructure that takes away some of the need, perhaps not all of it, but some of the need for, for the regular infrastructure. So let me ask one other question about, because, you know, one of the regulatory things that keeps coming up with both Uber and Lyft is this question of like background checks to make sure that you're, you're a safe driver. Sure. And I passed them all. Checking out your car. How does, how does, I mean, what did, I mean, how much did you have to do to get approved on both platforms? I mean, were they different or is it basically the same process? Both of them basically are pretty similar. I would say kind of cursory. They did a background check. And I consented in both cases to a background check. Both cases kind of looked at my car, made sure I had one seatbelt per passenger. That's basically it. They never, never, you know, they assume if you have a driver's license, you are able to drive safely, which, you know, hopefully that's the case. They check your, you know, in that background check, I'm, I'm assuming they're looking for arrests and I'm not sure about traffic violations or whatnot, but I'm, you know, I'm a pretty clean driver. Right. So, I mean, that's, it was pretty, pretty easy for me to get through it. You know, and seeing how many drivers are on the road, I'm guessing that it's, it's actually fairly straightforward. Yeah. Well, I wonder, I mean, and I'm sure Uber and Lyft, you know, have huge data analysis operations and, and I wonder how quickly they believe that they can tell whether or not a driver is good or bad. And I would bet that they can tell pretty quickly. Right. I mean, the, the lower is, you know, once you get to the bottom of it, a few bad ratings and your average goes down, you will get kicked off the platform. Right. You know, thankfully my ratings have been pretty high up until this point. So, and I think that people, you know, drivers definitely are very, very concerned about the rating. Right. And they, they try really hard to get that, the five stars. Yeah. And anything below five stars is a concern when you're a driver. So. Yeah. And I, I mean, I, you know, it's interesting too, because like, you know, I've definitely seen the same sort of thing in, in terms of like using Airbnb, right. Whereas like the experience that I've had from, from hosts where I've stayed at, at their places. Right. You know, they've gone above and beyond in terms of making sure that, that the stay was, was great. And, you know, so now I'll tell people, I mean, people, they talk about, you know, fear of, you know, the dangers of Airbnb, but like my experience in using Airbnb is it's been better than a hotel in almost every way. And same thing with both on both sides. You know, I think, Uber and Lyft, when I'm on a, when I'm a rider, like all of the drivers that for the most part, there's been one or two examples where I think it's been a poor experience, but it like never have I had a cab that's gone out of their way to make the ride as pleasant. Right. As, as like I've, I've gotten on the Lyft and Uber and maybe that's, maybe that's part of novelty and that'll wear off after the platforms become more ubiquitous and the drivers become more jaded. Yeah. But for the most part right now. Experiences are great. And the same with Airbnb. I mean, yeah, come to think of it. I mean, my using Lyft and Uber, like the drivers definitely do seem nicer than just taking a cab. Right. Well, because there's, you know, the cab is not rewarded at all for providing five-star experiences. Right. Whereas Lyft and Uber drivers, like if you, if you go above and beyond, like I'll comment on the driver and say that was amazing and wonderful. And hopefully that goes into some sort of a feedback system. You know, the, the incentives are aligned. And properly. Yeah. That's, that's what I think is, you know, not only is it more convenient, but the incentives are aligned in the right ways on both sides. The drivers are incented to provide really good service. Yeah. And hopefully the riders are actually also incented to be good passengers because we rate you guys as well. Right. Right. So. And so, and so when, and we'll just finish up after this, but you know, when you get, you know, someone is hailing a ride. Right. You see their rating and you can reject it. If you. If you want. But the two things that both platforms kind of watch closely are your response rate, you know, and your rating. So those are the two things that they're really kind of keeping an eye on. And if you, if you decline more than say 10% of the rides that you're assigned, then they'll, they'll start to kind of question whether or not you really need to be on the platform or not. Right. Fascinating data problem, how to match riders and drivers. Yeah. You know, they're getting better. Both platforms are getting better. And, you know, back months ago when I was first driving, I would constantly get hails from, you know, good five, 10, 15 minutes away and going in the wrong direction, downtown San Francisco. Right. Which is, you know, a minefield of one way streets. And now like more consistently, it's, it's like my, the, the, the rider is hailing a ride and it's two blocks ahead of me in the direction in which I'm going. Right. And I'm like, wow, that's, you know, that's, that's pretty good. Which is awesome, right? Like on the other side, as a, as a passenger, you can hail, you can push the button and a car arrives. Like, I think I showed up one, it was 30 seconds. I was there. Oh my goodness. And the guy was like, whoa, whoa. Okay. And that's, that's kind of, that's where we're going. Right. Like this whole concept of, you know, calling a cab, you used to have to call a cab half an hour before you wanted to go anywhere. Or even like, yeah. I mean, or like, I know like taking a cab to the airport in the morning or something, you'd want to call the night before to make sure and then hope that they actually show up. Even so you're hoping, yeah, you're hoping that they go. So, I mean, I think it's an amazing, it's an amazing thing. I mean, living in San Francisco, these, these hailing platforms have definitely changed how I get around the city. Um, but, you know, I'm excited to see, you know, where, where it's all going. And, you know, if, as far as employment is concerned, if we can move the entire population over to kind of a more flexible, enjoyable way of working such that you can work whenever you want, like however much you want. Yeah. Um, it seems like, it seems like a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are legitimate concerns though about, you know, uh, abuse and exploitation in that. Sure. And, and the fact that, you know, monetization in any marketplace applies to kind of downward price pressure. Yep. Um, so, which is, I mean, again though, which is good for consumers, but potentially, you know, right. But Lyft as from the driver's side, Lyft has tipping. Uber does not. Oh, okay. Um, so drivers like the tipping. Yeah, obviously. Right. And I think that that to me seems like a great reason why as a Lyft driver, you would provide not just five star experience, which is what you're aiming for, which is kind of the, you know, the mill, but you would provide above and beyond, right. You would, you would really provide superior. Okay. So. Interesting. All right. Well, um, do you have any sort of final thoughts to wrap this up? I mean, I think you were. Yeah, I think that was, I mean, that was my, that was my final thought. Um, you know, I'm going to continue to drive both Lyft and Uber on a, on a, on just like casual basis to kind of see the development of the platform. Do you use them both at one time or? Uh, no, no, I don't. Um, that's too confusing for me. Right. And then I have to, you have to change your trade dress is what they call it. The little sticker they put in the window. Oh, really? It's called trade dress. Yeah. And the, the law or the, what the rules are, you have to have that in your window. Oh, okay. So, you know, that, that would, I know people do both platforms at the same time to kind of maximize utilization. Yeah. But as far as, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I, it seems whenever I drive, I'm, I'm fully utilized. So there's no need to. Right. Um, and I'm not going to chase surge. Right. Or a prime time as Lyft is called. Um, so. But it's, it's great. And it's, you know, definitely had some interesting conversations. I've, the one thing I've definitely learned is, you know, even though I've been living here for 18 years, I don't know how to get around the San Francisco nearly as well as I thought I did.",

entrepreneurial. Like you can't, you know, if you open up a McDonald's, you can't, you know, paint it green and purple. Right. And so, you know, you're limited within certain things, but you are owning your own business. And the same may be true of the kind of Uber and Lyft and other aspects of the gig economy where you're an entrepreneur within this framework. And that gives you certain opportunities, but also provides certain limits. Right. And at what point, like, will driving for one of these platforms eventually require a membership fee? And like, you know, right, like we're going to go in that direction of like a multi-level marketing thing. Sure. That seems scary. Recruit other drivers. Right. Like, basically, yeah. I mean, I don't know. I'm conflicted, right? Like, I think that. Oh, gosh. Now I'm thinking like, someone is going to do a multi-level marketing. Right. Ride sharing kind of thing. That's actually, that's a great idea. I know. Well, there's a part of me that's like, that's a great idea for a business to get somebody rich. And it's a horrible idea because so many people are going to get screwed by it. Right. I mean, you know, that said, to take it back, like, I think, like, I haven't worked in, you know, like an office job, like where, I guess I've done startups, but I haven't worked in a business where I've done startups. I love the flexibility of working when I want to work. Right. Right. And I think the way, the way, you know, we ran things at TechTurk is like, work kind of fills in everywhere you don't put something else. Right. So make sure you make room for your life. And, you know, you don't necessarily have to be tied to a desk from, you know, this hour to this hour. Right. And I think that that's, the fact that technology is enabling that kind of a lifestyle for more people. I think is amazing. Right. Yeah. But what I do worry is that, you know, at what point is it exploitative? Sure. And that's, and that's the question that always comes up. And that's where it gets into these sort of labor questions and the whole issue of, you know, contractor versus employee. And, and, you know. Right. You know, if you go back, right. I mean, we've only, you know, the idea of like an office job is really something that is, you know, a little more than a century old. Right. Traditionally. Right. And yet nowadays it's seen as so common, but now we're, we're really starting to challenge that. Yeah. And I think that's like, why is it, why is it better to make someone come in every day? Yeah. Rather than just say, Hey, you know what? We're going to give you incentives. And if you, if you want to work, we hope you will want to work. Here's what you get paid. And. Yeah. You, you get to figure out how to run the rest of your life, you know, if you want. Right. Is like, that seems, that seems like, that seems like a great society. Right. Potentially. Right. But it's only a great society if, if you can do it in that way where enough people can actually make a living. Right. So, and that's where the concern comes in. And that's where, you know, labor law and labor protections are things that come up. But I guess then what's, what's the argument that says, you know, okay, so if you can't, if I'm not providing you enough money with which to make a living, right, then why do you continue to do this? There are no other options. But there's, there are, there are, there are plenty of other options. Or, or am I just sitting kind of, it's, it's nice that I can drive Lyft, you know, for fun. And, and I, and I definitely recognize that. And like, it's, it seems like there's opportunity everywhere. Maybe, maybe, maybe I need to kind of, you know, I guess check my privilege. It's, and it's possible. And like, yeah, I mean, we, we're, we're not in a position where, you know, we need, you know, we need to do this to earn a living. Right. And so, you know, I'm sure the perspective of someone who is doing it because they have no other options. Right. Would be very different. But, yeah, I know. I mean, I, you know, I definitely lean towards the side of, you know, I think this is really interesting and really powerful. And, and also, you know, creates the possibility for things that, that really couldn't be done before. And that's always where I think innovation gets the most exciting. Interesting. But that, I mean, you know, basically what we have now with Uber and Lyft is essentially a platform with which you can hire a person to take you from A to B. And I think the fascinating thing that I, that's happening in my mind right now is like, you know, what if, what if I need someone to help me move, you know, this couch? Okay, great. Hopefully I'll, I'll order an Uber or a box called a box that can move my box. What if I want him to help me move it to carry it into my house? Can he just stay on the clock? And it essentially becomes like a flexible way to hire somebody for a certain amount of time. Like turn your car off. This way you're not even driving any miles and putting any miles in your car. Right. Now, do you mind it actually just, you know, helping me move this box or, you know, I just need to stand in line here at the post office. Sure. Park it. I'm going to, you know, pay your meter. Like, is it a platform? Is, you know, is our Uber and Lyft going to eventually, can they become kind of a more flexible way or a platform? Right. Platform for any kind of labor. Right. Which is what TaskRabbit started off as. Right. And, and what I wonder why, you know, I think TaskRabbit hasn't done nearly as well as Uber and Lyft is, you know, they started off almost too broad. Right. Yeah. And even, I mean, even something that goes back like Mechanical Turk on Amazon, right. Which, you know, that was more, you know, it was, it wasn't physical labor so much as to some extent intellectual labor. Right. But, you know, you look at that marketplace and, and the, the issue with that one was that the pricing got driven down so incredibly low. Right. I mean, I think in that case, the supply and demand are just out of whack. Yeah. Right. I love that platform. I struggle to figure out a project that I could use Mechanical Turk for. Right. But, I mean, you might not be the target audience. There are certainly audiences that, that, that make use of Mechanical Turk. Right. But I, but the pricing on that platform tells me that the supply and demand are just out of whack. Yeah. Well, sure. I mean, that's just, but that's because it's competition, right? Yeah. I mean, you could argue, right? I mean, taxi cab, there are cabs who, who use Uber as well as, as a, you know, lead generation. Right. But it's still a lot more competition on the streets. Right. And so that's definitely a concern. And I think, you know, I mean, one of the interesting things is that it's certainly demonstrated, and there have been arguments about this for years about, you know, whether or not we really needed taxi medallions to limit the number of cabs in the street. Right. And taxi lobby said, you know, for safety reasons and all this kind of stuff. Right. I, I think for the most part, there have certainly been an occasional incident with a Uber or a Lyft driver, some of which are. Right. You know, disturbing or horrifying, but, you know, I. But I think for the most part, I mean, the reason why Lyft and Uber are able to do what they do now without, call it a lot of regulation, is because, you know, it's a lot more difficult now to hoodwink somebody. Yeah. And get away with it. Well, that's, you know, and, and that's where. Which is great. It's a whole interesting thing, which is right. I mean, basically, you know, the regulation in many of these areas was really just a way of dealing with the lack of, of information flow. Right. I mean, it's an information asymmetry. You don't know if, if this is a trustworthy. Yeah. And therefore you had regulation, whereas the, the wonderful thing about the internet and certainly mobile today is the fact that you can build up trust infrastructure that takes away some of the need, perhaps not all of it, but some of the need for, for the regular infrastructure. So let me ask one other question about, because, you know, one of the regulatory things that keeps coming up with both Uber and Lyft is this question of like background checks to make sure that you're, you're a safe driver. Sure. And I passed them all. Checking out your car. How does, how does, I mean, what did, I mean, how much did you have to do to get approved on both platforms? I mean, were they different or is it basically the same process? Both of them basically are pretty similar. I would say kind of cursory. They did a background check. And I consented in both cases to a background check. Both cases kind of looked at my car, made sure I had one seatbelt per passenger. That's basically it. They never, never, you know, they assume if you have a driver's license, you are able to drive safely, which, you know, hopefully that's the case. They check your, you know, in that background check, I'm, I'm assuming they're looking for arrests and I'm not sure about traffic violations or whatnot, but I'm, you know, I'm a pretty clean driver. Right. So, I mean, that's, it was pretty, pretty easy for me to get through it. You know, and seeing how many drivers are on the road, I'm guessing that it's, it's actually fairly straightforward. Yeah. Well, I wonder, I mean, and I'm sure Uber and Lyft, you know, have huge data analysis operations and, and I wonder how quickly they believe that they can tell whether or not a driver is good or bad. And I would bet that they can tell pretty quickly. Right. I mean, the, the lower is, you know, once you get to the bottom of it, a few bad ratings and your average goes down, you will get kicked off the platform. Right. You know, thankfully my ratings have been pretty high up until this point. So, and I think that people, you know, drivers definitely are very, very concerned about the rating. Right. And they, they try really hard to get that, the five stars. Yeah. And anything below five stars is a concern when you're a driver. So. Yeah. And I, I mean, I, you know, it's interesting too, because like, you know, I've definitely seen the same sort of thing in, in terms of like using Airbnb, right. Whereas like the experience that I've had from, from hosts where I've stayed at, at their places. Right. You know, they've gone above and beyond in terms of making sure that, that the stay was, was great. And, you know, so now I'll tell people, I mean, people, they talk about, you know, fear of, you know, the dangers of Airbnb, but like my experience in using Airbnb is it's been better than a hotel in almost every way. And same thing with both on both sides. You know, I think, Uber and Lyft, when I'm on a, when I'm a rider, like all of the drivers that for the most part, there's been one or two examples where I think it's been a poor experience, but it like never have I had a cab that's gone out of their way to make the ride as pleasant. Right. As, as like I've, I've gotten on the Lyft and Uber and maybe that's, maybe that's part of novelty and that'll wear off after the platforms become more ubiquitous and the drivers become more jaded. Yeah. But for the most part right now. Experiences are great. And the same with Airbnb. I mean, yeah, come to think of it. I mean, my using Lyft and Uber, like the drivers definitely do seem nicer than just taking a cab. Right. Well, because there's, you know, the cab is not rewarded at all for providing five-star experiences. Right. Whereas Lyft and Uber drivers, like if you, if you go above and beyond, like I'll comment on the driver and say that was amazing and wonderful. And hopefully that goes into some sort of a feedback system. You know, the, the incentives are aligned. And properly. Yeah. That's, that's what I think is, you know, not only is it more convenient, but the incentives are aligned in the right ways on both sides. The drivers are incented to provide really good service. Yeah. And hopefully the riders are actually also incented to be good passengers because we rate you guys as well. Right. Right. So. And so, and so when, and we'll just finish up after this, but you know, when you get, you know, someone is hailing a ride. Right. You see their rating and you can reject it. If you. If you want. But the two things that both platforms kind of watch closely are your response rate, you know, and your rating. So those are the two things that they're really kind of keeping an eye on. And if you, if you decline more than say 10% of the rides that you're assigned, then they'll, they'll start to kind of question whether or not you really need to be on the platform or not. Right. Fascinating data problem, how to match riders and drivers. Yeah. You know, they're getting better. Both platforms are getting better. And, you know, back months ago when I was first driving, I would constantly get hails from, you know, good five, 10, 15 minutes away and going in the wrong direction, downtown San Francisco. Right. Which is, you know, a minefield of one way streets. And now like more consistently, it's, it's like my, the, the, the rider is hailing a ride and it's two blocks ahead of me in the direction in which I'm going. Right. And I'm like, wow, that's, you know, that's, that's pretty good. Which is awesome, right? Like on the other side, as a, as a passenger, you can hail, you can push the button and a car arrives. Like, I think I showed up one, it was 30 seconds. I was there. Oh my goodness. And the guy was like, whoa, whoa. Okay. And that's, that's kind of, that's where we're going. Right. Like this whole concept of, you know, calling a cab, you used to have to call a cab half an hour before you wanted to go anywhere. Or even like, yeah. I mean, or like, I know like taking a cab to the airport in the morning or something, you'd want to call the night before to make sure and then hope that they actually show up. Even so you're hoping, yeah, you're hoping that they go. So, I mean, I think it's an amazing, it's an amazing thing. I mean, living in San Francisco, these, these hailing platforms have definitely changed how I get around the city. Um, but, you know, I'm excited to see, you know, where, where it's all going. And, you know, if, as far as employment is concerned, if we can move the entire population over to kind of a more flexible, enjoyable way of working such that you can work whenever you want, like however much you want. Yeah. Um, it seems like, it seems like a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are legitimate concerns though about, you know, uh, abuse and exploitation in that. Sure. And, and the fact that, you know, monetization in any marketplace applies to kind of downward price pressure. Yep. Um, so, which is, I mean, again though, which is good for consumers, but potentially, you know, right. But Lyft as from the driver's side, Lyft has tipping. Uber does not. Oh, okay. Um, so drivers like the tipping. Yeah, obviously. Right. And I think that that to me seems like a great reason why as a Lyft driver, you would provide not just five star experience, which is what you're aiming for, which is kind of the, you know, the mill, but you would provide above and beyond, right. You would, you would really provide superior. Okay. So. Interesting. All right. Well, um, do you have any sort of final thoughts to wrap this up? I mean, I think you were. Yeah, I think that was, I mean, that was my, that was my final thought. Um, you know, I'm going to continue to drive both Lyft and Uber on a, on a, on just like casual basis to kind of see the development of the platform. Do you use them both at one time or? Uh, no, no, I don't. Um, that's too confusing for me. Right. And then I have to, you have to change your trade dress is what they call it. The little sticker they put in the window. Oh, really? It's called trade dress. Yeah. And the, the law or the, what the rules are, you have to have that in your window. Oh, okay. So, you know, that, that would, I know people do both platforms at the same time to kind of maximize utilization. Yeah. But as far as, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I, it seems whenever I drive, I'm, I'm fully utilized. So there's no need to. Right. Um, and I'm not going to chase surge. Right. Or a prime time as Lyft is called. Um, so. But it's, it's great. And it's, you know, definitely had some interesting conversations. I've, the one thing I've definitely learned is, you know, even though I've been living here for 18 years, I don't know how to get around the San Francisco nearly as well as I thought I did.",
