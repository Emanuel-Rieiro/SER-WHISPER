{"text": " What is happening with this technology is astonishingly deep. For some of the companies in this room, it is a bit scary. Banking has never been the most innovative sector in the world. There is a very careful balance between innovation and the conservative fiduciary duty that exists in banking, that must exist when you control other people's money. Yet with Bitcoin, you don't control other people's money. In Bitcoin, I control my money. I have complete and total authority over my Bitcoin. It cannot be seized, frozen, censored, intercepted, and stopped. I can do so with almost complete anonymity. So can anyone, five minutes after they download an application, and money has changed forever. Banking has changed forever. The idea that you can proceed in the industry of money, in the industries of commerce, and maintain the same conservative attitude that has existed now for centuries, ever since merchants in Venice and Amsterdam started issuing depository certificates and providing banking services, that is gone. That is gone. You cannot operate closed systems that have borders and require permission to join at a rate of innovation that is controlled by the most conservative tendencies within your organization. Now you are competing with a technology that enables exponential growth and innovation at the edges, without permission, by anyone in the world. It is not about anyone in this room. Why? We represent the privileged elite. We are the privileged elite. We can operate online and be trading on the Tokyo stock market within 12 hours in yen. That is the privilege that I have. One and a half billion people have that privilege. Six billion people can operate mainly in one currency and perhaps have some basic banking services. Four billion people are significantly underbanked. An astonishing two and a half billion people are completely unbanked. They will leapfrog. They will never have a relationship with a bank. Every single child born today will never have a bank account. They will have a bank app. A bank app that doesn't give them an account. A bank app that makes them a banker. An international banker in an app. They will not be permitted to open a bank account until they are sixteen years old. By that time, I hope they will have at least six or more years of experience with digital currencies. I would like to watch them walk into a bank branch and have someone explain to them what three to five business days means. It is highly likely that children born today will never get a driving license, because they will have self-driving cars. They will also never use paper money, because by the time they get to an age where they really start using money, there is no paper money. It will seem as anachronistic as a fax machine or horse and buggy to us. They have enormous need, and this system offers them a solution. It is not ready yet. It is nascent. It is complex. It is impossible to use for most people. In 1989, I sent my first email. In order to do so, I had to compile a version of the Unix mail program using a C compiler and Unix command line skills. I had to set it up on the command line, type out my email, and that email was transmitted across the great internet in an astonishing three days. Exactly twenty years later, my mother replicated that experience with a swipe. Bitcoin today and all of the currencies that are built on that recipe are just at the same level that the internet was in 1991. Only now, we have the internet. The rate of exponential growth has already started. The innovation is growing at an astonishing rate. I spend every single day, full-time, trying to keep up with Bitcoin. Just one currency, and it is almost impossible. Do not underestimate this. Do not listen to the people who tell you that Bitcoin is just for... pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, and gamblers. Remember that they said the exact same thing about the internet. When you give it to two or three billion people, they are not interested in those things. They are interested in cat videos. Now we have an internet of a billion cat videos. When you take digital currency mainstream and give it to the four billion people who have been isolated... from international finance and commerce, and you give them the opportunity to control their money... against despotic governments and corrupt banks that are stealing from them, you give them the opportunity to control their future, to transact with everyone in the world, to own title on their own property in a fully transferable digital token that is recognized everywhere, control over finance that cannot be seized, frozen, or censored, they will buy food, health care, sanitation, education. Shelter. Because that is what we do. They will not be denied this technology. Do not underestimate where this is going. The internet of money was launched on January 3rd, 2009. It is coming. It is coming faster than you can imagine. It is deeper than you can fathom. It is more sophisticated than you can immediately understand. It takes years of study just to see all of the implications. It is a gift to the entire world, a technology that represents the sixth greatest innovation in the technology of money, the most ancient technology of our civilization. Thank you. Should we do some questions? We've got plenty of time for questions. Christian. What determines the buying power of the currency? How does it stabilize and what's required to stabilize it? If I would buy some bitcoins, who can manipulate the value of that? Everyone. The buying power of bitcoin is determined in exactly the same way that the buying power of the euro, the British sterling, the Japanese yen, or the US dollar is determined through market forces of supply and demand in international liquid markets that operate around the clock. One of the fundamental differences is that bitcoin trading never ceases. It has been going continuously for seven years. The network never stops. Every ten minutes, bitcoin's heart beats. Transactions are processed. The exchanges never close. There is no closing price for bitcoin. It is a rolling average. In that trading, a market capitalization of approximately $12 billion is now traded internationally. What is $12 billion for a global currency? It's a guppy swimming in shark-infested waters. Every trader, every whale goes in there and just kicks that price around. Right now, the experience of living on bitcoin, which I have been doing full-time for more than three years, is a rollercoaster. It's an absolute rollercoaster. I've seen shifts of 20 or 30 percent in a day. Yet, if you look at the long-term trend, volume goes up, transactions go up, and volatility keeps dropping. I can't sell that to an American. I can't sell that to a Brit. I don't need to sell it to an Argentinian. I don't need to sell it to a Brazilian. I don't need to sell it to a Venezuelan. I went to a conference, and an Argentinian told me, I'm not worried about volatility. Our currency has volatility like this. Bitcoin has volatility like this. I'd rather be going in that direction. You don't need to tell them why. Their government threw people out of airplanes not more than 35 years ago for disagreeing. They already know why the separation of state and money is a good idea. Volatility is relative. Any other questions? Come on. Yeah. Let's get a microphone to you. One second. Okay, so only one short... Sorry. Where are we? There you are. Sorry. Thanks. Great speech. Obviously, it sounded a little bit like one side of the coin. So we also read all these big hacks, and I don't know, Bitfinex, I think they stole 40% of the money. I think also this autonomous organization have been hacked, and all these things. Can you just reflect a little bit on the dark side of those aspects that might not win our full trust into this evolution? Absolutely. I think this was invented 30 years after the automobile was introduced. Why? Because the first automobiles had two leather straps that you pulled, left or right, to move the car, to steer the car. They used horse reins to steer cars. That's called skeuomorphic design. It means keeping a shadow of the former past in your new system, failing to see the new dimension, and replicating the past. Here's a currency that is not centralized, where your money is your money. Your keys, your money. Not your keys, not your money. So what is the first thing we do with this new system? We build centralized institutionals of custodial control, that take other people's money and hold it for them. Well, guess what? The entire history of banking, the entire system of regulation and oversight, is based on the simple centuries-old understanding that when somebody else holds your money, chances are they're going to run away with it. The entire system of regulation is designed to prevent that, and yet it still happens all the time. In national currencies, all the time. And so, of course, if you replicate custodial accounts, exchanges that take other people's Bitcoin and concentrate it, it happens again. Even worse, because there are no oversights and regulations in most of these spaces. The answer is really simple. Stop centralizing the decentralized currency. Stop trying to replicate the banking past in the future of money. The important thing to realize is that security in Bitcoin is an emergent property that exists because of the decentralization of control and power. If I want to hack a million customers' Bitcoin, and they're holding their keys, I have to hack a million customers. If they all give their keys to one person or one organization, then we've got a honeypot. A honeypot that attracts the attention of every hacker on the planet. And notice what's happened. Over seven years, and with a market capitalization of $12 billion, Bitcoin is the largest cryptographic deployment in the world. It is the largest public key infrastructure in the world. It is the largest security honeypot in the world. It is not secure because it doesn't get attacked. It is secure because it generates immunity by being attacked all the time. Twenty-four hours a day by the most sophisticated attackers this planet has. If you, in that environment, set up a centralized custodial exchange using PHP and MySQL, and you park a $150 million honeypot in there, you're inviting the sharks.", "segments": [{"start": 0.04,

For some of the companies in this room, it is a bit scary. Banking has never been the most innovative sector in the world. There is a very careful balance between innovation and the conservative fiduciary duty that exists in banking, that must exist when you control other people's money. Yet with Bitcoin, you don't control other people's money. In Bitcoin, I control my money. I have complete and total authority over my Bitcoin. It cannot be seized, frozen, censored, intercepted, and stopped. I can do so with almost complete anonymity. So can anyone, five minutes after they download an application, and money has changed forever. Banking has changed forever. The idea that you can proceed in the industry of money, in the industries of commerce, and maintain the same conservative attitude that has existed now for centuries, ever since merchants in Venice and Amsterdam started issuing depository certificates and providing banking services, that is gone. That is gone. You cannot operate closed systems that have borders and require permission to join at a rate of innovation that is controlled by the most conservative tendencies within your organization. Now you are competing with a technology that enables exponential growth and innovation at the edges, without permission, by anyone in the world. It is not about anyone in this room. Why? We represent the privileged elite. We are the privileged elite. We can operate online and be trading on the Tokyo stock market within 12 hours in yen. That is the privilege that I have. One and a half billion people have that privilege. Six billion people can operate mainly in one currency and perhaps have some basic banking services. Four billion people are significantly underbanked. An astonishing two and a half billion people are completely unbanked. They will leapfrog. They will never have a relationship with a bank. Every single child born today will never have a bank account. They will have a bank app. A bank app that doesn't give them an account. A bank app that makes them a banker. An international banker in an app. They will not be permitted to open a bank account until they are sixteen years old. By that time, I hope they will have at least six or more years of experience with digital currencies. I would like to watch them walk into a bank branch and have someone explain to them what three to five business days means. It is highly likely that children born today will never get a driving license, because they will have self-driving cars. They will also never use paper money, because by the time they get to an age where they really start using money, there is no paper money. It will seem as anachronistic as a fax machine or horse and buggy to us. They have enormous need, and this system offers them a solution. It is not ready yet. It is nascent. It is complex. It is impossible to use for most people. In 1989, I sent my first email. In order to do so, I had to compile a version of the Unix mail program using a C compiler and Unix command line skills. I had to set it up on the command line, type out my email, and that email was transmitted across the great internet in an astonishing three days. Exactly twenty years later, my mother replicated that experience with a swipe. Bitcoin today and all of the currencies that are built on that recipe are just at the same level that the internet was in 1991. Only now, we have the internet. The rate of exponential growth has already started. The innovation is growing at an astonishing rate. I spend every single day, full-time, trying to keep up with Bitcoin. Just one currency, and it is almost impossible. Do not underestimate this. Do not listen to the people who tell you that Bitcoin is just for... pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, and gamblers. Remember that they said the exact same thing about the internet. When you give it to two or three billion people, they are not interested in those things. They are interested in cat videos. Now we have an internet of a billion cat videos. When you take digital currency mainstream and give it to the four billion people who have been isolated... from international finance and commerce, and you give them the opportunity to control their money... against despotic governments and corrupt banks that are stealing from them, you give them the opportunity to control their future, to transact with everyone in the world, to own title on their own property in a fully transferable digital token that is recognized everywhere, control over finance that cannot be seized, frozen, or censored, they will buy food, health care, sanitation, education. Shelter. Because that is what we do. They will not be denied this technology. Do not underestimate where this is going. The internet of money was launched on January 3rd, 2009. It is coming. It is coming faster than you can imagine. It is deeper than you can fathom. It is more sophisticated than you can immediately understand. It takes years of study just to see all of the implications. It is a gift to the entire world, a technology that represents the sixth greatest innovation in the technology of money, the most ancient technology of our civilization. Thank you. Should we do some questions? We've got plenty of time for questions. Christian. What determines the buying power of the currency? How does it stabilize and what's required to stabilize it? If I would buy some bitcoins, who can manipulate the value of that? Everyone. The buying power of bitcoin is determined in exactly the same way that the buying power of the euro, the British sterling, the Japanese yen, or the US dollar is determined through market forces of supply and demand in international liquid markets that operate around the clock. One of the fundamental differences is that bitcoin trading never ceases. It has been going continuously for seven years. The network never stops. Every ten minutes, bitcoin's heart beats. Transactions are processed. The exchanges never close. There is no closing price for bitcoin. It is a rolling average. In that trading, a market capitalization of approximately $12 billion is now traded internationally. What is $12 billion for a global currency? It's a guppy swimming in shark-infested waters. Every trader, every whale goes in there and just kicks that price around. Right now, the experience of living on bitcoin, which I have been doing full-time for more than three years, is a rollercoaster. It's an absolute rollercoaster. I've seen shifts of 20 or 30 percent in a day. Yet, if you look at the long-term trend, volume goes up, transactions go up, and volatility keeps dropping. I can't sell that to an American. I can't sell that to a Brit. I don't need to sell it to an Argentinian. I don't need to sell it to a Brazilian. I don't need to sell it to a Venezuelan. I went to a conference, and an Argentinian told me, I'm not worried about volatility. Our currency has volatility like this. Bitcoin has volatility like this. I'd rather be going in that direction. You don't need to tell them why. Their government threw people out of airplanes not more than 35 years ago for disagreeing. They already know why the separation of state and money is a good idea. Volatility is relative. Any other questions? Come on. Yeah. Let's get a microphone to you. One second. Okay, so only one short... Sorry. Where are we? There you are. Sorry. Thanks. Great speech. Obviously, it sounded a little bit like one side of the coin. So we also read all these big hacks, and I don't know, Bitfinex, I think they stole 40% of the money. I think also this autonomous organization have been hacked, and all these things. Can you just reflect a little bit on the dark side of those aspects that might not win our full trust into this evolution? Absolutely. I think this was invented 30 years after the automobile was introduced. Why? Because the first automobiles had two leather straps that you pulled, left or right, to move the car, to steer the car. They used horse reins to steer cars. That's called skeuomorphic design. It means keeping a shadow of the former past in your new system, failing to see the new dimension, and replicating the past. Here's a currency that is not centralized, where your money is your money. Your keys, your money. Not your keys, not your money. So what is the first thing we do with this new system? We build centralized institutionals of custodial control, that take other people's money and hold it for them. Well, guess what? The entire history of banking, the entire system of regulation and oversight, is based on the simple centuries-old understanding that when somebody else holds your money, chances are they're going to run away with it. The entire system of regulation is designed to prevent that, and yet it still happens all the time. In national currencies, all the time. And so, of course, if you replicate custodial accounts, exchanges that take other people's Bitcoin and concentrate it, it happens again. Even worse, because there are no oversights and regulations in most of these spaces. The answer is really simple. Stop centralizing the decentralized currency. Stop trying to replicate the banking past in the future of money. The important thing to realize is that security in Bitcoin is an emergent property that exists because of the decentralization of control and power. If I want to hack a million customers' Bitcoin, and they're holding their keys, I have to hack a million customers. If they all give their keys to one person or one organization, then we've got a honeypot. A honeypot that attracts the attention of every hacker on the planet. And notice what's happened. Over seven years, and with a market capitalization of $12 billion, Bitcoin is the largest cryptographic deployment in the world. It is the largest public key infrastructure in the world. It is the largest security honeypot in the world. It is not secure because it doesn't get attacked. It is secure because it generates immunity by being attacked all the time. Twenty-four hours a day by the most sophisticated attackers this planet has. If you, in that environment, set up a centralized custodial exchange using PHP and MySQL, and you park a $150 million honeypot in there, you're inviting the sharks.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start":
