{"text": " I'm going to be talking with Panashi Chigumadze after an article that came out on smart women being hot babes. And I asked the question, why does it still hurt smart women to be seen as hot? I thought this was something that was cured. Here's a whole lot of really young South African women talking about how they had to, if you like, to consider what it meant to be serious, to try and look older to be serious. And I thought that was quite sad that we weren't able to be real. Jackie via Facebook says, great. She says, I'm a hot babe, Lindsay. I have a malfunctioning hermitage and I shop at pep stores. No chance of someone wearing the same outfit as me. No chance of someone's even setting foot in pep stores. She says, I'm serious, not a chance. So she's taking a bit of humor in terms of on smart woman being hot babes. And I suppose there's always a pressure if you're smart and if you're gorgeous, that people, if you're gorgeous, will think that you are a fifi and not take you very serious, which is certainly something that is frustrating for women who are trying to make a place in South Africa. This sense of having to dumb down and act pretty rather than smart and almost as if people spend more time on the image and the issue of surgeries and diets than looking at the power of what it means to be smart. You know, we hear about young people pretending not to be clever so that they're not singled out. I was saddened that still it's 2015 and there's some young woman feeling this pressure. So my question also is, where does the pressure come from? You know, if there is pressure to look serious, where does it come from? Who puts the pressure on us? And at what point do we buy into that pressure? So this article was by Simankele Dlakavu. And now listen to me, I'm getting stuck. Dlakavu. But the person I'm going to be talking to this morning, her name is Panashi. She comes from Ilova. And she is the editor and founder of Vanguard magazine. And she was interviewed as part of this interview. She was one of several women interviewed as part of the interview by Simankele. And on the issue of smart women being hot babes. Panashi, hi, good morning to you. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for being on air. The bit you might not have heard because you were on with Amy that I was talking about is how sad I was that here are all young women feeling still a pressure to try and look serious. Of course. I mean, we still live in a patriarchal society. So we are not going to be shielded from that. So as long as, you know, those relations haven't changed, then it makes sense that we will continue to fight or have to fight that kind of battle. And for our daughters and our granddaughters until, you know, we've ridded ourselves of, you know, that form of patriarchy that also has a very racial term as well. You know, in the article, you said that, you know, that, that, you know, you felt that there was this pressure to look serious and have this polished look. And you and you said it's not a neutral thing. No, of course not. So often, you know, for example, we'll speak about having a polished look and, you know, that you shouldn't have an exotic look. And often by exotic, it means, you know, no efforts, you know, unrelaxed hair, no dreadlocks, you know, that kind of thing is going to be sanctioned. So it means that, you know, in order for my hair to look polished, it means often that my hair must be relaxed. And you also see this in schools as well, where you'll find in school codes of conduct that they will say, you know, no exotic hairstyle such as efforts, which is, you know, natural hair. Exactly as it comes out of my head. So it's definitely not neutral because, you know, it excludes many black women in particular based on, you know, what is natural to us. I suppose, you know, I sense a frustration. I remember many years ago, I was doing a training and the lady who was coming to assess the whole process, assess the person who was doing the training, had a good chat with me. And she says, I wished I could be as free as you were in terms of your look. And she says, I wished I could wear dreadlocks at the Department of Labor. And I was, I was floored. And I said, why can't you? You know, and I realized that part of that was probably where I came from my white middle class privilege, where I never had a sense of, it was okay for me to be smart and look however I wanted because I never needed to prove anything, if you like. Exactly. I mean, even if it's not something that is in a code of conduct, you know, that it explicitly says, do not have this kind of look. It's definitely not something that is generally looked upon with any sort of positive sound. So generally, you know, it's the kind of thing that maybe someone who, you know, has some sort of empathy for you and your career might pull you aside and say, you know, maybe you might want to change your hairstyle. And it definitely is coming from, it is a privilege to be able to be who you are because, you know, and it goes through just generally what particularly the experience of black people, black women in corporate South Africa is having to constantly prove yourself. And part of that proving yourself is an alienation of self. So definitely there's very much a patriarchal and a racial tone to, or sense to how it is that we have to be. We have to show up in the workplace. But now I've got an important question for you. The workplace is not, is changing. And oftentimes, yes, I understand the context in which you are, but the shape and size of corporate places is changing. My question is, where does that come, where does the pressure come from? And who is pushing the, putting the pressure there? And how much are women to blame? You know, when you're called aside, is it a woman who's calling you aside? In other words, is it not our perception of what is okay? In other words, I have a concern when I see a department that, for example, is women and it's still happening. That I don't get. You know, I really hate to victim blame. At the end of the day, it is even if, you know, first of all, patriarchy doesn't need, um, women to, or it doesn't need men to perpetuate. It's, um, racism or rather white supremacy doesn't need white people to perpetuate it. Right. Because, you know, if this is, those are the constraints with which you work. Um, these people have learned that this is the best way in which you can survive. And honestly, it actually can be seen as someone doing you a favor because they've understood that these are the rules. These are the ways in which you can survive corporate better. So it's better for me to help you by doing what it is that will help you succeed within that. So if you don't deconstruct that system, it doesn't matter whether it's women or men or black people, white people doing it. At the end of the day, it still serves the same system. So it's not surprising that women will do that because they bear the brunt of it. So women can be just as patriarchal. Black people can be just as white supremacists because they've learned the ways in which, or the codes for which, um, you need to succeed in the current socioeconomic system in South Africa. But, you know, before I was talking to you, I was, I was talking about the issue of, aren't we the ones, you know, we can always blame other people and blame the government, but, you know, we are the government. And in this case, can it not change by the people? Can the people not in the system change it? I mean, I was shocked. I mean, I understand in a corporate environment, but I was shocked in the article, um, when Chimamanda, um, Arichi says, you know, as a 26 year old, she, she hid her high heels, but it wasn't in a corporate setting. She was, she was an author and she felt, she, she felt that she wanted to be taken seriously as an author. And so she hid her high heels. She, she felt that orange, uh, which happened to flatter her, her skin tone was too loud. Her earrings were too low. I mean that, that, you know, everything she felt she should wear was uninteresting, too bright, too fitted and too unusual. And that for me is shocking. Um, and it almost seems to me that women have to be successful in order to say, no, this is, this is, this is, this is ridiculous. Not what I have to do. Um, look again, it's not, it doesn't come out of nowhere. I mean, it was funny because just before, um, just preparing for this interview, um, my boyfriend decided to just quickly Google the article and that's what Mom Gilly wrote and, you know, smart women, hot babes. And what came out of it was a whole range of very sexist articles about hot, smart women or, you know, ranking the hottest, um, smart woman, um, and all kinds of things. And you see so many times when a woman who has, you know, a role that has nothing to do with her looks is, um, completely shamed for the way in which she dresses, whether it's been your Hillary Clinton or your Jim Marcus, as this happens all the time. Um, so it's not surprising. It's responding to the social cues that are out there that, you know, if you look a certain way, you know, it must be, you know, mutually exclusive that, you know, beauty and brains don't go together. We always hear that or see that. Um, and it, it is unfortunate that it does take some level of success or having no, less of a sense of wanting to prove yourself. Um, you know, for example, and I say this in the article that when I first started out in corporate South Africa, I had to do very much of the growing up in terms of my look, um, that Chimamanda did, particularly being a young black woman. I had to do some, much more to ensure that people took me seriously. And the way in which I looked wasn't a factor, um, in what I did. So it's responding to very real conditions. I think I understand what you're saying in terms of saying we need to have a sense of agency. Um, so I think the importance is understanding what are the constraints that you work within. Um, and once we do have some power in some sense, do, how do we use that to change, um, the way in which we do things? So those of us who then go on to create our own spaces, um, on our own practices, that's when we say that, look, this is not how we're going to do this here so that there are alternatives for those young black women, for other women who are working and saying that this is different. And as well, you know, for example, doing what Chimamanda is doing, advocating and speaking out against some of the pressures that a lot of us do feel. I suppose for me, it's a disappointment when I'm, you know, you're young, you're vibrant, you're 26. And by looking at your photograph, you're gorgeous. For me, it's, it's appalling that you should feel that you need, there's some pressure to, to, to have this, this so-called Anglo-Saxon polished look. Um, you know, and, and my, what I'm getting from the articles, a lot of people are saying, actually now I've realized it's, I can, I can be sexy as, as, um, um, uh, I'm just trying to find her first name, Baola. Um, Danielle says, um, you know, um, I'm going to rise and look fresh. You know, I love that quote, you know, her idea that you actually needed a blazer to package yourself. And she said, well, you know, you can actually have an intellectualized idea in a crop top. Um, and I suppose then there are enough women who have been successful, who should be able to, to have the maturity to be successful and say, live in your skin, be in your skin. Dreadlocks can be polished. Um, you know, have that, that Afro, um, and, and walk it with style and, and intellect. And can we not use as much, uh, you know, can we not work on our mind as much as we, work on a surgery to, to have our boobs bigger and a diet in order to be some mold of something which is long gone and, and, and, and unattainable. Definitely. I mean, look, but again, even if we, it is, it is to say that they're enough successful women, how many women, um, own, uh, or are on the seats of JC listed companies, right? Or on the boards of those companies. Um, it's less than 10% of JC listed companies where you have women who, who are leading those companies. How many, um, black people own, um, the JSEs or companies on the JSE as well. It's less than 10% of, well, that's a disputed number with what Jacob Zuma says versus what the JSE says. But again, it's who gets to set the tone there. Um, and until that actually changes, there's a lot that needs to still be done. You'll find that, I mean, I actually have a, an accounting background. So the very corporate space is where I, was what I understand more so than the creative space that myself, Danielle and Samamkele, um, and Nova are speaking about in the article. And there, there's a far less tolerance of the kind of things that we're talking about here. The creative space, um, is obviously one that's a lot freer and you can express yourself a lot more, but the corporate space, um, is one in which there's going to be a lot more pushback. Um, and until you change those ownership structures, until you de-patriarchalize, until you, um, de-racialize those sectors, it, it will not change very much. Um, it does lie within those of us who do have those options to continue to make those changes and to speak out about these things and practice it as well. Um, but it's, you know, like many other things in this country, it's not going to change until we make sure that we're not actually living in a non-racist and non-sexist society. And I suppose that's my concern is that these things linger on. These are terms that people say, well, why, when are we going to get there? I mean, we are in a transition. I mean, there's, there's, there's no doubt about it. My side, I mean, in terms of where you are, I'm virtually an old toppy, you know, and, and, and these are conversations that are not new. And I suppose for me, the fact that you, you guys are so young and vibrant and clearly smart and well-versed, um, and, and, and you, you're walking your talk and, and you're powerful and that, that you still have a sense that there's pushback and there's this pressure. And I'd love to hear from listeners. Do you think, you know, do you think there is a way out of this or do we just accept it and play the game? As you say, it's a corporate game. Um, and, or, or do we, do we live in our skins and, and say, and, and live our smartness and our sexiness and our hotness? Um, and our non-sexiness and whatever it is. I mean, the point is to just be whatever it is that we want to be, um, or are. And I think it, you know, what you're saying is this surprise that, oh, why is it that this young generation is fighting these battles that we're still fighting? Yeah. It's the same as those who don't understand the young black people were saying roads must fall. Um, it's the same battles that there's a whole lot that hasn't been fixed or hasn't been addressed yet. So it's not surprising at all that we face a lot of these struggles because we haven't yet got into where we need to as a country yet. So that's, that's, that's my two cents to the, to the response that, you know, why do the young people still have to face a lot of these issues? You know, I work with young people and what I often say to them is, is be the leader you are and, and, um, be, be strong in what you are and, and don't live to other people's agendas. But I also realize that there is a reality and, and the pushback that you speak of can be often, um, not something that people can put a finger on, but you feel it and it's there. And, and I wonder how, um, easy it is to miss if you're, if it's not directed at you, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I suppose that's, that, that's why I was making the comment I did earlier about myself and where I came from. And perhaps I couldn't see it because I had an automatic privilege. Yeah. That came from where I came from. No, definitely. And I think that, you know, from feminist theory, um, you get, you know, standpoint theory, which is about marginalized or centering the most marginalized voices. That's where you can get the most, most transformative kind of change because that's, you know, it's almost a sense of looking up from the bottom of the ladder. That's where you'll see a lot because, you know, a lot of the blind spots we have from different, um, spheres of privilege, um, and they're very intersecting whether it's middle class privileges that we might have or it's racial or gender privileges, um, that we might have. So I think the more we do work to, um, bring in those different voices so that we can see a lot, because there's a lot I often see as a middle class, um, black woman as well. Um, but if we work a lot more to diversify what we do get to hear and get insights into, I think we can have a lot more perspectives, um, in what we hear and in our media particularly. And a lot of the politics is about hair, isn't it? I mean, you, you mentioned Afro and having to tame your Afro. Um, I think it's, it's, it's an easy way for people to understand what it is that, that I, um, am talking about in terms of an Anglo-Saxon look. Um, but it's also, also in terms of how you do your makeup as well. So are you trying to make yourself look a little bit lighter? Um, you know, there's ways in which you can do your, your makeup that you can have a little bit more of a, um, sort of Anglo-Saxon look, you know, rosy cheeks and, and trying to make your, your features look a little bit more Eurocentric, even in terms of the kind of dress as well. Um, there are looks that are seen as more sort of African looking. And sometimes, I mean, with the very silly word, ethnic looking, um, and the, the kind of clothes that you're wearing. Um, but you choose as well, you know, is this an outfit from Zara or an Italian made shoe or, you know, all of those kinds of things. So hair, of course, is a, is a very visceral one. Something that a lot of us would have known from school, whether, you know, for example, I remember when I did gymnastics as a young child and, you know, they would say, you know, just, just do your hair this way. Like, you know, it's, it's, it would be time for the competition and the teachers would tell us, okay. And I don't know, I can't remember how they said, particularly for the black girls, but they said, you know, you guys must do your hair like for Alicia and Felicia would have had her hair straight up in a bun, a very tight bun that really hurt her hair. And it was relaxed and it was so-called neat. Um, and the white girls could simply just, you know, put up a bun. Um, and those are the ways in which you start learning as a child, that these are the ways in which I should show us into the world in order for me to be acceptable in order for me to win the prize. So I think there's a whole lot of work that we have to do, um, in order to change the spaces that we, that we move in.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.42, "text": " I'm going to be talking with

that came out on smart women being hot babes. And I asked the question, why does it still hurt smart women to be seen as hot? I thought this was something that was cured. Here's a whole lot of really young South African women talking about how they had to, if you like, to consider what it meant to be serious, to try and look older to be serious. And I thought that was quite sad that we weren't able to be real. Jackie via Facebook says, great. She says, I'm a hot babe, Lindsay. I have a malfunctioning hermitage and I shop at pep stores. No chance of someone wearing the same outfit as me. No chance of someone's even setting foot in pep stores. She says, I'm serious, not a chance. So she's taking a bit of humor in terms of on smart woman being hot babes. And I suppose there's always a pressure if you're smart and if you're gorgeous, that people, if you're gorgeous, will think that you are a fifi and not take you very serious, which is certainly something that is frustrating for women who are trying to make a place in South Africa. This sense of having to dumb down and act pretty rather than smart and almost as if people spend more time on the image and the issue of surgeries and diets than looking at the power of what it means to be smart. You know, we hear about young people pretending not to be clever so that they're not singled out. I was saddened that still it's 2015 and there's some young woman feeling this pressure. So my question also is, where does the pressure come from? You know, if there is pressure to look serious, where does it come from? Who puts the pressure on us? And at what point do we buy into that pressure? So this article was by Simankele Dlakavu. And now listen to me, I'm getting stuck. Dlakavu. But the person I'm going to be talking to this morning, her name is Panashi. She comes from Ilova. And she is the editor and founder of Vanguard magazine. And she was interviewed as part of this interview. She was one of several women interviewed as part of the interview by Simankele. And on the issue of smart women being hot babes. Panashi, hi, good morning to you. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for being on air. The bit you might not have heard because you were on with Amy that I was talking about is how sad I was that here are all young women feeling still a pressure to try and look serious. Of course. I mean, we still live in a patriarchal society. So we are not going to be shielded from that. So as long as, you know, those relations haven't changed, then it makes sense that we will continue to fight or have to fight that kind of battle. And for our daughters and our granddaughters until, you know, we've ridded ourselves of, you know, that form of patriarchy that also has a very racial term as well. You know, in the article, you said that, you know, that, that, you know, you felt that there was this pressure to look serious and have this polished look. And you and you said it's not a neutral thing. No, of course not. So often, you know, for example, we'll speak about having a polished look and, you know, that you shouldn't have an exotic look. And often by exotic, it means, you know, no efforts, you know, unrelaxed hair, no dreadlocks, you know, that kind of thing is going to be sanctioned. So it means that, you know, in order for my hair to look polished, it means often that my hair must be relaxed. And you also see this in schools as well, where you'll find in school codes of conduct that they will say, you know, no exotic hairstyle such as efforts, which is, you know, natural hair. Exactly as it comes out of my head. So it's definitely not neutral because, you know, it excludes many black women in particular based on, you know, what is natural to us. I suppose, you know, I sense a frustration. I remember many years ago, I was doing a training and the lady who was coming to assess the whole process, assess the person who was doing the training, had a good chat with me. And she says, I wished I could be as free as you were in terms of your look. And she says, I wished I could wear dreadlocks at the Department of Labor. And I was, I was floored. And I said, why can't you? You know, and I realized that part of that was probably where I came from my white middle class privilege, where I never had a sense of, it was okay for me to be smart and look however I wanted because I never needed to prove anything, if you like. Exactly. I mean, even if it's not something that is in a code of conduct, you know, that it explicitly says, do not have this kind of look. It's definitely not something that is generally looked upon with any sort of positive sound. So generally, you know, it's the kind of thing that maybe someone who, you know, has some sort of empathy for you and your career might pull you aside and say, you know, maybe you might want to change your hairstyle. And it definitely is coming from, it is a privilege to be able to be who you are because, you know, and it goes through just generally what particularly the experience of black people, black women in corporate South Africa is having to constantly prove yourself. And part of that proving yourself is an alienation of self. So definitely there's very much a patriarchal and a racial tone to, or sense to how it is that we have to be. We have to show up in the workplace. But now I've got an important question for you. The workplace is not, is changing. And oftentimes, yes, I understand the context in which you are, but the shape and size of corporate places is changing. My question is, where does that come, where does the pressure come from? And who is pushing the, putting the pressure there? And how much are women to blame? You know, when you're called aside, is it a woman who's calling you aside? In other words, is it not our perception of what is okay? In other words, I have a concern when I see a department that, for example, is women and it's still happening. That I don't get. You know, I really hate to victim blame. At the end of the day, it is even if, you know, first of all, patriarchy doesn't need, um, women to, or it doesn't need men to perpetuate. It's, um, racism or rather white supremacy doesn't need white people to perpetuate it. Right. Because, you know, if this is, those are the constraints with which you work. Um, these people have learned that this is the best way in which you can survive. And honestly, it actually can be seen as someone doing you a favor because they've understood that these are the rules. These are the ways in which you can survive corporate better. So it's better for me to help you by doing what it is that will help you succeed within that. So if you don't deconstruct that system, it doesn't matter whether it's women or men or black people, white people doing it. At the end of the day, it still serves the same system. So it's not surprising that women will do that because they bear the brunt of it. So women can be just as patriarchal. Black people can be just as white supremacists because they've learned the ways in which, or the codes for which, um, you need to succeed in the current socioeconomic system in South Africa. But, you know, before I was talking to you, I was, I was talking about the issue of, aren't we the ones, you know, we can always blame other people and blame the government, but, you know, we are the government. And in this case, can it not change by the people? Can the people not in the system change it? I mean, I was shocked. I mean, I understand in a corporate environment, but I was shocked in the article, um, when Chimamanda, um, Arichi says, you know, as a 26 year old, she, she hid her high heels, but it wasn't in a corporate setting. She was, she was an author and she felt, she, she felt that she wanted to be taken seriously as an author. And so she hid her high heels. She, she felt that orange, uh, which happened to flatter her, her skin tone was too loud. Her earrings were too low. I mean that, that, you know, everything she felt she should wear was uninteresting, too bright, too fitted and too unusual. And that for me is shocking. Um, and it almost seems to me that women have to be successful in order to say, no, this is, this is, this is, this is ridiculous. Not what I have to do. Um, look again, it's not, it doesn't come out of nowhere. I mean, it was funny because just before, um, just preparing for this interview, um, my boyfriend decided to just quickly Google the article and that's what Mom Gilly wrote and, you know, smart women, hot babes. And what came out of it was a whole range of very sexist articles about hot, smart women or, you know, ranking the hottest, um, smart woman, um, and all kinds of things. And you see so many times when a woman who has, you know, a role that has nothing to do with her looks is, um, completely shamed for the way in which she dresses, whether it's been your Hillary Clinton or your Jim Marcus, as this happens all the time. Um, so it's not surprising. It's responding to the social cues that are out there that, you know, if you look a certain way, you know, it must be, you know, mutually exclusive that, you know, beauty and brains don't go together. We always hear that or see that. Um, and it, it is unfortunate that it does take some level of success or having no, less of a sense of wanting to prove yourself. Um, you know, for example, and I say this in the article that when I first started out in corporate South Africa, I had to do very much of the growing up in terms of my look, um, that Chimamanda did, particularly being a young black woman. I had to do some, much more to ensure that people took me seriously. And the way in which I looked wasn't a factor, um, in what I did. So it's responding to very real conditions. I think I understand what you're saying in terms of saying we need to have a sense of agency. Um, so I think the importance is understanding what are the constraints that you work within. Um, and once we do have some power in some sense, do, how do we use that to change, um, the way in which we do things? So those of us who then go on to create our own spaces, um, on our own practices, that's when we say that, look, this is not how we're going to do this here so that there are alternatives for those young black women, for other women who are working and saying that this is different. And as well, you know, for example, doing what Chimamanda is doing, advocating and speaking out against some of the pressures that a lot of us do feel. I suppose for me, it's a disappointment when I'm, you know, you're young, you're vibrant, you're 26. And by looking at your photograph, you're gorgeous. For me, it's, it's appalling that you should feel that you need, there's some pressure to, to, to have this, this so-called Anglo-Saxon polished look. Um, you know, and, and my, what I'm getting from the articles, a lot of people are saying, actually now I've realized it's, I can, I can be sexy as, as, um, um, uh, I'm just trying to find her first name, Baola. Um, Danielle says, um, you know, um, I'm going to rise and look fresh. You know, I love that quote, you know, her idea that you actually needed a blazer to package yourself. And she said, well, you know, you can actually have an intellectualized idea in a crop top. Um, and I suppose then there are enough women who have been successful, who should be able to, to have the maturity to be successful and say, live in your skin, be in your skin. Dreadlocks can be polished. Um, you know, have that, that Afro, um, and, and walk it with style and, and intellect. And can we not use as much, uh, you know, can we not work on our mind as much as we, work on a surgery to, to have our boobs bigger and a diet in order to be some mold of something which is long gone and, and, and, and unattainable. Definitely. I mean, look, but again, even if we, it is, it is to say that they're enough successful women, how many women, um, own, uh, or are on the seats of JC listed companies, right? Or on the boards of those companies. Um, it's less than 10% of JC listed companies where you have women who, who are leading those companies. How many, um, black people own, um, the JSEs or companies on the JSE as well. It's less than 10% of, well, that's a disputed number with what Jacob Zuma says versus what the JSE says. But again, it's who gets to set the tone there. Um, and until that actually changes, there's a lot that needs to still be done. You'll find that, I mean, I actually have a, an accounting background. So the very corporate space is where I, was what I understand more so than the creative space that myself, Danielle and Samamkele, um, and Nova are speaking about in the article. And there, there's a far less tolerance of the kind of things that we're talking about here. The creative space, um, is obviously one that's a lot freer and you can express yourself a lot more, but the corporate space, um, is one in which there's going to be a lot more pushback. Um, and until you change those ownership structures, until you de-patriarchalize, until you, um, de-racialize those sectors, it, it will not change very much. Um, it does lie within those of us who do have those options to continue to make those changes and to speak out about these things and practice it as well. Um, but it's, you know, like many other things in this country, it's not going to change until we make sure that we're not actually living in a non-racist and non-sexist society. And I suppose that's my concern is that these things linger on. These are terms that people say, well, why, when are we going to get there? I mean, we are in a transition. I mean, there's, there's, there's no doubt about it. My side, I mean, in terms of where you are, I'm virtually an old toppy, you know, and, and, and these are conversations that are not new. And I suppose for me, the fact that you, you guys are so young and vibrant and clearly smart and well-versed, um, and, and, and you, you're walking your talk and, and you're powerful and that, that you still have a sense that there's pushback and there's this pressure. And I'd love to hear from listeners. Do you think, you know, do you think there is a way out of this or do we just accept it and play the game? As you say, it's a corporate game. Um, and, or, or do we, do we live in our skins and, and say, and, and live our smartness and our sexiness and our hotness? Um, and our non-sexiness and whatever it is. I mean, the point is to just be whatever it is that we want to be, um, or are. And I think it, you know, what you're saying is this surprise that, oh, why is it that this young generation is fighting these battles that we're still fighting? Yeah. It's the same as those who don't understand the young black people were saying roads must fall. Um, it's the same battles that there's a whole lot that hasn't been fixed or hasn't been addressed yet. So it's not surprising at all that we face a lot of these struggles because we haven't yet got into where we need to as a country yet. So that's, that's, that's my two cents to the, to the response that, you know, why do the young people still have to face a lot of these issues? You know, I work with young people and what I often say to them is, is be the leader you are and, and, um, be, be strong in what you are and, and don't live to other people's agendas. But I also realize that there is a reality and, and the pushback that you speak of can be often, um, not something that people can put a finger on, but you feel it and it's there. And, and I wonder how, um, easy it is to miss if you're, if it's not directed at you, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I suppose that's, that, that's why I was making the comment I did earlier about myself and where I came from. And perhaps I couldn't see it because I had an automatic privilege. Yeah. That came from where I came from. No, definitely. And I think that, you know, from feminist theory, um, you get, you know, standpoint theory, which is about marginalized or centering the most marginalized voices. That's where you can get the most, most transformative kind of change because that's, you know, it's almost a sense of looking up from the bottom of the ladder. That's where you'll see a lot because, you know, a lot of the blind spots we have from different, um, spheres of privilege, um, and they're very intersecting whether it's middle class privileges that we might have or it's racial or gender privileges, um, that we might have. So I think the more we do work to, um, bring in those different voices so that we can see a lot, because there's a lot I often see as a middle class, um, black woman as well. Um, but if we work a lot more to diversify what we do get to hear and get insights into, I think we can have a lot more perspectives, um, in what we hear and in our media particularly. And a lot of the politics is about hair, isn't it? I mean, you, you mentioned Afro and having to tame your Afro. Um, I think it's, it's, it's an easy way for people to understand what it is that, that I, um, am talking about in terms of an Anglo-Saxon look. Um, but it's also, also in terms of how you do your makeup as well. So are you trying to make yourself look a little bit lighter? Um, you know, there's ways in which you can do your, your makeup that you can have a little bit more of a, um, sort of Anglo-Saxon look, you know, rosy cheeks and, and trying to make your, your features look a little bit more Eurocentric, even in terms of the kind of dress as well. Um, there are looks that are seen as more sort of African looking. And sometimes, I mean, with the very silly word, ethnic looking, um, and the, the kind of clothes that you're wearing. Um, but you choose as well, you know, is this an outfit from Zara or an Italian made shoe or, you know, all of those kinds of things. So hair, of course, is a, is a very visceral one. Something that a lot of us would have known from school, whether, you know, for example, I remember when I did gymnastics as a young child and, you know, they would say, you know, just, just do your hair this way. Like, you know, it's, it's, it would be time for the competition and the teachers would tell us, okay. And I don't know, I can't remember how they said, particularly for the black girls, but they said, you know, you guys must do your hair like for Alicia and Felicia would have had her hair straight up in a bun, a very tight bun that really hurt her hair. And it was relaxed and it was so-called neat. Um, and the white girls could simply just, you know, put up a bun. Um, and those are the ways in which you start learning as a child, that these are the ways in which I should show us into the world in order for me to be acceptable in order for me to win the prize. So I think there's a whole lot of work that we have to do, um, in order to change the spaces that we, that we move in.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.1, "text": " I'm going to be
