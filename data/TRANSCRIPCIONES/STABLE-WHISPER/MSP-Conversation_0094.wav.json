{"text": " This is our first podcast. We're generally going to be talking about Dragon Ball Z. We're huge fans, and we're kind of breaking down each episode by certain topics that we pick weekly or bi-weekly, depending on our availability. So anyway, today we're going to be talking about Krillin. Krillin gets a lot of crap on the internet for being a lame character sometimes. He dies a lot, and he gets compared to Yamcha a lot. But I'm here with my co-host, Sam, and we're going to be talking about Krillin today. So we were discussing before the show kind of our thoughts about Krillin. How about you kind of, what do you think about Krillin as a character? Krillin, I feel like he always gets made fun of, but really he is incredibly strong and is actually a very good character. For example, Krillin is underpowered against almost every enemy. Almost every fight he's underpowered, but is always willing to try. Like against the androids, against Frieza, he's always willing to just go out there and try. Like he goes to Planet Namek with Gohan, who at that point is relatively weak, and Bulma in search for the Dragon Balls to save his friends. It's pretty cool to me. What I've always thought interesting about Krillin was he's a human, and he's fighting with Saiyans, you know? He's one of, he's, as during my research I found that, I don't know if this is true towards the end of the series, but at one point Krillin is the strongest human on Earth, and we don't know if Yamcha or him is the strongest, you know, at the end. But assuming that Krillin is probably the strongest fighter, and it's interesting that he's against all these other people, and he is always stepping up to the plate, even against, or not against, but, you know, alongside Saiyans, who are, you know, the most powerful fighters in the universe. To continue that, the Saiyans are a race of fighters, and Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan, pretty much by the end of this, you know, series, are all infinitely stronger than Krillin. But Krillin always steps up to the plate. And another point on why I think Krillin is absolutely relevant is because without him, Goku wouldn't have gone Super Saiyan at first. Yeah, at first. I don't think that, I think they would have reached, you know, Super Saiyan eventually, but I think, you know, as the show always states, that Saiyans need that extra push of anger or something to give them the ability, at first at least. And I thought it was interesting that without Krillin, he, or Goku, would have not been able to defeat Frieza, in my honest opinion. Without Krillin's death, I think it would have been a lot longer before Goku would have reached being a Super Saiyan. And I also like how Kira Toriyami decided to pick Krillin as that push, and not his, you know, Goku's son, Gohan, or anybody else. It was Krillin that was actually the deciding factor there. Well, the interesting thing is, Krillin and, you know, well, referencing back to Dragon Ball, is Krillin and Gohan, or Goku, I'm sorry, were best friends growing up. I mean, yes, I think that, you know, of course, Goku and Gohan have a special connection as father and son, but Goku and Krillin have so much, a strong, not so much more, but a very strong connection as friends. And I think that's what gave him the push. Right, and I understand that, but I like the fact that Akira Toriyama picked Krillin instead of Gohan, because Gohan, he could have easily picked Gohan as the one that was killed, but he chose Krillin instead. True, he did, he did. On the, you know, flip side, though, Krillin has a couple blunders throughout the series. I think most characters have some flaws, though. Every character's flawed. And the most notable for me is when he doesn't disable Android 18 because he's got, like, a crush on her or whatever, and really that's ultimately the deciding factor, or deciding factor that completed Cell, and Cell causes a lot of turmoil for the world and the Z fighters. But do you think that if Krillin would have disabled the Androids, what do you think would have happened there? Um, you know, I don't really know. I feel that Cell wouldn't have been completed, and they could have easily destroyed Cell. Because Vegeta and Trunks, actually Vegeta was wanting Cell to be completed, so he would have a challenge when he thought he had reached a level past Super Saiyan. And they were easily destroying Cell, Trunks and Vegeta. And so, I think it would have definitely changed the series a lot, but Cell wouldn't have really been as big of a big deal. Well, I do agree because, um, that was probably one of my least favorite parts for Krillin, is him not disabling the Androids. But I really felt like it would have been detrimental to the whole story, and actually the development of other characters. Um, without the final struggle to defeat Cell, I don't think Gohan would have reached the level that he was at at that age. And I feel like the times of peace where Gohan kind of softens up in, you know, the great Saiyan Man series and everything, I feel like that would have happened a lot sooner. I feel like the demise of Cell really helped a lot of the characters, uh, you know, open up more and be able to reach, especially Vegeta if you think about it. I mean, without Trunks being so injured, I don't feel like we would have seen Vegeta as more of a fatherly figure, as more of a, his turning point to a, you know, a good Z-Fighter, you know? Like, not a, he was such a negative anti-hero at that point. Another factor into that, um, is it opened up Hercule, Mr. Satan, who wasn't huge until the very end. He played a very huge part in destroying Boo. And, uh, almost, I like the part that, uh, Krillin doesn't enjoy 18 because it makes him actually seem human. Yeah, it really does. I think that, we talked about how all characters have flaws, but, um, it's, it really shows that he's human. And, um, it's kind of a reminder, that's why I think Krillin is so relatable as a character. I don't, I don't dislike Krillin as a character. He's actually one of my favorite because he is relatable. He is a human and you have to realize that as a human, he's going to make mistakes. Saiyans, on the other hand, still make mistakes, but they're, they have a different level of that. You know, Krillin is on our level still and he, we have to remind ourselves that he is a human and he is, you know, risking his life. He has, you know, of course he gets wished back and everything, but he is a human life, you know? And another example that actually shows Krillin is pretty strong is that when Cell made his Cell Juniors, and, I mean, they were pummeling the Z Fighters. Krillin, until he stopped to, you know, check up on Goku, who was injured from Cell, was holding his own, whereas the Saiyans had to turn Super Saiyan to fight these Cell Juniors. But Krillin, on his own, was, pretty, you know, sufficiently holding his own. No, I remember I was doing some reading on that actually last night. It was, it's amazing that, that the Z Fighters, including Trunks, Vegeta, Goku, even Piccolo, were having such a hard time with the Cell Juniors and Krillin was fighting off one by himself, which says that Krillin, at that point, was at least the same level as a Super Saiyan or higher. That's my opinion. Of course, but the only time that he, you know, got hurt was when he had to go check on Goku, who was near death, and he turned his back and he got a cheap shot from one of the Cell Juniors. Another thing that kind of relates to that is when Vegeta and Nappa first come down to Earth, Krillin is able to fight three of their men off while, you know, all, most of the characters were, including, including Yamcha, completely got demolished from just one of them, so. Krillin, in one hit, took out three Saiba men and, you know, that was one hit. And when he was actually fighting Nappa, he formed up a Destructo Disc. Yeah, he did almost, he almost killed Nappa, which none of the other Z Fighters were able to do. Yamcha, Tien, Piccolo, all threw whatever they had at Nappa and when Krillin threw his Destructo Disc, Vegeta made a point to tell Nappa to, you know, watch his guard because he actually had scratched him. Yeah, he did freak out. He, he, uh, if, if Vegeta wouldn't have worn Nappa, I do believe that Krillin would have defeated Nappa because, if you think about it, he threw that Destructo Disc and it did cut his face and that was the first actual, uh, blood drawn from Nappa and it was caused by Krillin and that really shows, even before Goku was able to get there, Krillin was probably the most powerful fighter on that field. Maybe not, uh, most powerful, but maybe best fighter. Maybe best fighter. I mean, Piccolo was very strong, but we all, we all know that Piccolo gave his life for Gohan, um, to, you know, to allow Goku to get there on time. But, it really does show the, uh, Krillin's importance as a Z Fighter and, uh, you know, as, you know, he didn't really participate, uh, while Cell was around, uh, too much with, with wanting to actually fight because, you know, Goku wouldn't let anyone besides Gohan fight. Um, it really shows that, um, he is, he's capable of, of keeping up with, with the other Z Fighters and he is not near the, one of the weakest. I mean, if, if I had to say my, my choice for the weakest Z Fighter, it would probably be Yamcha just based on, uh, he doesn't really continue training as a lot of them do and, you know, Krillin kind of settles down when they have, he has a kid with seven years old. Seventeen and... Eighteen. Eighteen, I'm sorry. Um, when he's a, you know, a child and stuff and he decides that, um, you know, the last fight I think he really does is he's gonna participate in the, the, uh, World Martial Arts Tournament. He, he kind of has a small, a small fight against Buu. It didn't really, you know, last, but... But, I, I mean, I think one of the interesting things about Krillin, um, is he kind of puts himself down most of the show. He, he tries to hold himself to Goku if you think about it. He always says, like, you know, I'll never reach Goku's level. I'll never be that. But, Krillin doesn't realize that he is a human and, you know, he is putting himself, himself against Goku, but really, some of the time throughout that series, Krillin is at the same level as Goku, especially during the Cell Jr. fight. Um... Well, that was mostly because Goku was injured from fighting Cell. True. So, um, I wouldn't say that necessarily Krillin is at the same level, but he does hold his own. Yeah, I mean, he, he holds his own and he doesn't give himself that credit, I think. I think in, you know, concluding all that, uh, Krillin always is the one that's watching after people, you know, Gohan, Bulma, and is always, you know, willing to make the run for the Sensu Beans or whatever he has to do. True, I mean, there's, if, if anyone watched the, uh, um, the Cooler's Revenge movie, I know that, uh, him and Gohan play probably one of the most important roles of getting, uh, the Sensu Beans to Goku to defeat Cooler. I mean, um, without, without Krillin's watching and helping, I, you know, Goku may have not been able to defeat Cooler. That, and Krillin all around is, you know, the, I think a main force that causes Goku to be who he is. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think that, um, Krillin is what kind of makes Goku human, in a sense. He, uh, he's his best friend, he was raised with Krillin, him and Krillin always trained together, um, Krillin is, is almost like Goku's right-hand man without ever being said, you know? And I think for that, that makes Krillin a very relevant and respectable character, and is, plays a, actually a pretty big role in the series, whether he gets made fun of for dying a lot. I believe he actually dies less than a lot of the other Z fighters, so. True, I think he does too. I think, and he gets revived, but, uh, just think how many times Goku died and was able to be revived. I mean, yeah, Goku is, you know, technically the world's savior with, with most of the fights, but he doesn't do it alone, and I feel like Krillin helps Goku a lot. But, um, do you have any more points, or? I think that pretty much sums up Krillin as a, as a whole. Um, he's not necessarily the most powerful, I mean, obviously the Saiyans, Piccolo, all surpass him infinitely, but as a fighter, Krillin is very strong and holds his own, and between him and Tien are arguably the strongest humans, I'd say. I have to agree. Well, thank you for listening to our first episode of Attack Ball. Uh, this has been episode one, and we've been talking about Krillin.

We're generally going to be talking about Dragon Ball Z. We're huge fans, and we're kind of breaking down each episode by certain topics that we pick weekly or bi-weekly, depending on our availability. So anyway, today we're going to be talking about Krillin. Krillin gets a lot of crap on the internet for being a lame character sometimes. He dies a lot, and he gets compared to Yamcha a lot. But I'm here with my co-host, Sam, and we're going to be talking about Krillin today. So we were discussing before the show kind of our thoughts about Krillin. How about you kind of, what do you think about Krillin as a character? Krillin, I feel like he always gets made fun of, but really he is incredibly strong and is actually a very good character. For example, Krillin is underpowered against almost every enemy. Almost every fight he's underpowered, but is always willing to try. Like against the androids, against Frieza, he's always willing to just go out there and try. Like he goes to Planet Namek with Gohan, who at that point is relatively weak, and Bulma in search for the Dragon Balls to save his friends. It's pretty cool to me. What I've always thought interesting about Krillin was he's a human, and he's fighting with Saiyans, you know? He's one of, he's, as during my research I found that, I don't know if this is true towards the end of the series, but at one point Krillin is the strongest human on Earth, and we don't know if Yamcha or him is the strongest, you know, at the end. But assuming that Krillin is probably the strongest fighter, and it's interesting that he's against all these other people, and he is always stepping up to the plate, even against, or not against, but, you know, alongside Saiyans, who are, you know, the most powerful fighters in the universe. To continue that, the Saiyans are a race of fighters, and Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan, pretty much by the end of this, you know, series, are all infinitely stronger than Krillin. But Krillin always steps up to the plate. And another point on why I think Krillin is absolutely relevant is because without him, Goku wouldn't have gone Super Saiyan at first. Yeah, at first. I don't think that, I think they would have reached, you know, Super Saiyan eventually, but I think, you know, as the show always states, that Saiyans need that extra push of anger or something to give them the ability, at first at least. And I thought it was interesting that without Krillin, he, or Goku, would have not been able to defeat Frieza, in my honest opinion. Without Krillin's death, I think it would have been a lot longer before Goku would have reached being a Super Saiyan. And I also like how Kira Toriyami decided to pick Krillin as that push, and not his, you know, Goku's son, Gohan, or anybody else. It was Krillin that was actually the deciding factor there. Well, the interesting thing is, Krillin and, you know, well, referencing back to Dragon Ball, is Krillin and Gohan, or Goku, I'm sorry, were best friends growing up. I mean, yes, I think that, you know, of course, Goku and Gohan have a special connection as father and son, but Goku and Krillin have so much, a strong, not so much more, but a very strong connection as friends. And I think that's what gave him the push. Right, and I understand that, but I like the fact that Akira Toriyama picked Krillin instead of Gohan, because Gohan, he could have easily picked Gohan as the one that was killed, but he chose Krillin instead. True, he did, he did. On the, you know, flip side, though, Krillin has a couple blunders throughout the series. I think most characters have some flaws, though. Every character's flawed. And the most notable for me is when he doesn't disable Android 18 because he's got, like, a crush on her or whatever, and really that's ultimately the deciding factor, or deciding factor that completed Cell, and Cell causes a lot of turmoil for the world and the Z fighters. But do you think that if Krillin would have disabled the Androids, what do you think would have happened there? Um, you know, I don't really know. I feel that Cell wouldn't have been completed, and they could have easily destroyed Cell. Because Vegeta and Trunks, actually Vegeta was wanting Cell to be completed, so he would have a challenge when he thought he had reached a level past Super Saiyan. And they were easily destroying Cell, Trunks and Vegeta. And so, I think it would have definitely changed the series a lot, but Cell wouldn't have really been as big of a big deal. Well, I do agree because, um, that was probably one of my least favorite parts for Krillin, is him not disabling the Androids. But I really felt like it would have been detrimental to the whole story, and actually the development of other characters. Um, without the final struggle to defeat Cell, I don't think Gohan would have reached the level that he was at at that age. And I feel like the times of peace where Gohan kind of softens up in, you know, the great Saiyan Man series and everything, I feel like that would have happened a lot sooner. I feel like the demise of Cell really helped a lot of the characters, uh, you know, open up more and be able to reach, especially Vegeta if you think about it. I mean, without Trunks being so injured, I don't feel like we would have seen Vegeta as more of a fatherly figure, as more of a, his turning point to a, you know, a good Z-Fighter, you know? Like, not a, he was such a negative anti-hero at that point. Another factor into that, um, is it opened up Hercule, Mr. Satan, who wasn't huge until the very end. He played a very huge part in destroying Boo. And, uh, almost, I like the part that, uh, Krillin doesn't enjoy 18 because it makes him actually seem human. Yeah, it really does. I think that, we talked about how all characters have flaws, but, um, it's, it really shows that he's human. And, um, it's kind of a reminder, that's why I think Krillin is so relatable as a character. I don't, I don't dislike Krillin as a character. He's actually one of my favorite because he is relatable. He is a human and you have to realize that as a human, he's going to make mistakes. Saiyans, on the other hand, still make mistakes, but they're, they have a different level of that. You know, Krillin is on our level still and he, we have to remind ourselves that he is a human and he is, you know, risking his life. He has, you know, of course he gets wished back and everything, but he is a human life, you know? And another example that actually shows Krillin is pretty strong is that when Cell made his Cell Juniors, and, I mean, they were pummeling the Z Fighters. Krillin, until he stopped to, you know, check up on Goku, who was injured from Cell, was holding his own, whereas the Saiyans had to turn Super Saiyan to fight these Cell Juniors. But Krillin, on his own, was, pretty, you know, sufficiently holding his own. No, I remember I was doing some reading on that actually last night. It was, it's amazing that, that the Z Fighters, including Trunks, Vegeta, Goku, even Piccolo, were having such a hard time with the Cell Juniors and Krillin was fighting off one by himself, which says that Krillin, at that point, was at least the same level as a Super Saiyan or higher. That's my opinion. Of course, but the only time that he, you know, got hurt was when he had to go check on Goku, who was near death, and he turned his back and he got a cheap shot from one of the Cell Juniors. Another thing that kind of relates to that is when Vegeta and Nappa first come down to Earth, Krillin is able to fight three of their men off while, you know, all, most of the characters were, including, including Yamcha, completely got demolished from just one of them, so. Krillin, in one hit, took out three Saiba men and, you know, that was one hit. And when he was actually fighting Nappa, he formed up a Destructo Disc. Yeah, he did almost, he almost killed Nappa, which none of the other Z Fighters were able to do. Yamcha, Tien, Piccolo, all threw whatever they had at Nappa and when Krillin threw his Destructo Disc, Vegeta made a point to tell Nappa to, you know, watch his guard because he actually had scratched him. Yeah, he did freak out. He, he, uh, if, if Vegeta wouldn't have worn Nappa, I do believe that Krillin would have defeated Nappa because, if you think about it, he threw that Destructo Disc and it did cut his face and that was the first actual, uh, blood drawn from Nappa and it was caused by Krillin and that really shows, even before Goku was able to get there, Krillin was probably the most powerful fighter on that field. Maybe not, uh, most powerful, but maybe best fighter. Maybe best fighter. I mean, Piccolo was very strong, but we all, we all know that Piccolo gave his life for Gohan, um, to, you know, to allow Goku to get there on time. But, it really does show the, uh, Krillin's importance as a Z Fighter and, uh, you know, as, you know, he didn't really participate, uh, while Cell was around, uh, too much with, with wanting to actually fight because, you know, Goku wouldn't let anyone besides Gohan fight. Um, it really shows that, um, he is, he's capable of, of keeping up with, with the other Z Fighters and he is not near the, one of the weakest. I mean, if, if I had to say my, my choice for the weakest Z Fighter, it would probably be Yamcha just based on, uh, he doesn't really continue training as a lot of them do and, you know, Krillin kind of settles down when they have, he has a kid with seven years old. Seventeen and... Eighteen. Eighteen, I'm sorry. Um, when he's a, you know, a child and stuff and he decides that, um, you know, the last fight I think he really does is he's gonna participate in the, the, uh, World Martial Arts Tournament. He, he kind of has a small, a small fight against Buu. It didn't really, you know, last, but... But, I, I mean, I think one of the interesting things about Krillin, um, is he kind of puts himself down most of the show. He, he tries to hold himself to Goku if you think about it. He always says, like, you know, I'll never reach Goku's level. I'll never be that. But, Krillin doesn't realize that he is a human and, you know, he is putting himself, himself against Goku, but really, some of the time throughout that series, Krillin is at the same level as Goku, especially during the Cell Jr. fight. Um... Well, that was mostly because Goku was injured from fighting Cell. True. So, um, I wouldn't say that necessarily Krillin is at the same level, but he does hold his own. Yeah, I mean, he, he holds his own and he doesn't give himself that credit, I think. I think in, you know, concluding all that, uh, Krillin always is the one that's watching after people, you know, Gohan, Bulma, and is always, you know, willing to make the run for the Sensu Beans or whatever he has to do. True, I mean, there's, if, if anyone watched the, uh, um, the Cooler's Revenge movie, I know that, uh, him and Gohan play probably one of the most important roles of getting, uh, the Sensu Beans to Goku to defeat Cooler. I mean, um, without, without Krillin's watching and helping, I, you know, Goku may have not been able to defeat Cooler. That, and Krillin all around is, you know, the, I think a main force that causes Goku to be who he is. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think that, um, Krillin is what kind of makes Goku human, in a sense. He, uh, he's his best friend, he was raised with Krillin, him and Krillin always trained together, um, Krillin is, is almost like Goku's right-hand man without ever being said, you know? And I think for that, that makes Krillin a very relevant and respectable character, and is, plays a, actually a pretty big role in the series, whether he gets made fun of for dying a lot. I believe he actually dies less than a lot of the other Z fighters, so. True, I think he does too. I think, and he gets revived, but, uh, just think how many times Goku died and was able to be revived. I mean, yeah, Goku is, you know, technically the world's savior with, with most of the fights, but he doesn't do it alone, and I feel like Krillin helps Goku a lot. But, um, do you have any more points, or? I think that pretty much sums up Krillin as a, as a whole. Um, he's not necessarily the most powerful, I mean, obviously the Saiyans, Piccolo, all surpass him infinitely, but as a fighter, Krillin is very strong and holds his own, and between him and Tien are arguably the strongest humans, I'd say. I have to agree. Well, thank you for listening to our first episode of Attack Ball. Uh, this has been episode one, and we've been talking about Krillin. Uh, please, uh, follow us on Twitter, follow us on SoundCloud, or Tumblr, or, uh, Mixler.com. Um, you can just go slash Attack Ball, and, uh, we'll be doing live broadcasts.
