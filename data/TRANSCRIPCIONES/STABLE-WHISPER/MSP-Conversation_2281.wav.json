{"text": " She just keeps saying, like, what have you been doing with your life? You can't play football anymore. Get a new dream. Like, don't you think you would say, like, I fucking have a business. Yeah, I don't get why he. Especially if he's past the point of trying to win her back. Yeah. I don't understand why he keeps it secret before then either. But, like. Let's say this, though. Is that not, like, the most, like, stereotypical rom-com male job? One of my notes is, like, this is, like, the most, in terms of jobs, the most rom-commy stereotype. Fashion designer. It's a pretty rom-commy job. You know? Even if we don't see it that often, just that concept of, like, aspirational. It's creative. Like, she still gets to be professional and kick-ass. And, yes, he has that, like. I mean, that goes back to what I said about, like, Bill Pullman. Yes. It's the same sort of thing where it's, like, oh, this is, like, crafty and creative, but it also is, like, oh, this is totally, like, a. Something to do with your hands. Yeah. And it's manly. But it's also, like, and it's also just incredibly, like, commercial in a way where it's, like, yeah. Yeah. They go to lengths to establish that he has a ton of money. Yeah. And I very cynically was, like, yeah, if they didn't do that, then a lot of people in the theater wouldn't be rooting for them. Because, guys, I've heard a lot of people talk about how moved they are by the scene where she gets engaged to Andrew. Because it's the most stereotypical, like, wish fulfillment thing ever. So, Andrew takes her to Tiffany's. Like, after hours. After hours. And he's just, like, pick any ring you want. And it's fully staffed Tiffany's. Which, for no reason. And they're, like, pulling out rings. They have, like, they have, like, at least one person per counter out of, like, the dozen counters in Tiffany's. Like, why do they all need to be there? Yeah. Like, one guy can pull out a ring. You don't need 13 people. It's more romantic with a big sweeping gesture. But, like, people love that scene so much. Yeah, it's so. That they have to, like, match, like, well, he's rich, too. She's not losing any money if she goes with the other guy. Let's talk about the other guy. Let's talk about. He's fine. Like. I think this is an example of another man's character that is, like I was saying before, sometimes they do it where the guy is perfectly lovely. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. But it's him, too. Yeah. You know what I mean? Primarily, the only problem that he has is that he seems to be a little too excited to, like, stick things to his mother. Yeah. Like, but that's it. Like, that's the whole thing. Like, he says, like, when they decide to have an Alabama wedding. Like, he specifically says, like, can you imagine, like, my mom and all those New York types, like, coming down here? Like, that's, like, that's, like, the one, like, iffy thing is that he always seems really excited to, like, make his mom feel shitty about something. Well, that's also because Melanie hates his mom. I think it's also just, like, kind of, you know, being on her side with that. Maybe, yeah. But, yeah. I don't think that he's, like, aggressively, like, oh, this will really piss mom off. I think he's a fine character. No, no, no. But I would say that's still a minor thing. Yeah. That's the point. It's a good casting for Patrick Dempsey. But, yeah. Like, I appreciate when movies don't have, like, an outright villain as the third in a love triangle. Right. You know what I mean? And this movie does a really good job of that. Apparently, they cut a whole subplot where he had some sort of... A Vanderbilt. Yeah. He had, like, a Vanderbilt after him. You do see that he's engaged to a Vanderbilt, which they included because, like, I think you grow to like Andrew as a character. Especially after he, you know, has come to realize who Melanie actually is and still wants to marry her and agrees to get married in Alabama. Like, he's a dream fiance. Yeah. He is. And I thought that was cool that they sort of established that she could realistically be happy with either choice. Yes. And they do a good job also of sort of... By good job, I mean that they do a good job of giving Melanie dialogue that specifically states that she is conflicted and that she feels that she's equally at home in New York and in Alabama. So, they go to good lengths to show that sort of internal conflict. They don't do it in a particularly subtle way because he just fucking says it. But I appreciate that that's the case. I appreciate that this is a movie that softens as it goes. I think the beginning of it with her family... It's very shrill. It's very almost unwatchable for me. Like, when she's, like, fighting with Jake, he calls the sheriff. She's, like... They're all screaming about the crimes they've committed in the past. Like, it's over the top to a degree that I just kind of am annoyed with. It's a lot of Reese Witherspoon being, like, upset and offended. Yeah, I mean, that's sort of like the shot gas. Yeah, exactly. She does that more in this movie than she did in Legally Blonde somehow. Like, even though Legally Blonde, like... She's a much better character in Legally Blonde. Well, yes, but... Let's not kid ourselves. But also because, like, I feel like... Let's not... Pull that rubric out. Every movie fails in comparison to Legally Blonde. I'm just saying it's surprising because that's sort of, like, surface-level affectation you could easily see applying to a character like Elle Woods. Yeah, but no, they... Elle Woods is awesome. Well, yeah, exactly. Anywho... Now, Andrew's mother, on the other hand... What the fuck is that character? Yeah. So, I just want to take a moment to tell Candace Bergen that she's welcome on our show at any time because I would like to give her a hug, sort of present, always this character. And I don't understand why she had a fucking sitcom devoted to her that was iconic, that was nothing like this. But for some reason, they decided Candace Bergen in movies is always the bitch that gets in the protagonist's way. Always. Sometimes she's a murderer if we're talking about this congeniality. But, like... Sorry for the spoiler. But, like, why do this to Candace Bergen? I don't understand why she's all... I mean, she's good at playing this. But why can't she ever be a good person in a movie? Her character is the mayor of... For no reason. Again, I can't... This is enough how weird it is to watch the movie during the election. Because I'm like, is she supposed to be like a Hillary? Probably. I'm saying... I'm thinking maybe not. And I'm just reading it that way. I'm just reading right after Hillary became, like, senator from New York. Not mayor, though. But it's still the same thing. I don't know. I mean, the larger point... They seem like a Kennedy family more than anything else. The larger point is that the political backdrop for this movie is completely unnecessary. There is no reason for them to be a political family in any way. They could just be generic New York socialites. There is no reason for her to be mayor. There is no reason for her to be the secretary of housing. They introduced stakes through the political platform. Only vaguely. Well, that's why the press is interested in them. I mean, but the whole argument is that, like, oh, like, they would be interested in him regardless because he's, like, the heir to, like... If he was the heir to a wealthy family, if he was male Paris Hilton, like, people would still care. Yeah, but I feel like there's less sort of... I don't know. I feel like there's less on the line if it's not, like, a political thing. I mean, to be honest, I didn't find those stakes compelling in the first place. I don't think that people are that interested in any of this shit when it comes to politics. I mean, they're not super compelling. They also, like, didn't really... Like, she's not running. You know what I mean? She's in office. They do bring up that she wants him to run for president. Which in and of itself I find annoying. Because it's like, why is she more concerned about his chances? She should run for president. I know. I think that, too. Why is she more bothered by his... She keeps calling him the future president. I'm like, but you're mayor of New York. You could run for president now. And that's what I thought she was going for because at first she says, like, he used to date this woman who was a San Francisco lawyer and she says that's perfect. Which makes no sense. I know you'll get to it. But, like, I thought they were getting to the fact that, like, she wants to build a political family so that she can run for president. Right. But she keeps on talking about him running for president. She talks about his dad and how he was, like, a politician. But they never establish how. Or what happened to him. We don't know if he's dead or if they divorced. She killed him. Of course. Killery, right? But, like, she... Which... That's the thing. The assumption would be that he's dead, right? Because no woman in politics... She could survive being, like, being a divorcee. Yeah. Like, that's not a thing that happens. Well, like, if his dad was, in fact, a politician, like, they imply that he was. Right. But they don't build it for sure. Like, they would bring him up, you know, either attending the wedding or bring up that he's not attending the wedding. Right. I'm pretty sure he has died. Yeah. And she's just like, your asshole father cheated on me all the time. Yeah, maybe she is supposed to be a Hillary. I'm sure she is. But, like... That makes me even more uncomfortable. I mean, isn't it drives me nuts, though? I mean, about that California thing. Because, like, I mean, she says, like, oh, he used to date this woman from California. All those electoral votes. Yeah, she has all those electoral votes. And it's like, I'm pretty sure any Democrat from New York is running for president. You get in California, lady. I don't think you have to worry about that. Yeah. It makes more political sense for him to marry someone from the South. Yeah. Because, like, those are electoral votes you wouldn't get otherwise. What a dumbass. Like, it's like, you're not even good at the fake politics that you needlessly practice in the background of this movie. I also, again, want to bring up the fact that, like, she gets involved in the wedding planning. She suggests. She suggests using the plantation as where they should get married. A Democrat who was in a seat earlier worried about, like, her connection to the Confederacy is like, you know, you should get married? Slave house. See, that's the thing. Like, as a real life example, by the way, I'm pretty sure Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively still get shit because they got married at a plantation. And Paula Deen had a problem. Well, that was not just a plantation. No, that went further. But I know, I know. She leaned into it. I know. But, no, like, politically speaking, you're not going to get married anywhere that glorifies the antebellum South. Yeah, you can't get away with that. It's unreal. So, yeah. So, like, that whole, that whole plot, that whole backdrop, it doesn't really add anything except annoyance. And it's vaguely sexist, in my opinion. Probably. Mostly because I use the context of, like, them always using Hannes Bergen in this. So, like, I have a hair trigger for it. But it's like, it's a way, especially when I talked about, like, oh, it's cool how they don't pit the men against each other and the guy, her fiance is still a decent stand-up guy. They still find a way to make this movie a story about one woman pitted against another woman. Yeah, right. Like, her antagonist is a powerful New York woman. Like, why? Yeah. Like, why is that even necessary at all? Her mother hating her, Andrew's mother hating her adds nothing to the plot. It adds, like, a few complications. She sends a private detective down and she has to pretend to be a Carmichael for a while and shit like that. But it's very vague. It's, like, it doesn't add much to the plot. It's not very funny. It's incidental. And it takes away from the movie more than it assists the movie. Yeah, for sure. And I'm just so tired. Give Candace Bergen something better to do. She gets to play slightly different shades of it in Sex and the City, but it's still this character who's, like, an authority figure and is negative and making fun of the hotter, younger woman. I'm like, why? I ask you, why? Why do this to Murphy Brown? It's not fair. I agree. And Candace Bergen is really, really funny. Yeah. Is there anything else? I think I'm out. So, like I said, I like the scene. Like I said, I like that the movie softens as it goes, though. Specifically, I think that it does do a pretty good job of sort of showing this feeling that you get if you, like, live, if you've, like, moved on from the place where you maybe were born or spent your childhood or grew up and you come back, even if you have, like, negative feelings about that place, there are certain things that just, like, nostalgia will get at you. I get that, like, I get, like, that weird feeling if I go back to Israel. Like, I don't like it there, but once in a while, like, I'll walk down the street that I remember from when I was little and be like, oh, remember? I used to go on this ride. And I think they do a good job of that, especially when she goes to, like, the carnival, the scene where she's just, like, hanging about and she's, like, the little kids at the petting zoo and stuff like that. And they try to introduce these sort of, like, sweeter scenes of Southern life. I still think they do it in a condescending way. Yes. But they sort of introduce that whether she goes to, like, the street fair there. I think that is well done. I do think the scene of her, so the situation is that, like, when she goes to see Jake, initially there's this, like, droopy bloodhound looking dog, or maybe he's a basset, I don't remember. And she thinks he's the dog that they had before, Bear. But he says that his name is Bright, and Bear died a few years ago. That was the dog that she had. And I have a question about that soon, but first. And so when she's already at the part of the movie where she's feeling really guilty, about all the things that she's done, you know, justifiably or not, she goes to the pet cemetery where he's buried, and she has this, like, really sweet emotional scene where she's crying, and she's saying she's so sorry she left him. There's a line she has where she's like, you must have just been sitting there wondering what you did wrong. Yeah, it's very sad. Which is like, you know, if anybody's, like, owned a pet, like, that's exactly, like, what you imagine they feel like when you're gone for a while. And it's very sad, because that dog is dead. Yeah. Like, I don't appreciate, I care more about that dog being dead than their pregnancy being lost, to be totally honest. The emotion of that is so raw. I feel terrible about that dog. See, that's part of the problem with the rest of the movie, is that that scene really, really sells the impact in the aftermath of her leaving the way that she did. Good job, Reese. In a way that none of her human interactions does. Yes. Because the humans she's interacting with are terrible. Yeah. None of them have the endearing factor of a dog. But see, that's the problem, is that it's like, the only time I care about the emotional stakes of this is when she's talking about her dead dog. So sad. Like, that you screwed something up. Not because, like, the dog thing isn't sad, but because it's like, the rest of it should have that same impact. Right. And the fact that it didn't mean that you missed something. I honestly think them, because the friends thing is something else. You know, it's a different situation when, like, you're, when you have a lot of friends who still hang out with each other and you're just, like, the one friend who's moved on. Like, that's almost, at least to me, never going to be super, um, endearing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not, yeah, exactly. It's a normal thing that happens, and I'm not going to relate to somebody who's, like, a big grudge about it. But when you're talking about your lost child, that should have more impact. I think they screwed it up so much by having them be just, like, these resentful assholes who don't want to visit their daughter ever. Yeah. That, like, I'm immediately on her side and everything except for when she goes to talk to her dog. Because that is sad. And she's right that, like, that poor dog probably was wondering where his human was. And it was very sad. And it's heartbreaking. Yeah. I'm confused about how long she had the dog. Like, this is just, like, a timeline situation. I'm pretty sure she, Cerise Witherspoon herself is, 26 when she made this movie. I mean, I know the idea she's lived in New York for seven years. No, definitively, she's lived in New York for seven years. She must have moved when she was, like, 1920, let's say. It is definitely her and Jake's dog. Not her family's dog. Right, so how old was that dog? How long did they have that dog before she left? Did they just have him for, like, a year? Because I'm pretty sure she got pregnant at the senior year in high school. I'm pretty sure. Right. I don't think they would have done it that much earlier. Just, you know, to keep things PG for the kids. I don't think they would have had to get pregnant and marry at 15. In Alabama, she could have been, but. But the point is that it's, like, how long, I mean, she would have had to get pregnant at the end of high school for her to leave at 19. Exactly. Because she lingered for three years. So the point is, like, assuming that they got the dog together when they were married, she had the dog for, like, a year, year and a half. And you can absolutely establish a connection. But, like, it just introduced the question of a timeline into my head that I don't think the movie did a really good job of resolving. No, yeah. Of course. But, yeah, why would they care? Why would they make the effort on something like that? I guess. I was honestly expecting you to ask me about what the names of the. Baron Bryant. I know it's some sort of Alabama sports thing. And I'll tell you what, I don't care. No, that's fair enough. So let me ask you this. Would you say that that's the memorable scene for you for this movie? It's interesting. I have a few. Really? Because I watched this movie. No, no, no, no, no. In terms of, like, me now as an adult, that by far is the standout scene. There's not even a question. Yeah. The initial exercise of, like, pick a scene in a movie was me saying, for movies that I watched a lot as a kid and haven't watched in a while, what is the first scene I think of when I think of that movie? I have a few. I have the opening scene that we didn't really talk about with Dakota Fanning playing young Melody and some. Because nothing says rom-com like a hurricane and really weird font choices for the opening credits. And just, like, there's something about it. And it's very, like, divine secret to the Yaya sisterhood-y. Because, like, it's just, like, I don't think it sexualizes them as kids. But it, like, overly romanticizes the idea of, like, they're 10 years old and it's their first kiss and they're going to be together forever. But, like, it's their first kiss. They're kids. He says he's going to marry her. She says, why would you want to marry me anyhow? And he goes, so I could kiss you anytime I want. And then she repeats that later on when they get together. So that's it. I remember just because, like, it's, like you said, it's, like, a striking way to start a movie. It's, like, a thunderstorm and children. It's just unusual. And so that's why I remember that. Not that I think it's particularly well done. I do remember the scene with her saying goodbye to the dog. But the other, not so much scene, but visual I remember. And I do think it's a well-done visual. Is at the very end when, so they're celebrating their getting back together. They still have the wedding cake for her and Andrew's wedding. So they kick off the wedding topper. And the only thing they find are, like, what are those called? Rock of a Sackham robots. Yeah, yeah, the Rock of a Sackham, like, fighting robots. And they put that on. I thought that was, I remember that being a cute thing. It makes no sense. Like, that's the sort of thing where it's, like, okay, like, it's a cute thing in and of itself. But, like, I feel like with something that visually distinct, it needs to have a greater meaning than just, oh, this is a goofy thing we did. And it doesn't at all. Yeah, you know what movie does the better version of that is Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That's what I was going to say, the puppets. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. It's, like, but to me, it's, like, if you're going to make, like, the active effort to have an image like that, it should actually indicate something about the characters. You get on each other's nerves. They fight. But at that point in the movie, they're not fighting anymore. Yeah. I just remember the visual. I agree that contextually, like, it's a shallow joke. They could have put, like, a glass and, like, a photo of, like, a dress or something. Yeah. Like, which would have been really shitty anyway. But, like, that at least is indicative of the characters in some way. Like, the robots then just felt really, like, this goofy. That sounds like something that somebody had the image of. Yeah, they wrote that. And they just put it in there. I think it's cute, though. And they also have the cat. Not the movie. They're giving you these crazy stories. Melanie was, like, an outlaw, right? She would, like. Well, no, that goes back to, like, the overly reductive attitude about, like, poor collar, blue collar people. Yeah. She would, like, steal shit. All those kids were rambunctious. She tipped a cow. That's, like, the most stereotypical thing she could do. Basically, it's assuming, basically, it's acting like, oh, every blue collar kid in this town just, like, did all sorts of, like, criminal bullshit when they were 12. But there's, like, there's a scene. So when Andrew first gets to town, Josh is, like, the first one that sort of sees him is trying to surprise Melanie. And he pretends that he's talking about a different Melanie. Yeah. Because he still thinks, Andrew still thinks that Melanie's last name is Carmichael. So he's talking about this girl, Melanie Smooter, that he was in love with. He's pretending to be Melanie's cousin at this point. It's a complicated little plot line. And he's talking about how when she was little, there was, like, this town cat that everyone loved and he was sick. And they were going to kill him in a way that sounded inhumane. So she decides to just blow him up. Yeah, just. Tie him to a bunch of dynamite and blow him up. But he, like, went into the bank. And blew up the bank. And blew up the bank. And they think the cat himself wriggled away and now roams the town. Yeah. You know, it's been, like, 20 years. So there's no way that cat's still alive. And at the end of the movie, right when they pan out and you see the robot, the Sockham, Rockham robots on the cake, you see, like, this really frizzled looking, clearly burned fur cat licking the cake. It's like, ah, we're going to the supermarket. Supernatural route now because the cat's, like, it's. She is 26 years old. On a couple of levels, that cat would be dead. That story happened when she was, like, 12. Yeah, on a couple of levels. And he was an old-ass cat then. Yeah, on a couple of levels, that cat should be dead. Again, the timeline here is ridiculous. I also think that the music here is. Like, even the music manages to be condescending.", "segments": [{"start": 0.06, "end": 1.02, "text": " She just keeps saying,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [1240, 445, 5965, 1566, 11], "temperature": 0.0,

just keeps saying, like, what have you been doing with your life? You can't play football anymore. Get a new dream. Like, don't you think you would say, like, I fucking have a business. Yeah, I don't get why he. Especially if he's past the point of trying to win her back. Yeah. I don't understand why he keeps it secret before then either. But, like. Let's say this, though. Is that not, like, the most, like, stereotypical rom-com male job? One of my notes is, like, this is, like, the most, in terms of jobs, the most rom-commy stereotype. Fashion designer. It's a pretty rom-commy job. You know? Even if we don't see it that often, just that concept of, like, aspirational. It's creative. Like, she still gets to be professional and kick-ass. And, yes, he has that, like. I mean, that goes back to what I said about, like, Bill Pullman. Yes. It's the same sort of thing where it's, like, oh, this is, like, crafty and creative, but it also is, like, oh, this is totally, like, a. Something to do with your hands. Yeah. And it's manly. But it's also, like, and it's also just incredibly, like, commercial in a way where it's, like, yeah. Yeah. They go to lengths to establish that he has a ton of money. Yeah. And I very cynically was, like, yeah, if they didn't do that, then a lot of people in the theater wouldn't be rooting for them. Because, guys, I've heard a lot of people talk about how moved they are by the scene where she gets engaged to Andrew. Because it's the most stereotypical, like, wish fulfillment thing ever. So, Andrew takes her to Tiffany's. Like, after hours. After hours. And he's just, like, pick any ring you want. And it's fully staffed Tiffany's. Which, for no reason. And they're, like, pulling out rings. They have, like, they have, like, at least one person per counter out of, like, the dozen counters in Tiffany's. Like, why do they all need to be there? Yeah. Like, one guy can pull out a ring. You don't need 13 people. It's more romantic with a big sweeping gesture. But, like, people love that scene so much. Yeah, it's so. That they have to, like, match, like, well, he's rich, too. She's not losing any money if she goes with the other guy. Let's talk about the other guy. Let's talk about. He's fine. Like. I think this is an example of another man's character that is, like I was saying before, sometimes they do it where the guy is perfectly lovely. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. But it's him, too. Yeah. You know what I mean? Primarily, the only problem that he has is that he seems to be a little too excited to, like, stick things to his mother. Yeah. Like, but that's it. Like, that's the whole thing. Like, he says, like, when they decide to have an Alabama wedding. Like, he specifically says, like, can you imagine, like, my mom and all those New York types, like, coming down here? Like, that's, like, that's, like, the one, like, iffy thing is that he always seems really excited to, like, make his mom feel shitty about something. Well, that's also because Melanie hates his mom. I think it's also just, like, kind of, you know, being on her side with that. Maybe, yeah. But, yeah. I don't think that he's, like, aggressively, like, oh, this will really piss mom off. I think he's a fine character. No, no, no. But I would say that's still a minor thing. Yeah. That's the point. It's a good casting for Patrick Dempsey. But, yeah. Like, I appreciate when movies don't have, like, an outright villain as the third in a love triangle. Right. You know what I mean? And this movie does a really good job of that. Apparently, they cut a whole subplot where he had some sort of... A Vanderbilt. Yeah. He had, like, a Vanderbilt after him. You do see that he's engaged to a Vanderbilt, which they included because, like, I think you grow to like Andrew as a character. Especially after he, you know, has come to realize who Melanie actually is and still wants to marry her and agrees to get married in Alabama. Like, he's a dream fiance. Yeah. He is. And I thought that was cool that they sort of established that she could realistically be happy with either choice. Yes. And they do a good job also of sort of... By good job, I mean that they do a good job of giving Melanie dialogue that specifically states that she is conflicted and that she feels that she's equally at home in New York and in Alabama. So, they go to good lengths to show that sort of internal conflict. They don't do it in a particularly subtle way because he just fucking says it. But I appreciate that that's the case. I appreciate that this is a movie that softens as it goes. I think the beginning of it with her family... It's very shrill. It's very almost unwatchable for me. Like, when she's, like, fighting with Jake, he calls the sheriff. She's, like... They're all screaming about the crimes they've committed in the past. Like, it's over the top to a degree that I just kind of am annoyed with. It's a lot of Reese Witherspoon being, like, upset and offended. Yeah, I mean, that's sort of like the shot gas. Yeah, exactly. She does that more in this movie than she did in Legally Blonde somehow. Like, even though Legally Blonde, like... She's a much better character in Legally Blonde. Well, yes, but... Let's not kid ourselves. But also because, like, I feel like... Let's not... Pull that rubric out. Every movie fails in comparison to Legally Blonde. I'm just saying it's surprising because that's sort of, like, surface-level affectation you could easily see applying to a character like Elle Woods. Yeah, but no, they... Elle Woods is awesome. Well, yeah, exactly. Anywho... Now, Andrew's mother, on the other hand... What the fuck is that character? Yeah. So, I just want to take a moment to tell Candace Bergen that she's welcome on our show at any time because I would like to give her a hug, sort of present, always this character. And I don't understand why she had a fucking sitcom devoted to her that was iconic, that was nothing like this. But for some reason, they decided Candace Bergen in movies is always the bitch that gets in the protagonist's way. Always. Sometimes she's a murderer if we're talking about this congeniality. But, like... Sorry for the spoiler. But, like, why do this to Candace Bergen? I don't understand why she's all... I mean, she's good at playing this. But why can't she ever be a good person in a movie? Her character is the mayor of... For no reason. Again, I can't... This is enough how weird it is to watch the movie during the election. Because I'm like, is she supposed to be like a Hillary? Probably. I'm saying... I'm thinking maybe not. And I'm just reading it that way. I'm just reading right after Hillary became, like, senator from New York. Not mayor, though. But it's still the same thing. I don't know. I mean, the larger point... They seem like a Kennedy family more than anything else. The larger point is that the political backdrop for this movie is completely unnecessary. There is no reason for them to be a political family in any way. They could just be generic New York socialites. There is no reason for her to be mayor. There is no reason for her to be the secretary of housing. They introduced stakes through the political platform. Only vaguely. Well, that's why the press is interested in them. I mean, but the whole argument is that, like, oh, like, they would be interested in him regardless because he's, like, the heir to, like... If he was the heir to a wealthy family, if he was male Paris Hilton, like, people would still care. Yeah, but I feel like there's less sort of... I don't know. I feel like there's less on the line if it's not, like, a political thing. I mean, to be honest, I didn't find those stakes compelling in the first place. I don't think that people are that interested in any of this shit when it comes to politics. I mean, they're not super compelling. They also, like, didn't really... Like, she's not running. You know what I mean? She's in office. They do bring up that she wants him to run for president. Which in and of itself I find annoying. Because it's like, why is she more concerned about his chances? She should run for president. I know. I think that, too. Why is she more bothered by his... She keeps calling him the future president. I'm like, but you're mayor of New York. You could run for president now. And that's what I thought she was going for because at first she says, like, he used to date this woman who was a San Francisco lawyer and she says that's perfect. Which makes no sense. I know you'll get to it. But, like, I thought they were getting to the fact that, like, she wants to build a political family so that she can run for president. Right. But she keeps on talking about him running for president. She talks about his dad and how he was, like, a politician. But they never establish how. Or what happened to him. We don't know if he's dead or if they divorced. She killed him. Of course. Killery, right? But, like, she... Which... That's the thing. The assumption would be that he's dead, right? Because no woman in politics... She could survive being, like, being a divorcee. Yeah. Like, that's not a thing that happens. Well, like, if his dad was, in fact, a politician, like, they imply that he was. Right. But they don't build it for sure. Like, they would bring him up, you know, either attending the wedding or bring up that he's not attending the wedding. Right. I'm pretty sure he has died. Yeah. And she's just like, your asshole father cheated on me all the time. Yeah, maybe she is supposed to be a Hillary. I'm sure she is. But, like... That makes me even more uncomfortable. I mean, isn't it drives me nuts, though? I mean, about that California thing. Because, like, I mean, she says, like, oh, he used to date this woman from California. All those electoral votes. Yeah, she has all those electoral votes. And it's like, I'm pretty sure any Democrat from New York is running for president. You get in California, lady. I don't think you have to worry about that. Yeah. It makes more political sense for him to marry someone from the South. Yeah. Because, like, those are electoral votes you wouldn't get otherwise. What a dumbass. Like, it's like, you're not even good at the fake politics that you needlessly practice in the background of this movie. I also, again, want to bring up the fact that, like, she gets involved in the wedding planning. She suggests. She suggests using the plantation as where they should get married. A Democrat who was in a seat earlier worried about, like, her connection to the Confederacy is like, you know, you should get married? Slave house. See, that's the thing. Like, as a real life example, by the way, I'm pretty sure Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively still get shit because they got married at a plantation. And Paula Deen had a problem. Well, that was not just a plantation. No, that went further. But I know, I know. She leaned into it. I know. But, no, like, politically speaking, you're not going to get married anywhere that glorifies the antebellum South. Yeah, you can't get away with that. It's unreal. So, yeah. So, like, that whole, that whole plot, that whole backdrop, it doesn't really add anything except annoyance. And it's vaguely sexist, in my opinion. Probably. Mostly because I use the context of, like, them always using Hannes Bergen in this. So, like, I have a hair trigger for it. But it's like, it's a way, especially when I talked about, like, oh, it's cool how they don't pit the men against each other and the guy, her fiance is still a decent stand-up guy. They still find a way to make this movie a story about one woman pitted against another woman. Yeah, right. Like, her antagonist is a powerful New York woman. Like, why? Yeah. Like, why is that even necessary at all? Her mother hating her, Andrew's mother hating her adds nothing to the plot. It adds, like, a few complications. She sends a private detective down and she has to pretend to be a Carmichael for a while and shit like that. But it's very vague. It's, like, it doesn't add much to the plot. It's not very funny. It's incidental. And it takes away from the movie more than it assists the movie. Yeah, for sure. And I'm just so tired. Give Candace Bergen something better to do. She gets to play slightly different shades of it in Sex and the City, but it's still this character who's, like, an authority figure and is negative and making fun of the hotter, younger woman. I'm like, why? I ask you, why? Why do this to Murphy Brown? It's not fair. I agree. And Candace Bergen is really, really funny. Yeah. Is there anything else? I think I'm out. So, like I said, I like the scene. Like I said, I like that the movie softens as it goes, though. Specifically, I think that it does do a pretty good job of sort of showing this feeling that you get if you, like, live, if you've, like, moved on from the place where you maybe were born or spent your childhood or grew up and you come back, even if you have, like, negative feelings about that place, there are certain things that just, like, nostalgia will get at you. I get that, like, I get, like, that weird feeling if I go back to Israel. Like, I don't like it there, but once in a while, like, I'll walk down the street that I remember from when I was little and be like, oh, remember? I used to go on this ride. And I think they do a good job of that, especially when she goes to, like, the carnival, the scene where she's just, like, hanging about and she's, like, the little kids at the petting zoo and stuff like that. And they try to introduce these sort of, like, sweeter scenes of Southern life. I still think they do it in a condescending way. Yes. But they sort of introduce that whether she goes to, like, the street fair there. I think that is well done. I do think the scene of her, so the situation is that, like, when she goes to see Jake, initially there's this, like, droopy bloodhound looking dog, or maybe he's a basset, I don't remember. And she thinks he's the dog that they had before, Bear. But he says that his name is Bright, and Bear died a few years ago. That was the dog that she had. And I have a question about that soon, but first. And so when she's already at the part of the movie where she's feeling really guilty, about all the things that she's done, you know, justifiably or not, she goes to the pet cemetery where he's buried, and she has this, like, really sweet emotional scene where she's crying, and she's saying she's so sorry she left him. There's a line she has where she's like, you must have just been sitting there wondering what you did wrong. Yeah, it's very sad. Which is like, you know, if anybody's, like, owned a pet, like, that's exactly, like, what you imagine they feel like when you're gone for a while. And it's very sad, because that dog is dead. Yeah. Like, I don't appreciate, I care more about that dog being dead than their pregnancy being lost, to be totally honest. The emotion of that is so raw. I feel terrible about that dog. See, that's part of the problem with the rest of the movie, is that that scene really, really sells the impact in the aftermath of her leaving the way that she did. Good job, Reese. In a way that none of her human interactions does. Yes. Because the humans she's interacting with are terrible. Yeah. None of them have the endearing factor of a dog. But see, that's the problem, is that it's like, the only time I care about the emotional stakes of this is when she's talking about her dead dog. So sad. Like, that you screwed something up. Not because, like, the dog thing isn't sad, but because it's like, the rest of it should have that same impact. Right. And the fact that it didn't mean that you missed something. I honestly think them, because the friends thing is something else. You know, it's a different situation when, like, you're, when you have a lot of friends who still hang out with each other and you're just, like, the one friend who's moved on. Like, that's almost, at least to me, never going to be super, um, endearing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not, yeah, exactly. It's a normal thing that happens, and I'm not going to relate to somebody who's, like, a big grudge about it. But when you're talking about your lost child, that should have more impact. I think they screwed it up so much by having them be just, like, these resentful assholes who don't want to visit their daughter ever. Yeah. That, like, I'm immediately on her side and everything except for when she goes to talk to her dog. Because that is sad. And she's right that, like, that poor dog probably was wondering where his human was. And it was very sad. And it's heartbreaking. Yeah. I'm confused about how long she had the dog. Like, this is just, like, a timeline situation. I'm pretty sure she, Cerise Witherspoon herself is, 26 when she made this movie. I mean, I know the idea she's lived in New York for seven years. No, definitively, she's lived in New York for seven years. She must have moved when she was, like, 1920, let's say. It is definitely her and Jake's dog. Not her family's dog. Right, so how old was that dog? How long did they have that dog before she left? Did they just have him for, like, a year? Because I'm pretty sure she got pregnant at the senior year in high school. I'm pretty sure. Right. I don't think they would have done it that much earlier. Just, you know, to keep things PG for the kids. I don't think they would have had to get pregnant and marry at 15. In Alabama, she could have been, but. But the point is that it's, like, how long, I mean, she would have had to get pregnant at the end of high school for her to leave at 19. Exactly. Because she lingered for three years. So the point is, like, assuming that they got the dog together when they were married, she had the dog for, like, a year, year and a half. And you can absolutely establish a connection. But, like, it just introduced the question of a timeline into my head that I don't think the movie did a really good job of resolving. No, yeah. Of course. But, yeah, why would they care? Why would they make the effort on something like that? I guess. I was honestly expecting you to ask me about what the names of the. Baron Bryant. I know it's some sort of Alabama sports thing. And I'll tell you what, I don't care. No, that's fair enough. So let me ask you this. Would you say that that's the memorable scene for you for this movie? It's interesting. I have a few. Really? Because I watched this movie. No, no, no, no, no. In terms of, like, me now as an adult, that by far is the standout scene. There's not even a question. Yeah. The initial exercise of, like, pick a scene in a movie was me saying, for movies that I watched a lot as a kid and haven't watched in a while, what is the first scene I think of when I think of that movie? I have a few. I have the opening scene that we didn't really talk about with Dakota Fanning playing young Melody and some. Because nothing says rom-com like a hurricane and really weird font choices for the opening credits. And just, like, there's something about it. And it's very, like, divine secret to the Yaya sisterhood-y. Because, like, it's just, like, I don't think it sexualizes them as kids. But it, like, overly romanticizes the idea of, like, they're 10 years old and it's their first kiss and they're going to be together forever. But, like, it's their first kiss. They're kids. He says he's going to marry her. She says, why would you want to marry me anyhow? And he goes, so I could kiss you anytime I want. And then she repeats that later on when they get together. So that's it. I remember just because, like, it's, like you said, it's, like, a striking way to start a movie. It's, like, a thunderstorm and children. It's just unusual. And so that's why I remember that. Not that I think it's particularly well done. I do remember the scene with her saying goodbye to the dog. But the other, not so much scene, but visual I remember. And I do think it's a well-done visual. Is at the very end when, so they're celebrating their getting back together. They still have the wedding cake for her and Andrew's wedding. So they kick off the wedding topper. And the only thing they find are, like, what are those called? Rock of a Sackham robots. Yeah, yeah, the Rock of a Sackham, like, fighting robots. And they put that on. I thought that was, I remember that being a cute thing. It makes no sense. Like, that's the sort of thing where it's, like, okay, like, it's a cute thing in and of itself. But, like, I feel like with something that visually distinct, it needs to have a greater meaning than just, oh, this is a goofy thing we did. And it doesn't at all. Yeah, you know what movie does the better version of that is Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That's what I was going to say, the puppets. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. It's, like, but to me, it's, like, if you're going to make, like, the active effort to have an image like that, it should actually indicate something about the characters. You get on each other's nerves. They fight. But at that point in the movie, they're not fighting anymore. Yeah. I just remember the visual. I agree that contextually, like, it's a shallow joke. They could have put, like, a glass and, like, a photo of, like, a dress or something. Yeah. Like, which would have been really shitty anyway. But, like, that at least is indicative of the characters in some way. Like, the robots then just felt really, like, this goofy. That sounds like something that somebody had the image of. Yeah, they wrote that. And they just put it in there. I think it's cute, though. And they also have the cat. Not the movie. They're giving you these crazy stories. Melanie was, like, an outlaw, right? She would, like. Well, no, that goes back to, like, the overly reductive attitude about, like, poor collar, blue collar people. Yeah. She would, like, steal shit. All those kids were rambunctious. She tipped a cow. That's, like, the most stereotypical thing she could do. Basically, it's assuming, basically, it's acting like, oh, every blue collar kid in this town just, like, did all sorts of, like, criminal bullshit when they were 12. But there's, like, there's a scene. So when Andrew first gets to town, Josh is, like, the first one that sort of sees him is trying to surprise Melanie. And he pretends that he's talking about a different Melanie. Yeah. Because he still thinks, Andrew still thinks that Melanie's last name is Carmichael. So he's talking about this girl, Melanie Smooter, that he was in love with. He's pretending to be Melanie's cousin at this point. It's a complicated little plot line. And he's talking about how when she was little, there was, like, this town cat that everyone loved and he was sick. And they were going to kill him in a way that sounded inhumane. So she decides to just blow him up. Yeah, just. Tie him to a bunch of dynamite and blow him up. But he, like, went into the bank. And blew up the bank. And blew up the bank. And they think the cat himself wriggled away and now roams the town. Yeah. You know, it's been, like, 20 years. So there's no way that cat's still alive. And at the end of the movie, right when they pan out and you see the robot, the Sockham, Rockham robots on the cake, you see, like, this really frizzled looking, clearly burned fur cat licking the cake. It's like, ah, we're going to the supermarket. Supernatural route now because the cat's, like, it's. She is 26 years old. On a couple of levels, that cat would be dead. That story happened when she was, like, 12. Yeah, on a couple of levels. And he was an old-ass cat then. Yeah, on a couple of levels, that cat should be dead. Again, the timeline here is ridiculous. I also think that the music here is. Like, even the music manages to be condescending.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.06, "end": 2.18, "text": " She just keeps saying, like, what have you been doing with your life?", "seek": 0.0,
