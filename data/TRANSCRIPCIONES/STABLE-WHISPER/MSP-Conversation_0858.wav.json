{"text": " Hold on, let me drop you there. There, dropped. Okay, so we're back to this. Our labs, they are doing something fantastic this weekend. 2,000 people, we're talking about youth here who'll be entertained and given the opportunity to be creative, to be educated, and to just have fun and do what youth is supposed to do, all right? Also, it's gonna happen between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. This is the information that I have, but that's why I brought in the experts to give you more. I heard that Jimmy Nevis and Reddy D, they're gonna be the headliners. Very excited about that because you've got a bit of 7-7-6-4 and a bit of... with Reddy D as well. And then, there's also something behind this which is even more amazing, and that's why I brought in people with very, very long titles. Let me just start here with Alan Funder-Mierlen from our labs, the project coordinator extraordinaire and youth ambassadorial individual that caters for everybody. Alan Funder-Mierlen, say youth if that's you. Youth. By a donkey word. Moving along swiftly, we've got the woman empowerment facilitator who believes that women have the power. I've got the power. Suzanne Smith is here. Say youth if that's you, Suzanne Smith. Youth. That's what I'm talking about. And then, we also have Daylon Jacobs. This guy is the media manager. We don't know if he manages, but he knows media. It's Daylon Jacobs. Say youth if that's you. Youth. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. Let's start from the beginning. Suzanne Smith, woman empowerment facilitator, our labs. What is that? Our labs? Our labs is an organization that started about, say, seven years ago. Obviously, we didn't know that this is what our labs was going to look like. So, our labs started with about seven or eight guys from a community, ex-gangsters, ex-drug dealers. So, the founder, Marlon Parker, saw the potential within these guys that they are able to change the lives, not only of them, but also of the community. The idea was never to have our labs where we go out to communities and do training. It was mostly just to reconstruct our young people within our communities. And where it started, where Marlon Parker gave computer lessons to some of the guys on campus. And it went from that, where these guys that were ex-drug addicts and gangsters in the communities now brought their parents and their moms to do social media training at our labs. Our labs started in a red, small room. I still, I remember this day, clearly, Marlon always explains it like about the paint that they had to buy for the room. It wasn't supposed to be red, you know. It was supposed to be orange. They wanted to paint it orange. They bought the wrong paint. And he wanted to take it away the Monday. And when he came in, the one wall was painted red already. And the next day he came in, the other wall was also painted red. And they just left the room red. And the floors was also other color. And they had like red Dell laptops. And I think there's where also the logo came from. The Our Labs logo that's red and black and white. Because of the room that was painted red. And there was sponsored red Dell laptops. So yes, Our Labs is an organization for people, by people. And it basically started on the K-Plats with young men and women from the K-Plats. That is incredible. There's something in that story about the paint. I'll tell you why. Because the red, it may have been a mistake. But it shows you that you can make mistakes. Yes. But you can still make something of it. Definitely. And I think that's the magic in Our Labs as well. I love this story. Suzanne Smith, woman, empowerment facilitator. I have to get the title right. But let's move on to Alan Van der Miel. And this man is the project coordinator. I'd just like to know, so this weekend it's all about youth being facilitated and also just empowered. But tell me about the fourth generation I keep hearing about. I've heard about them as the millennials. So these are the young people that grew up in the age of technology. These are the guys who you can hand a smartphone to and they'll be able to reset your password or wipe your phone without you blinking an eye. So the fourth generation are the generation that we're trying to target. Because a lot of the industrial revolution happened like 50 years ago when computers first came out. And we feel like the guys who are going to lead this is that fourth generation. So these are the people who spend their free time learning, watching YouTube videos and how to do coding. These are the guys who just basically love technology. These are the millennials. These are the people born, the young at heart people as well. The young at heart people as well. Of course. Like me. Yes, yes. Like you. Like you. But these are people. Thank you. Yeah. But these are people that really love technology and can actually use the internet to not only better their lives but also create their own sort of future. And that is the generation that we're trying to capture. The fourth generation. The fourth generation. So why do an event like this from nine till four today? Well, we actually want to give them the opportunity to learn about the fourth industrial revolution because a lot of things are changing, you know, like the internet speed compared to how it was back in the day. I heard rumors of this dial-up modem that would take like five minutes and print one picture. But now we have people being able to stream movies online that they paid for and all those sorts of things. But now we want to educate these people as to the technologies that surrounds the fourth industrial revolution. So they can actually be prepared for it. Because we all know what it feels like to be an adult who just got a new smartphone trying to type with one finger and not make that much mistakes. Nothing wrong with typing with one finger. No, nothing. I guess nothing wrong. I stand corrected. But I get you. So it's about moving with the times. Yes. But in the same time, using the vehicle of our context, which is technology. Exactly. To empower, enlighten and also educate the future, which is very important. So give me the venue for this event. And give me the... Let's go to Daylon Jacobs, the media manager extraordinaire. So give me the venue of this event. And also, you plan to cater for 2,000 youth. Where are you planning to get them from? Yeah. So firstly, the venue for this event, it's obviously Spine Road High School Hall. Yeah. And just before I tell you where we're getting our participants from and these kind of things, is that we're actually to the people that's coming to the event. Yes. If they're existing Uber users, riders, we actually have a code available where they will get 50% off on their two rides. But there's only two and from the venue. Okay. So I'll post onto the R-Labs page or the Twitter account during the show. Obviously, I'll post the link and the code as well. So the people that's coming to the event, they can see. And where we're getting our participants from is obviously our R-Labs champions. They are going out to schools. Yeah. And they are informing schools about the whole event and everything around it. And they are doing pre-registration for the event. So we're actually going to these young people. Instead of just telling them, come to our offices and register, we are now actually going to them because we know this is something that they actually need. And they are the people that's going to actually change the future because they are the ones that are using technology on a daily basis. I mean, today, we don't just knock on the door anymore. We stand in front of the gate and we send a message to say, I'm outside. Open or come out. I'm outside. So that's the generation. And obviously, what we are doing is we have a link online where youth groups and these kind of people can actually sign up, register. They're young people because this is actually one of the things that they need to do in order for them to get access to food for the day. I mean, we need to serve people if we're having them that long. And our partners for this event is obviously KFM. Yes. That's right. That's right, KFM. Media24, Zuna, and then obviously ShopRite will be providing the food for the day or the snacks for the day, which is... And that's our partners. I don't know if that answers your question. That answers everything. You answered questions I didn't even ask you, which I appreciate. That's what I'm talking about. That's why you're the media manager. That's the fourth generation. You see? He read all of that from his phone, which is technology and part of the fourth generation, which makes a lot of sense. So let's just give it a nice little sum up for a second. I'm youth Spine Road High School, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. I want to be there. I know Jimmy Nevis is going to be there. I know Reddy D is going to be there. What other things can I expect when I walk into the Spine Road High School hall? Okay. So obviously before the whole Jimmy Nevis, DJ Reddy D, and obviously there's a third artist as well, Spyro, and he's... Also from the 6-4. Oh. Yes, he's also from the 6-4. And before this event, before they actually... So that's how we're ending the event. But before that, we actually have an unconference, which is focusing on four different areas, learning. So we would like to give these young people learning experience. And we have four different focus points, which is an inspirational stage, obviously. And what we're doing is the youth will be inspired with some fire chats, generation peers, so people that they can relate to. And it's like five-minute talks, which is, you know... Thank goodness. Because the attention span of the fourth generation is 140 characters. Yes, and that's Twitter, right? There we go. Yeah. So that's one of the things. And also, there's going to be more of a fourth Industrial Revolution studio. So there they'll focus on, you know, your 3D printing, your virtual reality, your artificial intelligence. Nice. All of these, you know, big words that Alan will explain to us shortly, if you need us to explain that. No, no, I'm good, I'm good. Yeah. And also a creation lab, which is the youth will have the opportunity to actually create new ideas and concepts, addressing the whole future of work using design thinking methodologies and new technologies. And then the last one is activate, where we just give them the opportunity to activate a next step as their journey in being change agents in their communities and schools. Yeah. Amazing stuff, though. So if... I missed all of that because we've got some great facts out of you guys, and I appreciate you being here to give us more info. I know when I said Jermaine Avest and Reddy D, people got excited like, where, where, where? But there's something more to this, though. If I need an online resource, where do I go for more information so I can make a good decision and visit you on Saturday, 17 June? So any youth groups and things that I would like to register, they can obviously email events at rlabs.org. Yes. And then obviously through our social media pages and stuff like that, they can just drop us a message if they need the link. However, the link will be up on the page later today. So they can actually register from the Uber code that will be used on Saturday. Cool. That's up already on the Facebook page. So I'll just tweet that on Twitter so they can actually see that as well. Lovely stuff. Media manager, Daylon Jacobs, that was the man's voice. He's got that huskiness. I like that. Also, Alan Van der Meulen joining us, the project coordinator and Suzanne Smith, the woman empowerment facilitator. The guys have a fantastic event on Saturday, 17 June at Spiron High School. And if you want to register for this incredible event, all you have to do is just email events at rlabs.org.", "segments": [{"start": 0.02, "end": 1.04, "text": " Hold on, let me drop you there.",

There, dropped. Okay, so we're back to this. Our labs, they are doing something fantastic this weekend. 2,000 people, we're talking about youth here who'll be entertained and given the opportunity to be creative, to be educated, and to just have fun and do what youth is supposed to do, all right? Also, it's gonna happen between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. This is the information that I have, but that's why I brought in the experts to give you more. I heard that Jimmy Nevis and Reddy D, they're gonna be the headliners. Very excited about that because you've got a bit of 7-7-6-4 and a bit of... with Reddy D as well. And then, there's also something behind this which is even more amazing, and that's why I brought in people with very, very long titles. Let me just start here with Alan Funder-Mierlen from our labs, the project coordinator extraordinaire and youth ambassadorial individual that caters for everybody. Alan Funder-Mierlen, say youth if that's you. Youth. By a donkey word. Moving along swiftly, we've got the woman empowerment facilitator who believes that women have the power. I've got the power. Suzanne Smith is here. Say youth if that's you, Suzanne Smith. Youth. That's what I'm talking about. And then, we also have Daylon Jacobs. This guy is the media manager. We don't know if he manages, but he knows media. It's Daylon Jacobs. Say youth if that's you. Youth. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. Let's start from the beginning. Suzanne Smith, woman empowerment facilitator, our labs. What is that? Our labs? Our labs is an organization that started about, say, seven years ago. Obviously, we didn't know that this is what our labs was going to look like. So, our labs started with about seven or eight guys from a community, ex-gangsters, ex-drug dealers. So, the founder, Marlon Parker, saw the potential within these guys that they are able to change the lives, not only of them, but also of the community. The idea was never to have our labs where we go out to communities and do training. It was mostly just to reconstruct our young people within our communities. And where it started, where Marlon Parker gave computer lessons to some of the guys on campus. And it went from that, where these guys that were ex-drug addicts and gangsters in the communities now brought their parents and their moms to do social media training at our labs. Our labs started in a red, small room. I still, I remember this day, clearly, Marlon always explains it like about the paint that they had to buy for the room. It wasn't supposed to be red, you know. It was supposed to be orange. They wanted to paint it orange. They bought the wrong paint. And he wanted to take it away the Monday. And when he came in, the one wall was painted red already. And the next day he came in, the other wall was also painted red. And they just left the room red. And the floors was also other color. And they had like red Dell laptops. And I think there's where also the logo came from. The Our Labs logo that's red and black and white. Because of the room that was painted red. And there was sponsored red Dell laptops. So yes, Our Labs is an organization for people, by people. And it basically started on the K-Plats with young men and women from the K-Plats. That is incredible. There's something in that story about the paint. I'll tell you why. Because the red, it may have been a mistake. But it shows you that you can make mistakes. Yes. But you can still make something of it. Definitely. And I think that's the magic in Our Labs as well. I love this story. Suzanne Smith, woman, empowerment facilitator. I have to get the title right. But let's move on to Alan Van der Miel. And this man is the project coordinator. I'd just like to know, so this weekend it's all about youth being facilitated and also just empowered. But tell me about the fourth generation I keep hearing about. I've heard about them as the millennials. So these are the young people that grew up in the age of technology. These are the guys who you can hand a smartphone to and they'll be able to reset your password or wipe your phone without you blinking an eye. So the fourth generation are the generation that we're trying to target. Because a lot of the industrial revolution happened like 50 years ago when computers first came out. And we feel like the guys who are going to lead this is that fourth generation. So these are the people who spend their free time learning, watching YouTube videos and how to do coding. These are the guys who just basically love technology. These are the millennials. These are the people born, the young at heart people as well. The young at heart people as well. Of course. Like me. Yes, yes. Like you. Like you. But these are people. Thank you. Yeah. But these are people that really love technology and can actually use the internet to not only better their lives but also create their own sort of future. And that is the generation that we're trying to capture. The fourth generation. The fourth generation. So why do an event like this from nine till four today? Well, we actually want to give them the opportunity to learn about the fourth industrial revolution because a lot of things are changing, you know, like the internet speed compared to how it was back in the day. I heard rumors of this dial-up modem that would take like five minutes and print one picture. But now we have people being able to stream movies online that they paid for and all those sorts of things. But now we want to educate these people as to the technologies that surrounds the fourth industrial revolution. So they can actually be prepared for it. Because we all know what it feels like to be an adult who just got a new smartphone trying to type with one finger and not make that much mistakes. Nothing wrong with typing with one finger. No, nothing. I guess nothing wrong. I stand corrected. But I get you. So it's about moving with the times. Yes. But in the same time, using the vehicle of our context, which is technology. Exactly. To empower, enlighten and also educate the future, which is very important. So give me the venue for this event. And give me the... Let's go to Daylon Jacobs, the media manager extraordinaire. So give me the venue of this event. And also, you plan to cater for 2,000 youth. Where are you planning to get them from? Yeah. So firstly, the venue for this event, it's obviously Spine Road High School Hall. Yeah. And just before I tell you where we're getting our participants from and these kind of things, is that we're actually to the people that's coming to the event. Yes. If they're existing Uber users, riders, we actually have a code available where they will get 50% off on their two rides. But there's only two and from the venue. Okay. So I'll post onto the R-Labs page or the Twitter account during the show. Obviously, I'll post the link and the code as well. So the people that's coming to the event, they can see. And where we're getting our participants from is obviously our R-Labs champions. They are going out to schools. Yeah. And they are informing schools about the whole event and everything around it. And they are doing pre-registration for the event. So we're actually going to these young people. Instead of just telling them, come to our offices and register, we are now actually going to them because we know this is something that they actually need. And they are the people that's going to actually change the future because they are the ones that are using technology on a daily basis. I mean, today, we don't just knock on the door anymore. We stand in front of the gate and we send a message to say, I'm outside. Open or come out. I'm outside. So that's the generation. And obviously, what we are doing is we have a link online where youth groups and these kind of people can actually sign up, register. They're young people because this is actually one of the things that they need to do in order for them to get access to food for the day. I mean, we need to serve people if we're having them that long. And our partners for this event is obviously KFM. Yes. That's right. That's right, KFM. Media24, Zuna, and then obviously ShopRite will be providing the food for the day or the snacks for the day, which is... And that's our partners. I don't know if that answers your question. That answers everything. You answered questions I didn't even ask you, which I appreciate. That's what I'm talking about. That's why you're the media manager. That's the fourth generation. You see? He read all of that from his phone, which is technology and part of the fourth generation, which makes a lot of sense. So let's just give it a nice little sum up for a second. I'm youth Spine Road High School, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. I want to be there. I know Jimmy Nevis is going to be there. I know Reddy D is going to be there. What other things can I expect when I walk into the Spine Road High School hall? Okay. So obviously before the whole Jimmy Nevis, DJ Reddy D, and obviously there's a third artist as well, Spyro, and he's... Also from the 6-4. Oh. Yes, he's also from the 6-4. And before this event, before they actually... So that's how we're ending the event. But before that, we actually have an unconference, which is focusing on four different areas, learning. So we would like to give these young people learning experience. And we have four different focus points, which is an inspirational stage, obviously. And what we're doing is the youth will be inspired with some fire chats, generation peers, so people that they can relate to. And it's like five-minute talks, which is, you know... Thank goodness. Because the attention span of the fourth generation is 140 characters. Yes, and that's Twitter, right? There we go. Yeah. So that's one of the things. And also, there's going to be more of a fourth Industrial Revolution studio. So there they'll focus on, you know, your 3D printing, your virtual reality, your artificial intelligence. Nice. All of these, you know, big words that Alan will explain to us shortly, if you need us to explain that. No, no, I'm good, I'm good. Yeah. And also a creation lab, which is the youth will have the opportunity to actually create new ideas and concepts, addressing the whole future of work using design thinking methodologies and new technologies. And then the last one is activate, where we just give them the opportunity to activate a next step as their journey in being change agents in their communities and schools. Yeah. Amazing stuff, though. So if... I missed all of that because we've got some great facts out of you guys, and I appreciate you being here to give us more info. I know when I said Jermaine Avest and Reddy D, people got excited like, where, where, where? But there's something more to this, though. If I need an online resource, where do I go for more information so I can make a good decision and visit you on Saturday, 17 June? So any youth groups and things that I would like to register, they can obviously email events at rlabs.org. Yes. And then obviously through our social media pages and stuff like that, they can just drop us a message if they need the link. However, the link will be up on the page later today. So they can actually register from the Uber code that will be used on Saturday. Cool. That's up already on the Facebook page. So I'll just tweet that on Twitter so they can actually see that as well. Lovely stuff. Media manager, Daylon Jacobs, that was the man's voice. He's got that huskiness. I like that. Also, Alan Van der Meulen joining us, the project coordinator and Suzanne Smith, the woman empowerment facilitator. The guys have a fantastic event on Saturday, 17 June at Spiron High School. And if you want to register for this incredible event, all you have to do is just email events at rlabs.org.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.02, "end": 1.04, "text": " Hold on, let me drop you
