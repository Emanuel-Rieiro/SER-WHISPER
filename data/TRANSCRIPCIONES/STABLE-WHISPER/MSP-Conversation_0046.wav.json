{"text": " And this is for our listenership? Yes. Excellent. Well, what a surprise. It's 1 o'clock Central Time. Welcome to our show, Cinema Fireside, where we speak about all things film. In our studio, we have our great, great colleague, Zav LaPley. On the phone, we are expecting Gabe Van Handel and yours truly. My name is Mark Borchardt. As we begin the show, I just want to thank again Zav LaPley for running this show, running the Riverwest radio outfit, and so on and so forth. It's a nexus of the Milwaukee community. It's a cultural icon, and without it, Milwaukee would have a void in its heart that would not be too cool in any regard. This is a meeting place of good souls, intellectual exchanges, spirited conversations, so on and so forth. And Zav LaPley is the glue that holds it all together. He certainly has many colleagues, true hearts that assist him, and so on and so forth. But he certainly is at the helm of this. And Gabe is back in Milwaukee from Florida, but he's a hardworking man above and beyond the arts, so we're waiting for that ring. Mm-hmm. And... Yeah, it's like we're going back in the old days of when Gabe was in Florida and we were in Milwaukee. Yes, it does have an echo of that memory. And he called in every week. Oh, wow, interesting. Yeah, so today's show, we're going to be talking about Andy Milligan, the work of Andy Milligan. Right, Mark? Yes, and Zav will dutifully explain all things Andy Milligan now. Just an inside joke, I think. Mm-hmm. Well, okay, Andy Milligan is a very low-budget filmmaker, and I came across him in one of my numerous books. This was a cult book listing many films and a company, made by many dramatic still photos, black and whites. And one of them was of the ghastly ones, and it looked pretty intriguing. And I saw that Andy Milligan was the filmmaker, and I also noticed that it was shot on 16mm. So I was absolutely intrigued by that premise. And through the good graces of Riverwest Film and Video, I got to rent that film, and it was... Actually, I will ally Andy Milligan with producer David S. Friedman, who I have a collection of some of his short films. Friedman's not a director but a producer, but he makes films along the likes of Andy Milligan. He's really low-budget films, and I think with David S. Friedman, you know, there's definitely a bit of the artistic imagination in them as opposed to something like the ABC movie of the week. And I always kind of categorize the ABC movie of the week as a template for very basic marginal filmmaking, where the story comes first, and the story is not to be dissuaded by any cinematic pyrotechnics, such as, you know, bizarre low angles, disconcerting fisheye lens, you know, none of that avant-garde stuff that would distract from the fundamental formula of a prosaic film. Whereas filmmakers or producers such as David S. Friedman, and all those filmmakers, they kind of said, hey, you know, we've got nothing to lose. We're not working for a studio. We love film. You know, let's see where our imagination takes us. And that's not allowed in the studio system because that's more of a very mercenary, monetary machine mechanism. And when you have nothing financially to lose, really, you can, you know, let the imagination go free, and that's one of the joys of these this milieu of underground filmmaking is to see these, all of these imaginative tangents, you know, with a selection of lens, different ways of shooting at angles, so on and so forth. And also, you know, you don't have a lot of professional actors and actresses. You have maybe people from the local theater, or you just maybe have family and friends, people off the streets, or people who just dig hanging around and like being in films. So when you watch these movies, you think about who are these people? What are their lives like? You know, what do they do? You know, because these are lives lived on a margin. So when you see these films, you have that periphery of curiosity that just starts to brew, you know, frame by frame as, wait, whose house is that? Whose house are they shooting in? You know, what, where did they get that muscle car? You know, who owns it? You know, did they give them a case of beer to use it that day? And all of that backstory has just got to be utterly fascinating. And as I speak, there we go. There you have it. I love it. You were saying, as you speak? As we speak. The phone rang. So, that being said, I had a minor inconvenience at work, in between shifts, and then had to, I was stuck in the basement. There's no reception whatsoever at a parking garage. Good God. South Korea, where you can get internet service and phone service. It's a mile, like, literally, like, I think, like, two levels below the ground anywhere in the country. So, much different here. Anyway, I'm calling in. Sorry for being a little bit late here. And the cancer rate has doubled. So, yeah, Mark was just introducing the show, Gabe, and talking about some of the charms of an Andy Miller film. Milligan-esque style filmmaking. A filmmaking that, where it's pulled together by elements that, whatever, kind of, whatever you can get together, local actors, local locations, getting someone's restaurant for a scene, getting someone to lend you their muscle car for a shot, and then some of the charm that comes with that. But go ahead, Gabe, and introduce your side to this show today. Well, how I became acquainted with Milligan was, I was, I found a book of his a couple years ago, about, I think it was seven or eight years ago, and something just told me to read it, that it had to be, it had to be read. It just, something about it stuck out. It's called The Ghastly One. And it's written by, I can't remember the name of the author. I gave the book to another friend of mine several years ago. And, oh, pardon me. And passed that along. But it was written by a friend of his who was a journalist, freelance journalist. And it was written over about two, the course of about two decades. And the friend of his sort of became acquainted with him through a friend of a friend of a friend. And thought he was a rather interesting person. And when he found out that he was, like, had been a filmmaker on 42nd Street, and been a producer of these sort of Z-rate, you know, underground, almost like, like, macro-budgeted films. I wouldn't, they weren't no-budget films. But they had, like, a very small, very tight budget. And Milligan was known to, like many filmmakers of his kind, like Herschel Gordon-Lewis, or, oh, the Incredibly Strange, the guy that directed The Incredibly Strange Creatures. There was an artistry. There was a, there was, like, a knack for sort of, like, an improvised form of storytelling. And almost like a, like, on-the-scene poetic playwriting. Sort of just making it up as he went along. But because he'd lived a storied life, he was his own type of animated creature. And he was, you know, I wouldn't say he was a very good person. That film, I'm sorry, that book really brings to life how, how, how multi-layered his life really was. He'd been abused as a child. He was in the Navy. You know, he was, he was gay in an era when being gay wasn't necessarily any less common. But it was just a difficult time because people were starting to come to terms with it. It was a little more accepted, but it wasn't, it still was something that you didn't talk about. But it wasn't something that was culturally accepted like it is now. And his mother was extremely abusive. And, and he just had a very, you know, very uneven relationship with his family. It came to light years after he was dead that, in a series of interviews that the author continued to do with his family, with Milligan's family, that Milligan was, you know, sexually abusive to other people. Other members of his family, like that he molested, he molested his sister, his younger sister, and that he probably abused another member of his family who was older than him. And he was just kind of a bully. He cheated people out of money. He asked for favors and had never repaid people. He would oftentimes, he just did whatever he could to get, to get paid. And he wasn't paid very well for being a, you know, for making these films. He was paid very, very minimally. And, and just enough to sort of survive in New York and make ends meet. He did have a number of people who survived somewhat under his wing that he had a gay lover who he supported for years and years and years. A guy from the South who was, didn't have any sort of formal education whatsoever. And he was a very simple person and, and, and they had a very loving, very tender relationship that really drove my, my, my, love of the book because what was, what made the ghastly one such an enjoyable read wasn't just learning about these films directed by Andy Milligan, which was in itself very interesting. But it was, it was this story that sort of emerged from underneath that, from underneath the rubble of the tenderness that actually existed in his life. The things that were very sweet and very, and just, just very beautiful almost. He had this relationship with this, with this uncompletely uneducated guy who was sort of the opposite of him because Milligan was, was pretty cultured. And that's where other elements became a little more interesting in that if you look at Milligan's films on the surface, they appear, I mean, if you were to like look at them with the sound off, they would appear to be extremely well shot, but just sort of very bare bones, minimalist, sort of, interestingly lit, obviously very low budget and just sort of one shot, one take or so it would seem. And, and the use of some very interesting, very, very stark angles and some very refracted lighting and not a whole lot else. But when you watch his films and really, really start to uncover the stories, there's, there's a deep vulnerable pain there. And then he actually was like a very interesting storyteller. Considering that he just made these films up as he went along, which makes the films much more interesting than they would appear if they were just these, you know, these studio products. I mean, they would be just sort of like another movie, but because they had this immediacy, there's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of artistic risks that he took that I don't know if he knew that they were risks, certain angles that did that break the, that broke, that break the rules of editing, that break the rules of cinematography and of filmmaking, but they actually achieve like these accidental, as a filmmaker, you know, and as a, as like someone that watches movies, well, you know, I've watched a lot of movies when you notice these rules being broken. Sometimes you don't even, you don't even notice it. Like it just happens. And you're like, man, there's something refreshing about this. There's something really different. There's just something immediate. And it's not like a, it's not like a first year film student kind of different because, because Andy Milligan was making films for years and years and years and years. And he was already an accomplished, you know, he was already, already, he'd been a photographer his whole life. So he knew how to use a camera and he knew how to use a film camera very well. So when he's, when his style, when it's, when these independent films and he, you know, I would define them as shot exploitation start coming up. There's like this, like I said, there's this immediacy to them and there's this, there's this otherness to them. And upon like a, like a, like a repeat viewing, the stories have a, have a layer of like really, really good storytelling. And Milligan was involved in an off, what they were, and I'm not joking here. This is what they refer to it as the off, off, off Broadway scene. So not the off Broadway scene and not off, off Broadway scene, but the like, it's not even considered a legitimate theater troupe where it's sort of community theater being put up for the sake of itself, but with people that are involved occasionally in off Broadway productions or an off, off Broadway production or, or in the avant-garde theater world. Fastbinder was actually briefly involved in this scene as were a number of other, I can't recall the names, but there was one name that came up that was actually a prominent, became a prominent playwright later on in his career. And they all congregated at this place known as the CINO Cafe, which was in Manhattan. And the CINO Cafe was considered a major artistic hotspot for these like sort of extraordinary extremely off the radar, but extremely prolific, sort of wandering poets, vagabond, troubadour poets of sorts with no place to go, but people that actually had some sort of a talent, not people that weren't talented, that weren't, that didn't have the knack to just prolifically create. Cause what Joe CINO wanted for his cafe, which was like a coffee shop, he wanted, he wanted a play a night. So if you couldn't come up with a play, like, like a play every week, and stage it, light it and produce it and have it be like, not only entertaining, but like a successful work of art, he didn't want you in his troupe. So his, his, the CINO Cafe was considered this like training ground for the future. Like as a place when you couldn't get your plays produced or you couldn't get your plays sold, you, well, at least you could put your plays on here if they were good.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0,

Yes. Excellent. Well, what a surprise. It's 1 o'clock Central Time. Welcome to our show, Cinema Fireside, where we speak about all things film. In our studio, we have our great, great colleague, Zav LaPley. On the phone, we are expecting Gabe Van Handel and yours truly. My name is Mark Borchardt. As we begin the show, I just want to thank again Zav LaPley for running this show, running the Riverwest radio outfit, and so on and so forth. It's a nexus of the Milwaukee community. It's a cultural icon, and without it, Milwaukee would have a void in its heart that would not be too cool in any regard. This is a meeting place of good souls, intellectual exchanges, spirited conversations, so on and so forth. And Zav LaPley is the glue that holds it all together. He certainly has many colleagues, true hearts that assist him, and so on and so forth. But he certainly is at the helm of this. And Gabe is back in Milwaukee from Florida, but he's a hardworking man above and beyond the arts, so we're waiting for that ring. Mm-hmm. And... Yeah, it's like we're going back in the old days of when Gabe was in Florida and we were in Milwaukee. Yes, it does have an echo of that memory. And he called in every week. Oh, wow, interesting. Yeah, so today's show, we're going to be talking about Andy Milligan, the work of Andy Milligan. Right, Mark? Yes, and Zav will dutifully explain all things Andy Milligan now. Just an inside joke, I think. Mm-hmm. Well, okay, Andy Milligan is a very low-budget filmmaker, and I came across him in one of my numerous books. This was a cult book listing many films and a company, made by many dramatic still photos, black and whites. And one of them was of the ghastly ones, and it looked pretty intriguing. And I saw that Andy Milligan was the filmmaker, and I also noticed that it was shot on 16mm. So I was absolutely intrigued by that premise. And through the good graces of Riverwest Film and Video, I got to rent that film, and it was... Actually, I will ally Andy Milligan with producer David S. Friedman, who I have a collection of some of his short films. Friedman's not a director but a producer, but he makes films along the likes of Andy Milligan. He's really low-budget films, and I think with David S. Friedman, you know, there's definitely a bit of the artistic imagination in them as opposed to something like the ABC movie of the week. And I always kind of categorize the ABC movie of the week as a template for very basic marginal filmmaking, where the story comes first, and the story is not to be dissuaded by any cinematic pyrotechnics, such as, you know, bizarre low angles, disconcerting fisheye lens, you know, none of that avant-garde stuff that would distract from the fundamental formula of a prosaic film. Whereas filmmakers or producers such as David S. Friedman, and all those filmmakers, they kind of said, hey, you know, we've got nothing to lose. We're not working for a studio. We love film. You know, let's see where our imagination takes us. And that's not allowed in the studio system because that's more of a very mercenary, monetary machine mechanism. And when you have nothing financially to lose, really, you can, you know, let the imagination go free, and that's one of the joys of these this milieu of underground filmmaking is to see these, all of these imaginative tangents, you know, with a selection of lens, different ways of shooting at angles, so on and so forth. And also, you know, you don't have a lot of professional actors and actresses. You have maybe people from the local theater, or you just maybe have family and friends, people off the streets, or people who just dig hanging around and like being in films. So when you watch these movies, you think about who are these people? What are their lives like? You know, what do they do? You know, because these are lives lived on a margin. So when you see these films, you have that periphery of curiosity that just starts to brew, you know, frame by frame as, wait, whose house is that? Whose house are they shooting in? You know, what, where did they get that muscle car? You know, who owns it? You know, did they give them a case of beer to use it that day? And all of that backstory has just got to be utterly fascinating. And as I speak, there we go. There you have it. I love it. You were saying, as you speak? As we speak. The phone rang. So, that being said, I had a minor inconvenience at work, in between shifts, and then had to, I was stuck in the basement. There's no reception whatsoever at a parking garage. Good God. South Korea, where you can get internet service and phone service. It's a mile, like, literally, like, I think, like, two levels below the ground anywhere in the country. So, much different here. Anyway, I'm calling in. Sorry for being a little bit late here. And the cancer rate has doubled. So, yeah, Mark was just introducing the show, Gabe, and talking about some of the charms of an Andy Miller film. Milligan-esque style filmmaking. A filmmaking that, where it's pulled together by elements that, whatever, kind of, whatever you can get together, local actors, local locations, getting someone's restaurant for a scene, getting someone to lend you their muscle car for a shot, and then some of the charm that comes with that. But go ahead, Gabe, and introduce your side to this show today. Well, how I became acquainted with Milligan was, I was, I found a book of his a couple years ago, about, I think it was seven or eight years ago, and something just told me to read it, that it had to be, it had to be read. It just, something about it stuck out. It's called The Ghastly One. And it's written by, I can't remember the name of the author. I gave the book to another friend of mine several years ago. And, oh, pardon me. And passed that along. But it was written by a friend of his who was a journalist, freelance journalist. And it was written over about two, the course of about two decades. And the friend of his sort of became acquainted with him through a friend of a friend of a friend. And thought he was a rather interesting person. And when he found out that he was, like, had been a filmmaker on 42nd Street, and been a producer of these sort of Z-rate, you know, underground, almost like, like, macro-budgeted films. I wouldn't, they weren't no-budget films. But they had, like, a very small, very tight budget. And Milligan was known to, like many filmmakers of his kind, like Herschel Gordon-Lewis, or, oh, the Incredibly Strange, the guy that directed The Incredibly Strange Creatures. There was an artistry. There was a, there was, like, a knack for sort of, like, an improvised form of storytelling. And almost like a, like, on-the-scene poetic playwriting. Sort of just making it up as he went along. But because he'd lived a storied life, he was his own type of animated creature. And he was, you know, I wouldn't say he was a very good person. That film, I'm sorry, that book really brings to life how, how, how multi-layered his life really was. He'd been abused as a child. He was in the Navy. You know, he was, he was gay in an era when being gay wasn't necessarily any less common. But it was just a difficult time because people were starting to come to terms with it. It was a little more accepted, but it wasn't, it still was something that you didn't talk about. But it wasn't something that was culturally accepted like it is now. And his mother was extremely abusive. And, and he just had a very, you know, very uneven relationship with his family. It came to light years after he was dead that, in a series of interviews that the author continued to do with his family, with Milligan's family, that Milligan was, you know, sexually abusive to other people. Other members of his family, like that he molested, he molested his sister, his younger sister, and that he probably abused another member of his family who was older than him. And he was just kind of a bully. He cheated people out of money. He asked for favors and had never repaid people. He would oftentimes, he just did whatever he could to get, to get paid. And he wasn't paid very well for being a, you know, for making these films. He was paid very, very minimally. And, and just enough to sort of survive in New York and make ends meet. He did have a number of people who survived somewhat under his wing that he had a gay lover who he supported for years and years and years. A guy from the South who was, didn't have any sort of formal education whatsoever. And he was a very simple person and, and, and they had a very loving, very tender relationship that really drove my, my, my, love of the book because what was, what made the ghastly one such an enjoyable read wasn't just learning about these films directed by Andy Milligan, which was in itself very interesting. But it was, it was this story that sort of emerged from underneath that, from underneath the rubble of the tenderness that actually existed in his life. The things that were very sweet and very, and just, just very beautiful almost. He had this relationship with this, with this uncompletely uneducated guy who was sort of the opposite of him because Milligan was, was pretty cultured. And that's where other elements became a little more interesting in that if you look at Milligan's films on the surface, they appear, I mean, if you were to like look at them with the sound off, they would appear to be extremely well shot, but just sort of very bare bones, minimalist, sort of, interestingly lit, obviously very low budget and just sort of one shot, one take or so it would seem. And, and the use of some very interesting, very, very stark angles and some very refracted lighting and not a whole lot else. But when you watch his films and really, really start to uncover the stories, there's, there's a deep vulnerable pain there. And then he actually was like a very interesting storyteller. Considering that he just made these films up as he went along, which makes the films much more interesting than they would appear if they were just these, you know, these studio products. I mean, they would be just sort of like another movie, but because they had this immediacy, there's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of artistic risks that he took that I don't know if he knew that they were risks, certain angles that did that break the, that broke, that break the rules of editing, that break the rules of cinematography and of filmmaking, but they actually achieve like these accidental, as a filmmaker, you know, and as a, as like someone that watches movies, well, you know, I've watched a lot of movies when you notice these rules being broken. Sometimes you don't even, you don't even notice it. Like it just happens. And you're like, man, there's something refreshing about this. There's something really different. There's just something immediate. And it's not like a, it's not like a first year film student kind of different because, because Andy Milligan was making films for years and years and years and years. And he was already an accomplished, you know, he was already, already, he'd been a photographer his whole life. So he knew how to use a camera and he knew how to use a film camera very well. So when he's, when his style, when it's, when these independent films and he, you know, I would define them as shot exploitation start coming up. There's like this, like I said, there's this immediacy to them and there's this, there's this otherness to them. And upon like a, like a, like a repeat viewing, the stories have a, have a layer of like really, really good storytelling. And Milligan was involved in an off, what they were, and I'm not joking here. This is what they refer to it as the off, off, off Broadway scene. So not the off Broadway scene and not off, off Broadway scene, but the like, it's not even considered a legitimate theater troupe where it's sort of community theater being put up for the sake of itself, but with people that are involved occasionally in off Broadway productions or an off, off Broadway production or, or in the avant-garde theater world. Fastbinder was actually briefly involved in this scene as were a number of other, I can't recall the names, but there was one name that came up that was actually a prominent, became a prominent playwright later on in his career. And they all congregated at this place known as the CINO Cafe, which was in Manhattan. And the CINO Cafe was considered a major artistic hotspot for these like sort of extraordinary extremely off the radar, but extremely prolific, sort of wandering poets, vagabond, troubadour poets of sorts with no place to go, but people that actually had some sort of a talent, not people that weren't talented, that weren't, that didn't have the knack to just prolifically create. Cause what Joe CINO wanted for his cafe, which was like a coffee shop, he wanted, he wanted a play a night. So if you couldn't come up with a play, like, like a play every week, and stage it, light it and produce it and have it be like, not only entertaining, but like a successful work of art, he didn't want you in his troupe. So his, his, the CINO Cafe was considered this like training ground for the future. Like as a place when you couldn't get your plays produced or you couldn't get your plays sold, you, well, at least you could put your plays on here if they were good.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start":
