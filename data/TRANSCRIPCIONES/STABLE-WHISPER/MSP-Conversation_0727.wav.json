{"text": " Other than that, no, it wasn't a, it wasn't a, I don't think it was ever a big, a big thing. I didn't think so. You didn't actually get to meet my dad. Yeah. Yeah. Which is why we would have those types of conversations. We'd be like, but he's going to have to understand that you've grown up. And he's like, you don't get it. Yeah. Tell the Mexican father that about his only daughter. I mean, yeah. No, I mean, I say that. I used to say that with jokes, right? Like, I used to say that, like, you know, because Jess didn't have a lot of freedom when she went back home. Cause she's got to be stuck in the house, but she's also the only girl in her family. So I say jokingly, like, nah, you got to tell them like you, yo, you 20 years old. And I know some of y'all like, what? Tell your pops what? Nah. But I also grew up very different. Like in that I was given a lot of responsibility when I was younger and freedom. Not necessarily. Yeah. Yeah. Jess had all the responsibility in her family, but like I had a lot of freedom. Especially because my dad was away for a while. And so my mom trusted me with a lot of things. So like I went out to all the parties and stuff and, you know, I drove around all the time. I was able to go out wherever I needed to. I went shopping for the house. I'd help out with bills and things like that. But like, and because, because I was, I was such a good kid. My grades were always great. I got along with everybody. I never got into trouble. You want to talk about how you're not Mr. Popular, but continue. Okay. Whatever. We're going to edit that out. Somebody want to get bold out here in these streets. But having that kind of freedom, I've grown to understand that a lot of people don't have that kind of freedom. Like a lot of people, especially women, especially women in their family. When you go away to college, when you come home, you still, yeah. Yeah. Especially women of color. You're still, you're still the daughter. Like you're still staying in. You still have a curfew to get back in the house and you can't go to all these places. And I think, that's a major thing to me. But I think that's what meant a lot. I think when you're, when you were able to say to your dad, I'm going to the DR with Kyle. I was so scared. Yeah. Like I think, yeah. So we took a vacation together. Kyle wanted to go out of the country to somewhere I've never been before. So, so we, we took a spring break and we were like, we got our money together and we just went to, we booked a Airbnb and, and, and DR and Cabaretta. Cabaretta. Cabaretta. Which is where I went back to after the breakup. Yeah. Yeah. So, so we were in Cabaretta. This was months before the breakup. And, um, we just spent a week out there. And I think that was a big thing for me because, you know, you got to see like how somebody is outside. Like you get to live with somebody for a while, um, and really see how they function. That was bigger to me than, than I guess meeting your family. Cause you got to tell your dad and deal with that. And then we had to, we also had to get the money together. Cause we're also struggling college students. Like we don't got, we don't have bread like that. Right. But the fact that we were still able to do it and, you know, um, and you could, you could have easily like done somewhere else or stayed in the States or, but we chose to go overseas and do that. So the fact that you were able to have that conversation with your pops and be willing to do that, I think that was more important to me than, you know, actually meeting him. Cause it's like a sacrifice. If, if in any relationship you have to be, you have to know what your partner is willing to sacrifice for you. Um, and not on some like, you know, some G-ship, like I'm about to sell my house for you girl. Like, but like just on simple, some simple shit, like you, you trying to enjoy your life. You have to make sure that your partner is trying to enjoy their life too. It's compatibility. All your testing is compatibility this whole time. Um, so I think that was a big thing for me. I think something that just came up a lot too was, I'm Latina, you're black. That's, that's true. That is big. This is the big interracial co-op couple. I'm all about the swirl, you know, jumping the swirl. Yeah. Like guys would always be the ones to ask me this. Like my guy friends would be like, how's your dad going to take this? Like, how's your family going to feel about this? Like what's going to happen when they meet them? Or if you ever bring them home, like, what is this going to look like? And I mean, I, I thought about it, but I've never really been like, yeah, what is this actually going to look like? Until I had to have that conversation with my dad. Um, and I remember I was really, really scared to do it because never before had we had to have a conversation about this. Like I grew up in East Los Angeles, little Mexico. Yeah. Nothing other than Mexicans pocket of maybe like Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans. And that's it. Like, that's what you see in my part of LA. So bringing that up to my dad, um, and then just like having to bring it up, like, oh, I'm talking to someone may or may not go anywhere, but I wanted to see how you feel about the fact that he's not Mexican and that he's not like a Latino, that he's black. And I think it was the answer that I got from my dad that one told me like, okay, I, I can do this. Um, and then just the advice that he gave me when he was like, there's assholes of every race. So as long as you know, the person treats you right. Um, and I know I've raised you so that you know how you should and shouldn't be treated. Like, I feel like you can make this decision for yourself. Um, again, also drawing from his own experience, my stepmom is Filipino. Our family got a lot of heat sometimes, even from family because she wasn't Mexican or isn't in like the cultural aspect of that. Um, so him telling me like, know what you're going to get into, know what you're going to have to deal with, um, and be ready for it. Not like you shouldn't do this. Isn't going to happen. Like I, God forbid, because that is how some people in my family feel like, like don't show up to the house. Don't bring a certain type of person home. A lot of times it's not said, but you know, it's implied. It's something you grow up with. Um, so the fact that like my dad pretty much gave me his blessing and like, didn't see that as an issue anymore, which is kind of like, do you boo? Um, and that's something we got lucky with. Yeah. Cause my family don't care about nothing. My family don't care about nothing. Um, I think the big, the biggest thing when Jamaican cultures, those that would have been a problem is if I, if I brought a man back, like, like, you know, which I don't, I don't flow that way, but you know, and I do, I strongly disagree with my family on that, but you know, there's nobody that's had to jump into that in our family. But in terms of race, nah, my parents never, never cared, never brought it up. Really. I was like, yeah, it's my girlfriend. Oh, okay. Like as a Latina, that is a really big thing. And it goes a cross, like me being Mexican, like it's something that comes up a lot of times and I see it time and time again on the internet or like within my own family or seeing like how certain relationships have played out or like how certain people get treated because of certain things, like to be able to take that takes a lot or like, again, when I would tell you certain things that like comments that were made to myself with that. So like having to take that for yourself and defend the person, like again, the sacrifices that go into, you know, this relationship. Exactly. So make sure you know what you're getting into. Yep. Um, any advice, do you have, do you have any advice for anybody? And I mean, you can make it as specific as possible, as specific as possible because you are a Latina woman. So if there's specifically anything that you're going through as a Latina or, or a, a woman in general for any advice going through a breakup and how you feel about it. You've been able, you were able to deal with it and move forward. Like, what would that be? Like, what would your advice be for anybody listening out there who might be going through something similar? So I mentioned this to you, but both my brothers went through breakups after I did. Um, and again, like they reach out to me and stuff. And specifically my stepbrother who I didn't start really getting close to until around me leaving home and me coming back. Which is crazy because y'all seem like the most similar, but anyway. Yeah, exactly. That might be it. But so the fact that he's like out in Rochester now by himself and going through a breakup and he asked me specifically, like, how did you deal with the breakup after Kyle? And like, how are you doing now? What does this look like for you? And I, I didn't feel like I was the person to ask that question to, not just like because I'm his older sister, but because of how I felt I'd like been in the relationship. So again, like not, feeling as comfortable opening up or like certain topics, not being able to have conversations about or being ready just because I never had to do it before. So being pushed to that, um, was really trying for me. But I think just being comfortable enough with yourself to do that, I think is what needs to happen first. Like you need to be able to have some sort of relationship with yourself and be comfortable with certain aspects before you try and do that with another person. And then it's not personal. Like every time you would ask me certain questions or ask me why something was the way that it was, it was never like you're asking me this or something. I hadn't, I guess, like thought about it before or engage with it. And it wasn't like, oh, I don't, I don't just want to divulge this information to you. It was just, I hadn't done that for myself. Yeah. So I couldn't really do that for you yet. True. Um, which I think is something I was trying to get my brothers to understand. It's like you have to be able to be in a certain place for yourself first in order to be able to do that for another person. Or even now when you'll ask me like, why is it that she has no trouble like talking to guys or something? And I feel like I'm the one that's over here hurting. Like, what do I do situation? And I think it just goes back to like the time piece, like not rushing through the process or trying to rush through the process because people expect you to be doing something according to a certain timeline. Um, and being okay with that, like being able to stand up and be able to stand by yourself. Like Frankie always tells me all the time, he's like, set your boundaries and stick to them. Shout out to Frankie. Yeah. Being our mediator. Frankie's a good friend of us both. And he, he, he has the most interesting role because he is close friends with us both, but had to deal with us breaking up with each other at the same time. Yeah. And having us both contact him like, Frankie, what the fuck do I do? Frankie, I'm losing this. Shout out to Frankie, man. Um, but yeah, that like setting your boundaries and sticking to them, like not rushing through it because you're expected to be doing something. Um, if you're not ready, you're not ready. And like, that's what it is. But I think it takes like a strong personality to be able to do that for yourself. You got to stick to your guns and that's kind of hard for people to do, which again goes back to the growth piece. It's my, my advice to any guy who, who like me is, um, I mean, first, first, first of all, I think if, if, if you're a guy, one, there's a lot of things. I have a lot of opinions on relationships. I think that one, if you are uncertain about your situation, you need to either have that conversation with somebody or, or, or just end it. If you are uncertain about it, you have to have that conversation or, or just end it. Can you, if you are willing to have that conversation with somebody, I think that shows growth. And I think if you, if, if you run away from that conversation, you don't need to be in that. Yeah. You need to not be there. Uh, so that's one. Um, but also tell them, don't just like, yeah, yeah, exactly. Also, yeah, be decent. Like, I didn't know if the reason is worse because I, I'm an honest person. Like, you know, I don't think you can, just wake up one day and be like, it's a wrap. Yeah. Right. Um, exactly. That's, that's how you get cut. Yeah. The window shattered, you know, that just Jasmine Sullivan bust the windows out my car. Like somebody will do that. If you, if you treat them wrong, it's, it's, it's the golden rule. Everything goes back to the golden rule, right? Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you. Right. I think that's, that's the big thing. And if you're, if you do everything out of the pureness of your heart, like you are really doing this, anything, you do regardless of is that if that's relationships, your, your motives in life, your, your ambitions, if anything you do out of the purity of your purity of your heart, you will be rewarded, um, wholeheartedly. Um, but a big thing that I think is important is that you need to, like Jess said, you need to understand yourself before you jump into any relationship. You need to understand what, what you're bringing into the table and what you're, what you're really trying to get out of the relationship as well. I mean, it's, I think it's very easy to just say like, I like you, I like you too. Let's do it. Let's do this. And it's not how it was before me and Jess were even together. We were like, before we were officially together, we were together for eight months prior to the two years. Right. Like, uh, like, so I think that's a strong testament to like set up. And a lot of people say that's not, that's like a lot of time and you know, it's different strokes for different folks, but I'm definitely of the mind that you should get to know somebody before you're jumping into something that's going to be a lot deeper than you might be ready for. Cause you have to be, you have to be able to deal with it. On that note, I want to thank you just again for agreeing to do this. I can't tell you how much I do appreciate this. Like, um, just being able to talk to me about this topic. And some people say it's a long time. It's still like relatively soon. So I appreciate it. Like the vulnerability out to the public, you know, this is our, about our stories and what we go through and what we're afraid to talk about as people of color. So please continue to send me topics that you want us to talk about. Um, comment, let me know what you thought about this one on Facebook, on Twitter, it's facebook.com backslash grubcast, uh, right on the wall. Tell me what you thought.

I didn't think so. You didn't actually get to meet my dad. Yeah. Yeah. Which is why we would have those types of conversations. We'd be like, but he's going to have to understand that you've grown up. And he's like, you don't get it. Yeah. Tell the Mexican father that about his only daughter. I mean, yeah. No, I mean, I say that. I used to say that with jokes, right? Like, I used to say that, like, you know, because Jess didn't have a lot of freedom when she went back home. Cause she's got to be stuck in the house, but she's also the only girl in her family. So I say jokingly, like, nah, you got to tell them like you, yo, you 20 years old. And I know some of y'all like, what? Tell your pops what? Nah. But I also grew up very different. Like in that I was given a lot of responsibility when I was younger and freedom. Not necessarily. Yeah. Yeah. Jess had all the responsibility in her family, but like I had a lot of freedom. Especially because my dad was away for a while. And so my mom trusted me with a lot of things. So like I went out to all the parties and stuff and, you know, I drove around all the time. I was able to go out wherever I needed to. I went shopping for the house. I'd help out with bills and things like that. But like, and because, because I was, I was such a good kid. My grades were always great. I got along with everybody. I never got into trouble. You want to talk about how you're not Mr. Popular, but continue. Okay. Whatever. We're going to edit that out. Somebody want to get bold out here in these streets. But having that kind of freedom, I've grown to understand that a lot of people don't have that kind of freedom. Like a lot of people, especially women, especially women in their family. When you go away to college, when you come home, you still, yeah. Yeah. Especially women of color. You're still, you're still the daughter. Like you're still staying in. You still have a curfew to get back in the house and you can't go to all these places. And I think, that's a major thing to me. But I think that's what meant a lot. I think when you're, when you were able to say to your dad, I'm going to the DR with Kyle. I was so scared. Yeah. Like I think, yeah. So we took a vacation together. Kyle wanted to go out of the country to somewhere I've never been before. So, so we, we took a spring break and we were like, we got our money together and we just went to, we booked a Airbnb and, and, and DR and Cabaretta. Cabaretta. Cabaretta. Which is where I went back to after the breakup. Yeah. Yeah. So, so we were in Cabaretta. This was months before the breakup. And, um, we just spent a week out there. And I think that was a big thing for me because, you know, you got to see like how somebody is outside. Like you get to live with somebody for a while, um, and really see how they function. That was bigger to me than, than I guess meeting your family. Cause you got to tell your dad and deal with that. And then we had to, we also had to get the money together. Cause we're also struggling college students. Like we don't got, we don't have bread like that. Right. But the fact that we were still able to do it and, you know, um, and you could, you could have easily like done somewhere else or stayed in the States or, but we chose to go overseas and do that. So the fact that you were able to have that conversation with your pops and be willing to do that, I think that was more important to me than, you know, actually meeting him. Cause it's like a sacrifice. If, if in any relationship you have to be, you have to know what your partner is willing to sacrifice for you. Um, and not on some like, you know, some G-ship, like I'm about to sell my house for you girl. Like, but like just on simple, some simple shit, like you, you trying to enjoy your life. You have to make sure that your partner is trying to enjoy their life too. It's compatibility. All your testing is compatibility this whole time. Um, so I think that was a big thing for me. I think something that just came up a lot too was, I'm Latina, you're black. That's, that's true. That is big. This is the big interracial co-op couple. I'm all about the swirl, you know, jumping the swirl. Yeah. Like guys would always be the ones to ask me this. Like my guy friends would be like, how's your dad going to take this? Like, how's your family going to feel about this? Like what's going to happen when they meet them? Or if you ever bring them home, like, what is this going to look like? And I mean, I, I thought about it, but I've never really been like, yeah, what is this actually going to look like? Until I had to have that conversation with my dad. Um, and I remember I was really, really scared to do it because never before had we had to have a conversation about this. Like I grew up in East Los Angeles, little Mexico. Yeah. Nothing other than Mexicans pocket of maybe like Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans. And that's it. Like, that's what you see in my part of LA. So bringing that up to my dad, um, and then just like having to bring it up, like, oh, I'm talking to someone may or may not go anywhere, but I wanted to see how you feel about the fact that he's not Mexican and that he's not like a Latino, that he's black. And I think it was the answer that I got from my dad that one told me like, okay, I, I can do this. Um, and then just the advice that he gave me when he was like, there's assholes of every race. So as long as you know, the person treats you right. Um, and I know I've raised you so that you know how you should and shouldn't be treated. Like, I feel like you can make this decision for yourself. Um, again, also drawing from his own experience, my stepmom is Filipino. Our family got a lot of heat sometimes, even from family because she wasn't Mexican or isn't in like the cultural aspect of that. Um, so him telling me like, know what you're going to get into, know what you're going to have to deal with, um, and be ready for it. Not like you shouldn't do this. Isn't going to happen. Like I, God forbid, because that is how some people in my family feel like, like don't show up to the house. Don't bring a certain type of person home. A lot of times it's not said, but you know, it's implied. It's something you grow up with. Um, so the fact that like my dad pretty much gave me his blessing and like, didn't see that as an issue anymore, which is kind of like, do you boo? Um, and that's something we got lucky with. Yeah. Cause my family don't care about nothing. My family don't care about nothing. Um, I think the big, the biggest thing when Jamaican cultures, those that would have been a problem is if I, if I brought a man back, like, like, you know, which I don't, I don't flow that way, but you know, and I do, I strongly disagree with my family on that, but you know, there's nobody that's had to jump into that in our family. But in terms of race, nah, my parents never, never cared, never brought it up. Really. I was like, yeah, it's my girlfriend. Oh, okay. Like as a Latina, that is a really big thing. And it goes a cross, like me being Mexican, like it's something that comes up a lot of times and I see it time and time again on the internet or like within my own family or seeing like how certain relationships have played out or like how certain people get treated because of certain things, like to be able to take that takes a lot or like, again, when I would tell you certain things that like comments that were made to myself with that. So like having to take that for yourself and defend the person, like again, the sacrifices that go into, you know, this relationship. Exactly. So make sure you know what you're getting into. Yep. Um, any advice, do you have, do you have any advice for anybody? And I mean, you can make it as specific as possible, as specific as possible because you are a Latina woman. So if there's specifically anything that you're going through as a Latina or, or a, a woman in general for any advice going through a breakup and how you feel about it. You've been able, you were able to deal with it and move forward. Like, what would that be? Like, what would your advice be for anybody listening out there who might be going through something similar? So I mentioned this to you, but both my brothers went through breakups after I did. Um, and again, like they reach out to me and stuff. And specifically my stepbrother who I didn't start really getting close to until around me leaving home and me coming back. Which is crazy because y'all seem like the most similar, but anyway. Yeah, exactly. That might be it. But so the fact that he's like out in Rochester now by himself and going through a breakup and he asked me specifically, like, how did you deal with the breakup after Kyle? And like, how are you doing now? What does this look like for you? And I, I didn't feel like I was the person to ask that question to, not just like because I'm his older sister, but because of how I felt I'd like been in the relationship. So again, like not, feeling as comfortable opening up or like certain topics, not being able to have conversations about or being ready just because I never had to do it before. So being pushed to that, um, was really trying for me. But I think just being comfortable enough with yourself to do that, I think is what needs to happen first. Like you need to be able to have some sort of relationship with yourself and be comfortable with certain aspects before you try and do that with another person. And then it's not personal. Like every time you would ask me certain questions or ask me why something was the way that it was, it was never like you're asking me this or something. I hadn't, I guess, like thought about it before or engage with it. And it wasn't like, oh, I don't, I don't just want to divulge this information to you. It was just, I hadn't done that for myself. Yeah. So I couldn't really do that for you yet. True. Um, which I think is something I was trying to get my brothers to understand. It's like you have to be able to be in a certain place for yourself first in order to be able to do that for another person. Or even now when you'll ask me like, why is it that she has no trouble like talking to guys or something? And I feel like I'm the one that's over here hurting. Like, what do I do situation? And I think it just goes back to like the time piece, like not rushing through the process or trying to rush through the process because people expect you to be doing something according to a certain timeline. Um, and being okay with that, like being able to stand up and be able to stand by yourself. Like Frankie always tells me all the time, he's like, set your boundaries and stick to them. Shout out to Frankie. Yeah. Being our mediator. Frankie's a good friend of us both. And he, he, he has the most interesting role because he is close friends with us both, but had to deal with us breaking up with each other at the same time. Yeah. And having us both contact him like, Frankie, what the fuck do I do? Frankie, I'm losing this. Shout out to Frankie, man. Um, but yeah, that like setting your boundaries and sticking to them, like not rushing through it because you're expected to be doing something. Um, if you're not ready, you're not ready. And like, that's what it is. But I think it takes like a strong personality to be able to do that for yourself. You got to stick to your guns and that's kind of hard for people to do, which again goes back to the growth piece. It's my, my advice to any guy who, who like me is, um, I mean, first, first, first of all, I think if, if, if you're a guy, one, there's a lot of things. I have a lot of opinions on relationships. I think that one, if you are uncertain about your situation, you need to either have that conversation with somebody or, or, or just end it. If you are uncertain about it, you have to have that conversation or, or just end it. Can you, if you are willing to have that conversation with somebody, I think that shows growth. And I think if you, if, if you run away from that conversation, you don't need to be in that. Yeah. You need to not be there. Uh, so that's one. Um, but also tell them, don't just like, yeah, yeah, exactly. Also, yeah, be decent. Like, I didn't know if the reason is worse because I, I'm an honest person. Like, you know, I don't think you can, just wake up one day and be like, it's a wrap. Yeah. Right. Um, exactly. That's, that's how you get cut. Yeah. The window shattered, you know, that just Jasmine Sullivan bust the windows out my car. Like somebody will do that. If you, if you treat them wrong, it's, it's, it's the golden rule. Everything goes back to the golden rule, right? Do unto others as you would like them to do unto you. Right. I think that's, that's the big thing. And if you're, if you do everything out of the pureness of your heart, like you are really doing this, anything, you do regardless of is that if that's relationships, your, your motives in life, your, your ambitions, if anything you do out of the purity of your purity of your heart, you will be rewarded, um, wholeheartedly. Um, but a big thing that I think is important is that you need to, like Jess said, you need to understand yourself before you jump into any relationship. You need to understand what, what you're bringing into the table and what you're, what you're really trying to get out of the relationship as well. I mean, it's, I think it's very easy to just say like, I like you, I like you too. Let's do it. Let's do this. And it's not how it was before me and Jess were even together. We were like, before we were officially together, we were together for eight months prior to the two years. Right. Like, uh, like, so I think that's a strong testament to like set up. And a lot of people say that's not, that's like a lot of time and you know, it's different strokes for different folks, but I'm definitely of the mind that you should get to know somebody before you're jumping into something that's going to be a lot deeper than you might be ready for. Cause you have to be, you have to be able to deal with it. On that note, I want to thank you just again for agreeing to do this. I can't tell you how much I do appreciate this. Like, um, just being able to talk to me about this topic. And some people say it's a long time. It's still like relatively soon. So I appreciate it. Like the vulnerability out to the public, you know, this is our, about our stories and what we go through and what we're afraid to talk about as people of color. So please continue to send me topics that you want us to talk about. Um, comment, let me know what you thought about this one on Facebook, on Twitter, it's facebook.com backslash grubcast, uh, right on the wall. Tell me what you thought.
