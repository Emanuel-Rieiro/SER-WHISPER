{"text": " I disagree. I don't see how it's a matriarchy, because I don't think that any of the female characters are trying to oppress any of the male characters. But you realize at the end they literally crown her as queen, with her and Maleficent being the rulers of these lands. Which is fine, but I feel like it's similar to the way it treats morality. It doesn't just give the humane, equal treatment to everybody. It just flips it to this other person you're not used to. Which I don't really think is any better than what it's criticizing, you know what I mean? I think the goal should be this humane treatment of everybody, not just flipping the roles we're used to. I think because it's so rare to see the female gender being treated this way, in this strong way, where you see leadership and all this stuff, I feel like I 100% support movies like this that do kind of flop gender roles. I definitely don't have that problem with this movie, feeling like it just turns into a matriarchy. I mean, it kind of literally does, at the end. No, I think what it is, is like, it's like a movie about these two, like, female, like, very strong female characters that just end up helping each other in one way or another. I don't think it says anything about, like, the male roles at all. I mean, you know, and that's a fair point. And, you know, maybe I'm just like, I'm just looking at it a little too in-depth. But again, I just feel like it also, it's too uncomfortable with the way that it also reflects my problem with its hypocrisy about the morality, where I feel like, again, I think both do the same thing. Like, the morality just switches one person for the other person, and the gender politics just switches one role for the other role. Like, that's not really what we should be striving to do, you know? Like, that's not the point of all of this, you know? It's not just... But I think it's important to do that now. Sure. I think it's important, I think it's necessary to do that gender swap now. And I agree. Especially in, like, a big Disney, like, Hollywood movie. Sure, sure. I think it's absolutely, like, necessary right now. And I agree with that. My problem is just in the context of a movie that sets itself up to be this, like, humane thing, like Maleficent does. Don't feel like that's a humane way of treating everything. And I think our big difference here is that I don't, I'm not so caught up on that idea that Maleficent is doing this, like, is being general in its message. I think the message is more specific to Maleficent. No. As a character. No. And not as... For the record, I totally agree with you, Janie. I think you're, Jordan, I think you're losing sight a little bit of character perspective in this movie. I think you're discounting the fact that movies have thematic stuff beyond just narrative stuff. But I think Janie and I both agree. We're not saying it doesn't, but we're just saying, I think, the thing is, maybe we're waiting a little too heavily on the character, and maybe you're waiting a little too heavily on the thematic. I mean, that's what the whole movie is. That's what the whole movie positions itself as. Like, from the opening narration, that's what the movie is saying. It's not the story you thought. It's something else. Correct. Yeah. About the character. No. Absolutely. About the whole story. They're not talking about the characters and what you thought. They don't say the characters and what you thought. They say the story isn't what you thought. The end narration doesn't. Yes, it does. The end narration talks about Maleficent, the person who saved our kingdom. It was not a hero or a villain. It was both hero and villain. Yes. That's the whole... Absolutely. Maleficent was. They're not talking about the story at that point. It's not just Maleficent. It's the whole character and the idea of the character. Not just her as a person. It's the whole story is not what you thought. I mean, you guys are... I agree that on just the character stuff, okay, but the movie isn't just about that one... It's not that small-minded. And, you know, filmmaker... I'm... You know, when filmmakers set out to make movies like this, they're not only thinking in those terms. Are you sure? You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, yeah. You don't think that the filmmakers aren't examining every facet of this? I know. I'm just saying that I don't think you guys are giving enough credit to what this movie is trying to do. It's clearly doing more. I just think it doesn't quite follow through on everything it tries to accomplish. And we agree. Yes. Okay. We've said that we agree. It'd do more. It would be good. Fine. Whatever. But it's not just about doing more. It's about that it's not succeeding at what it's trying to do. I think you're saying you need the follow-through. Exactly. And I think what we're saying is that we're so appreciative that it even is taking the steps to throw that pass. You know what I mean? I agree with you. I think it's just... Yeah. I appreciate that it's... Like my football analogy? Yeah. I appreciate that... You're, like, full of them. I appreciate that it's throwing the pass, but it just... My problem is I can't overlook that the pass doesn't connect in the end. Like, I... It's a great... It needs a solid Hail Mary for that final... Exactly. Like, I... The attempt is great. I applaud it. I like that they're doing this thing. It's just... It's not entirely successful. So I can't just give it a pass just because it tries. It's got to actually succeed in the end. And this, I don't think, quite does. I think, like, we're all agreeing, but the thing is, like, I don't think... And describe me if I'm wrong. I don't think Janie and I are saying it's, like, a great, flawless movie. Right. But that we like it because it's doing things that most movies don't. And it's got important qualities. Yes. Yes. But that alone, for me, is not enough. It's not enough to make me like a movie. It's got to go further than just trying. It has to actually succeed. And that's not... And that's... Honestly, that's not... That's not me. I... There are movies that I have seen that I know that, like, in terms of a movie, they're not all that they should be. But if there's, like, this kind of, like, there's this social aspect that I appreciate, that it's going to make me like it. It's going to make me think that it's important. An agenda... An agenda that you agree with does not make the movie good. We gotta... I'm clear on this. A movie... A movie's quality is not dictated by whether or not you agree with what it's doing thematically. I agree. Not entirely. I agree. But I think that's an aspect that comes into play for me. It's... Yes. It comes into play. That's not the end-all, be-all. And that's... I never said it was. No. I'm just saying that that's one aspect of this movie that I do appreciate and I think is important. Okay. But the movie... But you're also agreeing that that... But I'm also saying that as for a movie, it's got amazing character development that I never would have expected to see in a Disney movie. I agree. I agree. And I agree with you that the thematic stuff is great that they're trying it, but I'm also saying trying isn't enough on a thematic level. That's not enough. You have to actually succeed in what you're trying to do, which this movie doesn't. But I'm not talking about thematics anymore. I'm talking about the movie as a whole. No, I know, but you also said that thematically you appreciate that this movie is doing what it's doing. Yeah. And socially... And all I'm saying is it's not enough. The social stuff is great if you follow through, which I don't think this movie does. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. And the same thing with, like, the... Like, the romance angle. I appreciate, like, the feminist qualities and I appreciate what it's trying to do, but at the same time, I also think the movie's treatment of romance is also very cynical and very symptomatic of how Hollywood and society, American society, treats that right now, which is, you know, she does the whole thing of, you know, true love doesn't exist. It's whatever, blah, blah, blah. And you basically... I mean... And at the end, what saves her what the true love is is, like, this maternal bond between Maleficent and Aurora, right? Which is fine, but at the same time, it's... It is also basically... All of, like, the romantic relationships in this movie, which is Maleficent and Stefan and Aurora and Phillip are pretty just, like, nothing. And I get that romance isn't the point, but I'm also saying I don't... I also... I think a big problem with the way... with the current climate of movies and the way, again, culture looks at this stuff is already deeply cynical. And I think this movie's basically just furthering that. But I don't... It's not... No, I don't... I don't think it's saying anything about love. I think it's... I think... I think the fact that Maleficent is the one who, like, brings her out of it signifies that that was true love. Yes, but... Like, the love that she feels for her is absolutely true love. It's not just maternal bond. Absolutely. But what I'm saying... Maleficent also has lines of true love doesn't exist. And she's referring to romantic love when she's talking about that. But... Yeah. But she's saying that... And the movie never... The movie never... never gives a counter to that. But it's saying that... It just allows that to be what happens in the end. Well, I think, like... I think if they had done the movie, if, like, Elle Fanning was getting crowned and Branthwaite shows up, she's like, get the hell out of here. Like, I would agree with you, but, you know, she, like... I know that they're probably gonna start a relationship. Exactly. They didn't fall in love when they first met. Because there's not love at first sight. Right, of course. Which I like that they did that, too, where... Of course, yeah. So, like, I don't... I think you're just full of shit. God. I don't know. I guess I just... I feel like there are too many little problematic things that hinder this movie from being a real success in the end. I think it's a good try, but it's not a... It's not a success. And I think, again, we kind of all agree. I think that's what's stopping it from being great. But I think because it even has... Even that it even brings this stuff up and that it's... Partly there and that it's trying and that it's doing this stuff, like, you know, I think that at least sets it a bar ahead of, like, a lot of the garbage kids' movies that come out. Yeah, but that's like saying it's the tallest midget. You know what I mean? Like, you're basically just... All you're really saying is that... That's a really offensive term. Yeah, that's pretty mean. It's a... You should probably edit that out. Do you want us to pause it? Look, it's a colloquialism, all right? But no, like, okay, all I'm saying is that's really just more of a commentary on the current climate of movies than this movie. You know what I mean? Like, if this movie had come out, like, you know, you're basically... All you're really saying is that most movies suck and that this is doing a little bit more than most movies. Like, that's not really... All I'm saying is that it's elevating some... Again, and I said this... And again, this is, like, where I lost you on it before, but I'll say it again. Like, this is when it's bringing in something better. It's bringing in a movie quality to something that's standard. It's bringing in something more to elevate it. And even if it doesn't all work... But the only reason you're... I feel like the only reason you're saying that's refreshing is because most movies don't do that. You know what I mean? But that's... I mean, that's not really a commentary on the quality of this movie, just that other movies are bad. But how else do we... How do we relate to art by other art? Right, but I'm just saying, but in the terms of... On this movie's own terms, it doesn't really succeed at what it's trying to do. It's just... You're saying that the fact that it's trying is enough to make you appreciate it. But I think it does succeed on... I don't think it... It doesn't, like, drop all of its... You know... I think it drops most of its balls at the end. I was going to say eggs. I didn't know if that was the right term. I think it's better than balls. I was about to say eggs. Yeah, yeah. I think it's got a couple eggs left in its basket. It's a good try. It's a good try. It's just, you know... They'll get them next time. It's, you know... They may not have won the game, but we'll still take them out for pizza after. You know? Alright, well... Anybody have anything else they want to say, or are we done? No? Ryan?

{"text": " I disagree. I don't see how it's a matriarchy, because I don't think that any of the female characters are trying to oppress any of the male characters. But you realize at the end they literally crown her as queen, with her and Maleficent being the rulers of these lands. Which is fine, but I feel like it's similar to the way it treats morality. It doesn't just give the humane, equal treatment to everybody. It just flips it to this other person you're not used to. Which I don't really think is any better than what it's criticizing, you know what I mean? I think the goal should be this humane treatment of everybody, not just flipping the roles we're used to. I think because it's so rare to see the female gender being treated this way, in this strong way, where you see leadership and all this stuff, I feel like I 100% support movies like this that do kind of flop gender roles. I definitely don't have that problem with this movie, feeling like it just turns into a matriarchy. I mean, it kind of literally does, at the end. No, I think what it is, is like, it's like a movie about these two, like, female, like, very strong female characters that just end up helping each other in one way or another. I don't think it says anything about, like, the male roles at all. I mean, you know, and that's a fair point. And, you know, maybe I'm just like, I'm just looking at it a little too in-depth. But again, I just feel like it also, it's too uncomfortable with the way that it also reflects my problem with its hypocrisy about the morality, where I feel like, again, I think both do the same thing. Like, the morality just switches one person for the other person, and the gender politics just switches one role for the other role. Like, that's not really what we should be striving to do, you know? Like, that's not the point of all of this, you know? It's not just... But I think it's important to do that now. Sure. I think it's important, I think it's necessary to do that gender swap now. And I agree. Especially in, like, a big Disney, like, Hollywood movie. Sure, sure. I think it's absolutely, like, necessary right now. And I agree with that. My problem is just in the context of a movie that sets itself up to be this, like, humane thing, like Maleficent does. Don't feel like that's a humane way of treating everything. And I think our big difference here is that I don't, I'm not so caught up on that idea that Maleficent is doing this, like, is being general in its message. I think the message is more specific to Maleficent. No. As a character. No. And not as... For the record, I totally agree with you, Janie. I think you're, Jordan, I think you're losing sight a little bit of character perspective in this movie. I think you're discounting the fact that movies have thematic stuff beyond just narrative stuff. But I think Janie and I both agree. We're not saying it doesn't, but we're just saying, I think, the thing is, maybe we're waiting a little too heavily on the character, and maybe you're waiting a little too heavily on the thematic. I mean, that's what the whole movie is. That's what the whole movie positions itself as. Like, from the opening narration, that's what the movie is saying. It's not the story you thought. It's something else. Correct. Yeah. About the character. No. Absolutely. About the whole story. They're not talking about the characters and what you thought. They don't say the characters and what you thought. They say the story isn't what you thought. The end narration doesn't. Yes, it does. The end narration talks about Maleficent, the person who saved our kingdom. It was not a hero or a villain. It was both hero and villain. Yes. That's the whole... Absolutely. Maleficent was. They're not talking about the story at that point. It's not just Maleficent. It's the whole character and the idea of the character. Not just her as a person. It's the whole story is not what you thought. I mean, you guys are... I agree that on just the character stuff, okay, but the movie isn't just about that one... It's not that small-minded. And, you know, filmmaker... I'm... You know, when filmmakers set out to make movies like this, they're not only thinking in those terms. Are you sure? You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, yeah. You don't think that the filmmakers aren't examining every facet of this? I know. I'm just saying that I don't think you guys are giving enough credit to what this movie is trying to do. It's clearly doing more. I just think it doesn't quite follow through on everything it tries to accomplish. And we agree. Yes. Okay. We've said that we agree. It'd do more. It would be good. Fine. Whatever. But it's not just about doing more. It's about that it's not succeeding at what it's trying to do. I think you're saying you need the follow-through. Exactly. And I think what we're saying is that we're so appreciative that it even is taking the steps to throw that pass. You know what I mean? I agree with you. I think it's just... Yeah. I appreciate that it's... Like my football analogy? Yeah. I appreciate that... You're, like, full of them. I appreciate that it's throwing the pass, but it just... My problem is I can't overlook that the pass doesn't connect in the end. Like, I... It's a great... It needs a solid Hail Mary for that final... Exactly. Like, I... The attempt is great. I applaud it. I like that they're doing this thing. It's just... It's not entirely successful. So I can't just give it a pass just because it tries. It's got to actually succeed in the end. And this, I don't think, quite does. I think, like, we're all agreeing, but the thing is, like, I don't think... And describe me if I'm wrong. I don't think Janie and I are saying it's, like, a great, flawless movie. Right. But that we like it because it's doing things that most movies don't. And it's got important qualities. Yes. Yes. But that alone, for me, is not enough. It's not enough to make me like a movie. It's got to go further than just trying. It has to actually succeed. And that's not... And that's... Honestly, that's not... That's not me. I... There are movies that I have seen that I know that, like, in terms of a movie, they're not all that they should be. But if there's, like, this kind of, like, there's this social aspect that I appreciate, that it's going to make me like it. It's going to make me think that it's important. An agenda... An agenda that you agree with does not make the movie good. We gotta... I'm clear on this. A movie... A movie's quality is not dictated by whether or not you agree with what it's doing thematically. I agree. Not entirely. I agree. But I think that's an aspect that comes into play for me. It's... Yes. It comes into play. That's not the end-all, be-all. And that's... I never said it was. No. I'm just saying that that's one aspect of this movie that I do appreciate and I think is important. Okay. But the movie... But you're also agreeing that that... But I'm also saying that as for a movie, it's got amazing character development that I never would have expected to see in a Disney movie. I agree. I agree. And I agree with you that the thematic stuff is great that they're trying it, but I'm also saying trying isn't enough on a thematic level. That's not enough. You have to actually succeed in what you're trying to do, which this movie doesn't. But I'm not talking about thematics anymore. I'm talking about the movie as a whole. No, I know, but you also said that thematically you appreciate that this movie is doing what it's doing. Yeah. And socially... And all I'm saying is it's not enough. The social stuff is great if you follow through, which I don't think this movie does. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. And the same thing with, like, the... Like, the romance angle. I appreciate, like, the feminist qualities and I appreciate what it's trying to do, but at the same time, I also think the movie's treatment of romance is also very cynical and very symptomatic of how Hollywood and society, American society, treats that right now, which is, you know, she does the whole thing of, you know, true love doesn't exist. It's whatever, blah, blah, blah. And you basically... I mean... And at the end, what saves her what the true love is is, like, this maternal bond between Maleficent and Aurora, right? Which is fine, but at the same time, it's... It is also basically... All of, like, the romantic relationships in this movie, which is Maleficent and Stefan and Aurora and Phillip are pretty just, like, nothing. And I get that romance isn't the point, but I'm also saying I don't... I also... I think a big problem with the way... with the current climate of movies and the way, again, culture looks at this stuff is already deeply cynical. And I think this movie's basically just furthering that. But I don't... It's not... No, I don't... I don't think it's saying anything about love. I think it's... I think... I think the fact that Maleficent is the one who, like, brings her out of it signifies that that was true love. Yes, but... Like, the love that she feels for her is absolutely true love. It's not just maternal bond. Absolutely. But what I'm saying... Maleficent also has lines of true love doesn't exist. And she's referring to romantic love when she's talking about that. But... Yeah. But she's saying that... And the movie never... The movie never... never gives a counter to that. But it's saying that... It just allows that to be what happens in the end. Well, I think, like... I think if they had done the movie, if, like, Elle Fanning was getting crowned and Branthwaite shows up, she's like, get the hell out of here. Like, I would agree with you, but, you know, she, like... I know that they're probably gonna start a relationship. Exactly. They didn't fall in love when they first met. Because there's not love at first sight. Right, of course. Which I like that they did that, too, where... Of course, yeah. So, like, I don't... I think you're just full of shit. God. I don't know. I guess I just... I feel like there are too many little problematic things that hinder this movie from being a real success in the end. I think it's a good try, but it's not a... It's not a success. And I think, again, we kind of all agree. I think that's what's stopping it from being great. But I think because it even has... Even that it even brings this stuff up and that it's... Partly there and that it's trying and that it's doing this stuff, like, you know, I think that at least sets it a bar ahead of, like, a lot of the garbage kids' movies that come out. Yeah, but that's like saying it's the tallest midget. You know what I mean? Like, you're basically just... All you're really saying is that... That's a really offensive term. Yeah, that's pretty mean. It's a... You should probably edit that out. Do you want us to pause it? Look, it's a colloquialism, all right? But no, like, okay, all I'm saying is that's really just more of a commentary on the current climate of movies than this movie. You know what I mean? Like, if this movie had come out, like, you know, you're basically... All you're really saying is that most movies suck and that this is doing a little bit more than most movies. Like, that's not really... All I'm saying is that it's elevating some... Again, and I said this... And again, this is, like, where I lost you on it before, but I'll say it again. Like, this is when it's bringing in something better. It's bringing in a movie quality to something that's standard. It's bringing in something more to elevate it. And even if it doesn't all work... But the only reason you're... I feel like the only reason you're saying that's refreshing is because most movies don't do that. You know what I mean? But that's... I mean, that's not really a commentary on the quality of this movie, just that other movies are bad. But how else do we... How do we relate to art by other art? Right, but I'm just saying, but in the terms of... On this movie's own terms, it doesn't really succeed at what it's trying to do. It's just... You're saying that the fact that it's trying is enough to make you appreciate it. But I think it does succeed on... I don't think it... It doesn't, like, drop all of its... You know... I think it drops most of its balls at the end. I was going to say eggs. I didn't know if that was the right term. I think it's better than balls. I was about to say eggs. Yeah, yeah. I think it's got a couple eggs left in its basket. It's a good try. It's a good try. It's just, you know... They'll get them next time. It's, you know... They may not have won the game, but we'll still take them out for pizza after. You know? Alright, well... Anybody have anything else they want to say, or are we done? No? Ryan?
