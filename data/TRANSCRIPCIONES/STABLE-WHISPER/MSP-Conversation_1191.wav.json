{"text": " We've got Angela on the show today to talk about the films of Manmohan Desai and female characters and feminism in his films. Angela, tell us a little bit about how you started watching Indian cinema. I guess it started in grad school. I was I was a member of the Buddhist society there and I became friends with the Jain society because I was told that we were a spiritual kin. And so then they like we invited each other to, you know, our respective like group meetings and stuff like that. And so the thing that I went to at the Jain society was that they showed the movie Gandhi, Gandhi. And and I loved it. And I mean, I'd seen it before, but I watched it like again and I was stunned by how much I loved it. It was just like sheer, unadulterated passion. And I made a vow to myself that I would watch every single movie about India ever made. And then I just started. And yeah, I mean, I like I started watching Nasruddin Shah movies in the beginning and like parallel cinema. And then I got into Shahrukh Khan. I think like that's a rite of passage that you have to eventually get into. I got into him and I watched all of like the Karen Johar, Shahrukh Khan movies. And then, yeah. And then just sort of spiraled through there. Can I just say that is my favorite getting to watch Bollywood movie story ever. I agree. I agree. And can we can we also note what university she's she's attending? She says it's Oxford. Of all the things Oxford has produced, Angela's loved Gandhi before it's high on the list. I mean, I'm sure I'm not the first. That just makes it even more awesome. So, Angela, which was your first Desai movie? I think it was Parvarsh. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think we could probably look at my website and check. But I think it was that one. What's your favorite one? That's a hard one as well. But I think that Suhag is very, very high up there just in terms of any Hindi film. And Agalilagja also has a very special place in my heart. You know, one of the things I think we all like about Desai films is that there's so much in them and you could pick apart, I think, any single film, at least from the 70s and 80s of his with, you know, any number of different threads or themes or whatever. But one of the ones we are we are all in common interested in is women. So that's the one that we you know, that's the one that we're doing for this show. Right. So who's your favorite female character in Suhag? I mean, it's definitely it's definitely Praveen Babi. I think that actually what I like a lot about her is that she has a lot of agency, which is something that a lot of female characters don't often have. So she has the so she gets to have fun. Like we meet her and she's having a social life and she's getting wasted. Like she also has a lot of agency in like coveting and courting Shashi. Like she's just like, you know, yeah, like she has the drunken song and she's like, by like, oh, my God, you're really high. You're Shashi. Like, let's totally like get together. Like, take me home, man. And he has to fight her off. And then she just ingratiates herself to the mom as well. And I just love it. And like, you know, she gets the help. She enlists the help. The help of one of Shashi's friends. It's just like the courtship is really reversed. And so she I love that aspect of it. I love that she has the power to get Shashi like she sees him. It all comes from her side. I guess I have to agree. I mean, my favorite sequences in that movie are definitely when Praveen comes. I think she just kind of explodes onto the screen and just completely takes it over with her screen presence. And she's just so joyful. And refreshing. I mean, she's like a complete new breath of fresh air. Like I was telling Beth in a previous conversation, one of my favorite, favorite Praveen Barbie sequences of all time is the song that she has with Shashi when she's just drunk and she just lets go and she has fun. And it's right there on screen. And Shashi is just beautiful and adorable and doing borderline kinky stuff like tying her to his jeep with a scarf. And the next day when she shows up at his house and his mother calls her sandal Wally, lipstick Wally, it is absolutely charming. She is charming. And she fails at the domestic task, doesn't she? In that little sequence, like she messes up the cooking and the shoes and whatever. But she still gets her man. And she's going to medical college, which is awesome. And, you know, she's definitely and, you know, the subtext, of course, is that they're so poor. She and her sister that her sister has had to basically prostitute herself. Although this is, you know, a 70s Hindi masala movie. Therefore, she's a virgin prostitute, which is my favorite term ever. Basically, these are two girls who are like really poor and who do something about it. And Rekha is, you know, Rekha is basically Rekha. But she plays a character who is a really good big sister. You know, she wants to do as much as she can, whatever the cost may be. There's a sense all throughout the movie that she has really taken it upon herself to shield her sister from the harsher realities of the situation in that infuriating way that elder siblings sometimes do in Hindi movies. But without being maudlin about it, which, I mean, apart from the usual melodramatic reveal, which, you know, is par for the course. But this is not Duvar, where you've also got an older sibling sacrificing for the younger sibling. It's nothing like that. I also love the way that the pairing of Parveen and Shashi plays out within that context. Because my impression of him in this whole movie is that he stands around and rolls his eyes a lot because everybody else is so wackadoo. And he's like, oh, God, I just need to get my work done until he gets blinded by a chandelier. And then it's all, you know, then it's all great. But that he, you know, that match of them in the Jeep is so funny with her literally hanging out of the Jeep and falling all over. And he's just trying to drive, keep the car on the road. And in non-typical Kapoor driving fashion, actually keeping the car on the road and just muttering and rolling his eyes. It's so funny. And she's just so perfect with her scarf dress, her pink scarf dress, her platform sandals, her pink lipstick, her shiny, gorgeous waterfall of hair. I mean, I totally, like, you know, little girls everywhere want to be, want to grow up to look like Barbie or whatever. I wanted to grow up and look like Parveen Barbie. And I mean, both of those are impossible ideals. But I think, Parveen is a much more healthy option than, you know. But even Nirupa Roy in Suhag, you know, she is a strong woman. She's not your typical weepy mom who's just sitting there, even though she, you know, she wants her husband back and stuff like that. But she's not above disciplining her kids when they do stupid things or telling her husband where to get off when she discovers that he's a criminal. What's another of his films we want to talk about? How about Aghali Lagja, the second? Aghali Lagja. All right, Angela, what are your thoughts on that one? I mean, I feel like we could use that. We could use this one as an example of, like, a film which is incredibly loved by me, incredibly lovable and great and adorable, but fundamentally perhaps a little evil because of the, like, Beth, you can talk about the rape and, like, the impregnating and the whole, like, cautionary tale. Of spending nights, spending a night over with a boy and what will happen to you if you do that. But yeah. So, yeah, we can't, we can't talk about Aghali Lagja without talking about concern rape, as Amrita calls it. And the, and the notion that is in this film and also the later Ganga Jamuna Saraswati, where Amitabh Bachchan does it. And of course, in Aghali Lagja, it's our beloved Shashi Kapoor, who both save women from hypothermia by raping them. The whole notion that in Aghali Lagja, it's also laid out because, again, the woman is a medical student, Sharmila Tagore is a medical student, and they have just been told in their class in the mountains in the, you know, that they, that you have to watch out for this kind of thing and that body heat is the way to save somebody from hypothermia. And Shashi has been a volunteer for their class. And so they lay him on a chunk of ice with a towel over him. And it's all very funny. But then, of course, oh, it happens in real life later. And apparently, to spread body heat to somebody who's got hypothermia actually involves necessarily penetration, even if they seem to be unconscious, which I think is what happens in this movie. So it's just, I don't know, someone needs to talk because I'm, my brain is falling out of my head as I try to make sense of it. And many people have warned me, like, just don't think about that part. Just keep going. Don't pretend it didn't happen. Can't pretend that that didn't happen. And of course, in both instances, pregnancies result and then you get noble single fathers, which I think is probably the whole point of that scene. Akali Lakja is probably the first instance of concern rape that we can find among ourselves.", "segments": [{"start": 0.08, "end": 7.12, "text": " We've got Angela on the show today to talk about the

Angela, tell us a little bit about how you started watching Indian cinema. I guess it started in grad school. I was I was a member of the Buddhist society there and I became friends with the Jain society because I was told that we were a spiritual kin. And so then they like we invited each other to, you know, our respective like group meetings and stuff like that. And so the thing that I went to at the Jain society was that they showed the movie Gandhi, Gandhi. And and I loved it. And I mean, I'd seen it before, but I watched it like again and I was stunned by how much I loved it. It was just like sheer, unadulterated passion. And I made a vow to myself that I would watch every single movie about India ever made. And then I just started. And yeah, I mean, I like I started watching Nasruddin Shah movies in the beginning and like parallel cinema. And then I got into Shahrukh Khan. I think like that's a rite of passage that you have to eventually get into. I got into him and I watched all of like the Karen Johar, Shahrukh Khan movies. And then, yeah. And then just sort of spiraled through there. Can I just say that is my favorite getting to watch Bollywood movie story ever. I agree. I agree. And can we can we also note what university she's she's attending? She says it's Oxford. Of all the things Oxford has produced, Angela's loved Gandhi before it's high on the list. I mean, I'm sure I'm not the first. That just makes it even more awesome. So, Angela, which was your first Desai movie? I think it was Parvarsh. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think we could probably look at my website and check. But I think it was that one. What's your favorite one? That's a hard one as well. But I think that Suhag is very, very high up there just in terms of any Hindi film. And Agalilagja also has a very special place in my heart. You know, one of the things I think we all like about Desai films is that there's so much in them and you could pick apart, I think, any single film, at least from the 70s and 80s of his with, you know, any number of different threads or themes or whatever. But one of the ones we are we are all in common interested in is women. So that's the one that we you know, that's the one that we're doing for this show. Right. So who's your favorite female character in Suhag? I mean, it's definitely it's definitely Praveen Babi. I think that actually what I like a lot about her is that she has a lot of agency, which is something that a lot of female characters don't often have. So she has the so she gets to have fun. Like we meet her and she's having a social life and she's getting wasted. Like she also has a lot of agency in like coveting and courting Shashi. Like she's just like, you know, yeah, like she has the drunken song and she's like, by like, oh, my God, you're really high. You're Shashi. Like, let's totally like get together. Like, take me home, man. And he has to fight her off. And then she just ingratiates herself to the mom as well. And I just love it. And like, you know, she gets the help. She enlists the help. The help of one of Shashi's friends. It's just like the courtship is really reversed. And so she I love that aspect of it. I love that she has the power to get Shashi like she sees him. It all comes from her side. I guess I have to agree. I mean, my favorite sequences in that movie are definitely when Praveen comes. I think she just kind of explodes onto the screen and just completely takes it over with her screen presence. And she's just so joyful. And refreshing. I mean, she's like a complete new breath of fresh air. Like I was telling Beth in a previous conversation, one of my favorite, favorite Praveen Barbie sequences of all time is the song that she has with Shashi when she's just drunk and she just lets go and she has fun. And it's right there on screen. And Shashi is just beautiful and adorable and doing borderline kinky stuff like tying her to his jeep with a scarf. And the next day when she shows up at his house and his mother calls her sandal Wally, lipstick Wally, it is absolutely charming. She is charming. And she fails at the domestic task, doesn't she? In that little sequence, like she messes up the cooking and the shoes and whatever. But she still gets her man. And she's going to medical college, which is awesome. And, you know, she's definitely and, you know, the subtext, of course, is that they're so poor. She and her sister that her sister has had to basically prostitute herself. Although this is, you know, a 70s Hindi masala movie. Therefore, she's a virgin prostitute, which is my favorite term ever. Basically, these are two girls who are like really poor and who do something about it. And Rekha is, you know, Rekha is basically Rekha. But she plays a character who is a really good big sister. You know, she wants to do as much as she can, whatever the cost may be. There's a sense all throughout the movie that she has really taken it upon herself to shield her sister from the harsher realities of the situation in that infuriating way that elder siblings sometimes do in Hindi movies. But without being maudlin about it, which, I mean, apart from the usual melodramatic reveal, which, you know, is par for the course. But this is not Duvar, where you've also got an older sibling sacrificing for the younger sibling. It's nothing like that. I also love the way that the pairing of Parveen and Shashi plays out within that context. Because my impression of him in this whole movie is that he stands around and rolls his eyes a lot because everybody else is so wackadoo. And he's like, oh, God, I just need to get my work done until he gets blinded by a chandelier. And then it's all, you know, then it's all great. But that he, you know, that match of them in the Jeep is so funny with her literally hanging out of the Jeep and falling all over. And he's just trying to drive, keep the car on the road. And in non-typical Kapoor driving fashion, actually keeping the car on the road and just muttering and rolling his eyes. It's so funny. And she's just so perfect with her scarf dress, her pink scarf dress, her platform sandals, her pink lipstick, her shiny, gorgeous waterfall of hair. I mean, I totally, like, you know, little girls everywhere want to be, want to grow up to look like Barbie or whatever. I wanted to grow up and look like Parveen Barbie. And I mean, both of those are impossible ideals. But I think, Parveen is a much more healthy option than, you know. But even Nirupa Roy in Suhag, you know, she is a strong woman. She's not your typical weepy mom who's just sitting there, even though she, you know, she wants her husband back and stuff like that. But she's not above disciplining her kids when they do stupid things or telling her husband where to get off when she discovers that he's a criminal. What's another of his films we want to talk about? How about Aghali Lagja, the second? Aghali Lagja. All right, Angela, what are your thoughts on that one? I mean, I feel like we could use that. We could use this one as an example of, like, a film which is incredibly loved by me, incredibly lovable and great and adorable, but fundamentally perhaps a little evil because of the, like, Beth, you can talk about the rape and, like, the impregnating and the whole, like, cautionary tale. Of spending nights, spending a night over with a boy and what will happen to you if you do that. But yeah. So, yeah, we can't, we can't talk about Aghali Lagja without talking about concern rape, as Amrita calls it. And the, and the notion that is in this film and also the later Ganga Jamuna Saraswati, where Amitabh Bachchan does it. And of course, in Aghali Lagja, it's our beloved Shashi Kapoor, who both save women from hypothermia by raping them. The whole notion that in Aghali Lagja, it's also laid out because, again, the woman is a medical student, Sharmila Tagore is a medical student, and they have just been told in their class in the mountains in the, you know, that they, that you have to watch out for this kind of thing and that body heat is the way to save somebody from hypothermia. And Shashi has been a volunteer for their class. And so they lay him on a chunk of ice with a towel over him. And it's all very funny. But then, of course, oh, it happens in real life later. And apparently, to spread body heat to somebody who's got hypothermia actually involves necessarily penetration, even if they seem to be unconscious, which I think is what happens in this movie. So it's just, I don't know, someone needs to talk because I'm, my brain is falling out of my head as I try to make sense of it. And many people have warned me, like, just don't think about that part.
