{"text": " What kind of contribution to civic life does that make? How does that interact with the whole urban environment? I think what the Dill Pickle Club did for Chicago, and there were predecessor art colonies as well, too. The art colony on 57th Street that was established right around the town of the Columbian Exposition and was there for 65 years. Old Town, of course, is another good example of this. They give the city that kind of informal place for not just socializing, kind of conversation about arts and culture. It's great to go into a fancy, wonderful neoclassical building sanctioned by wealthy philanthropists and investors. But there's also kind of that, and we see that today in Chicago as well, too, also that place for informal, less structured opportunity. Here's this older building. You walk, as they say, you step low and you come into the Dill Pickle Club. And, of course, we have no radio recordings. We have no other recordings of it. But it's still very much a part of the city's consciousness. And actually, now there's a Dill Pickle organization in Portland, Oregon. Of all places, it kind of seeks to capture that kind of bohemian cosmopolitanism in the city. And now, of course, in 2017, you could find a million groups like this. But it was quite novel. And almost nothing remains today of Tower Town. It's all kind of upscale living. Single room occupancy hotels are gone. But the Dill Pickle really gave it that kind of sense of here's this kind of unsanctioned informal space. And as a result, Dill Pickle Club doesn't show up in the Chicago Tribune or the Chicago Daily News or the other papers of the period because it's on the fringes, which I think is really great. That is really interesting. So what does remain? You said there aren't very many recordings. We have all these records. What are they? Well, it's interesting. I'm sitting in front of a few of them right now with you. We have programs about some of their plays. I'll take a look at this document from 1927, which announces to us the Dill Pickle Clubhouse and Chapel. It always had different names. And one of the controversies among literati was a Dill Pickle with one L or two Ls. We won't get into that. It's too intense. Very fraught with problems. But they announced three one-act plays, Theodore Dreiser's The Girl in the Coffin, which was not a household play name then or now, even though Theodore Dreiser, of course, is well known. Pendleton King's Cocaine. Pedrick Pierce's The Singer. Weeknight's 8.30 p.m. And there's a little drawing on it of where Tooker Place was for the uninitiated pre-Google Maps, obviously. And at the bottom it says, Well, worthwhile. So it gives you one sense of what one of the activities that would have been going on there. We'll put some of these documents on the website when we upload the podcast. So if you are curious and want to see them, we'll have an image for you. And one that also is they weren't afraid of shying away from some of the more controversial political issues of the time as well. I have in my hand an announcement for a January 4th lecture from 1925 that promises Elmer L. Williams discussing, Will Chicago elect a racketeer mayor? With Thompson, Barrett, Lyle, Albert, Cermak, the friends and enemies of these candidates will raise a row that no pineapple explosion could drown. Jack Jones' first choice is Al Capone. Second, Thompson. Dale Pickle Club. And while you will know Al Capone, some folks might know that as he referred to William Hale Thompson, the mayor of Chicago. And the same brochure also promises a other variety of conversations and discussions. And again, these were, you know, if you were an adult these times and kind of a, say we say a free thinker, you'd come on out for one of their lectures. And at various times they offered food. Sometimes they used the euphemism tea room, which of course was used during prohibition so that people could come and get alcohol. And by the early 30s, the Dale Pickle Club had basically kind of run its course. But it was, I think that's the other kind of thinking about the ephemeral nature of cities as people had moved on to other things. Some people had moved on to New York, some of the poets and other writers, and the moment had passed. So it was very, you know, 15 years or so in the city's history, but a pretty fruitful period. And one where fortunate to have at the Newberry, all these documents and handbills that give a sense of what was it like to be. I personally would love to see a play or production, you know, kind of speculative based on what would it be like a night at the Dale Pickle Club? I think it'd be a wonderful project. Yeah. And it's very political inherently. Yeah. Inherently very political. And lots of conversations about, you know, difficult topics, sex education, role of women in society. And it's not to say that other folks weren't having these conversations. These were, but they really, got a lot of interesting people. University of Chicago professors showed up to debate professors from Northwestern. So you did get, you had high and low there, which I think increasingly unusual in cities. Oh, so you have a lot of other things with you. What was the, what else was fascinating to you about the Dale Pickle Club? Well, as I was looking through them, there's, it's such a, there's such an interesting set of items on their handbills and flyers and programs. And one of the other ones that really spoke to me was a promised lecture. And this was kind of a common topic for them, mostly to stir the pot. If we think of how people stir the pot today, online announcement, viral content. This announcement from 1923, possibly 1928, exact provenance unknown, promises a lecture on sex worship in boldface type by Mr. Samuel W. Ball, noted scholar and scientist and man of the world. Each lecture illustrated, you would imagine projected images at this point. And of course, in the keeping with the hyperbole, they also promise it is the most amazing series of lecture ever given in Chicago. So. Most amazing. Yeah, there can be without peer, basically. Like that's, that's kind of it. And it's interesting, the back of this particular document also features upcoming attractions. June 20th, the slave woman. Conversations about sexual ideas about the formation of the world. Following in the fall, phallic worship, the arrow. So they didn't, they didn't shy away from the difficult topics. And, you know, we don't have any sense of how many people are in attendance. We don't have, you know, big or small data on any of these things, but it's kind of interesting to speculate. It was a small space. It wasn't a huge, you know, auditorium, theater type of place, but you can see and imagine there were some lively conversations that took place. Yeah. It's interesting that you're mentioning how ephemeral this kind of is, yet it's definitely has a continuation to today's sort of. People are fascinated by it. I mean, you know, I haven't looked on another arbiter of our times, you know, to see if there are YouTube videos about it, reenactments from the dill pickle club, but it wouldn't, it wouldn't shock me. I mean, as I say, there's a group in Portland, Oregon that publishes these little chapbooks inspired by the dill pickle clubs. Kind of wanderings and programs. And, you know, it's, it's hard to think about in a city that's changing so much. And, you know, of course the conversations about gentrification in Chicago, like, you know, where can these places still exist, you know, low barriers to entry in terms of rent, you know, reusable spaces, you know, kind of what will be the next place where this will, this will happen or be able to happen in the city. So. Right. That's an interesting point you bring about up about place. So. White communities interact with their spaces. And so the dill pickle club had a physical space, but also. Came in and out of it. So how do people like the dill pickle club impact the urban infrastructure? It's interesting. You know, you can't point to anything. They don't have an honorary street sign. They don't have a piece of public art in the Clark and Dearborn station, which would be close to the, where the pickle club was. So it is more something that really exists in kind of the, the, the ether surrounding that aspect of Chicago's cultural history. Because most of the buildings they would have inhabited. And I've been doing some recent research on this for another project using these archives and a couple books published during the period about the near North community is most of it's gone. Either demolished for other buildings in the sixties and seventies. And the other place they talk about, you know, the tower in the tower town, which is this neighborhood they inhabited is the water. The original Chicago water tower, which was surrounded by other older, small buildings. And all of those buildings are gone as well, too. A lot of notable artists used to live there as well. And of course, all of this is mostly gone. Function of how cities grow and change, right. Replaced with not surprisingly skyscrapers and, you know, probably the other famous water tower, the vertical mall water tower place. So looking for it, looking in for the actual buildings is very tough. There's not much left of it right in our area. But I always like to see that the spirit lives on in different groups and organizations that were inspired by these initial kind of pioneers in the city. We were talking about built environment and the way people interact with it and the relationship to ephemeral life in cities. So like conversations and whatnot, but to what extent do those come to mind? Together? Like how is the built environment also ephemeral? Is my main question. Well, if you think about cities inherently are always in a state of renewal and rebirth. And any city that doesn't do this will not continue to be a successful city. We value historic districts, buildings that speak to the character and culture of our places. You know, all that is solid melts into air at some point or another. A good example of this is the Illinois Central Station, which used to be on Roosevelt Road, which was demolished in 1974. Chicago, railroad capital of the United States then and now, really since the certainly the late 19th century. And by 1925, there were six major passenger train stations in and around the state. To testimony to the fact that there were hundreds of inner city trains, intercity trains that came in and out of the city every day, taking people all over. Illinois Central Station had been finished in 1893 to serve the World's Fair. And it did a very good job of that and helped serve the World's Fair. And of course, over its 80 odd years of history, it also became very well known as being a place where African-Americans coming up from the South. Deposited their bags and started a new life. So lots of different moments. The building was not beloved. Famously, Louis Sullivan had some very harsh words about the building in his book, Kindergarten Chats. And he refers to this building, which is, you know, a ponderous limestone building. Many of them still in and around the loop in Chicago like it. Not with not for trains, obviously. He said the bill he referred to the building. This droll and fantastical parody upon logic. This finical mass of difficulties. This web of contradiction. This blatant fallacy. This repellent and indurated mess. This canker on the tongue of natural speech. Why does not the lake engulf it? Why does not the fire from heaven consume it? Is there no sane tribunal on earth? It must be that the lake is too busy and that the Lord of Heaven is too busy. So Louis Sullivan. Harsh words. Harsh words. Some might call it the sickest of burns. Some might call it that. So he was not a fan. But the building, you know, served its purpose well. And there were proposals over time, especially in the second decade of the 20th century, for the older building, finished in 1893, to be torn down and reconstructed anew. Transformation of the built environment with conversations about why don't we consolidate all passenger, intercity passenger train activity at one station. It will make it easier. It seems the more efficient way. Of course, we know that humans and private companies like large railroad companies don't always get along or agree. So it never happened. And planning for the demolition started in 1972 after the first, the last train left. The question was, what do you do with this hulky monstrosity? And people were leaving Chicago at that point. Tens of thousands throughout the 70s and 80s. So there wasn't a conversation of let's build new condos. Now the site is, you know, there's a couple skyscrapers, residential condos, skyscrapers on the site. In the 70s, there was no one talking about, they were talking about what, yeah, they were talking about what to do with this old hulking monstrosity. And Illinois Central obviously had just gotten out of the passenger railroad business and Amtrak had been created the year before. There wasn't much that was going to be due. There was very little interest in repurposing the building. Sounds sort of like the opposite of if you build it, they will come. Right. If they don't use it, there's no point in having a building, right? Yeah. And I mean, it had definitely, you know, it was very well worn. There were some concerns about its structural integrity. And, you know, the only thing that was really preserved when it was demolished in 1974 were the actual platforms. Which were used for three more decades just for regular train, metro trains. So part of that was preserved, but the building was demolished. And of course, there are lots of interesting conversations in the files here at the Newberry for the Illinois Central Railroad about what should we do with some of the stuff. There's a couple internal memos. I'm looking at one right now asking for what should we do about the bronze tablets that commemorated the people who lost their lives in the service during World War II. And other kind of aspects. There's a letter, interestingly enough, there's a letter in the files from a Dr. George Feinstein from Brooklyn who writes in, I should put it in, writes in by hand. It's a letter from June 6, 1974, who says, I have read that the Illinois Central is demolishing the Central Station in Chicago. This building includes a clock tower having a tower clock with a gravity escapement. I am interested in and study clocks. And if so, who should be contacted concerning this matter? So a nice polite letter from the good doctor in Brooklyn. And he receives a reply from the Director of Public Relations from the railroad who says it has already been sold in part. So a little too late on that one.

How does that interact with the whole urban environment? I think what the Dill Pickle Club did for Chicago, and there were predecessor art colonies as well, too. The art colony on 57th Street that was established right around the town of the Columbian Exposition and was there for 65 years. Old Town, of course, is another good example of this. They give the city that kind of informal place for not just socializing, kind of conversation about arts and culture. It's great to go into a fancy, wonderful neoclassical building sanctioned by wealthy philanthropists and investors. But there's also kind of that, and we see that today in Chicago as well, too, also that place for informal, less structured opportunity. Here's this older building. You walk, as they say, you step low and you come into the Dill Pickle Club. And, of course, we have no radio recordings. We have no other recordings of it. But it's still very much a part of the city's consciousness. And actually, now there's a Dill Pickle organization in Portland, Oregon. Of all places, it kind of seeks to capture that kind of bohemian cosmopolitanism in the city. And now, of course, in 2017, you could find a million groups like this. But it was quite novel. And almost nothing remains today of Tower Town. It's all kind of upscale living. Single room occupancy hotels are gone. But the Dill Pickle really gave it that kind of sense of here's this kind of unsanctioned informal space. And as a result, Dill Pickle Club doesn't show up in the Chicago Tribune or the Chicago Daily News or the other papers of the period because it's on the fringes, which I think is really great. That is really interesting. So what does remain? You said there aren't very many recordings. We have all these records. What are they? Well, it's interesting. I'm sitting in front of a few of them right now with you. We have programs about some of their plays. I'll take a look at this document from 1927, which announces to us the Dill Pickle Clubhouse and Chapel. It always had different names. And one of the controversies among literati was a Dill Pickle with one L or two Ls. We won't get into that. It's too intense. Very fraught with problems. But they announced three one-act plays, Theodore Dreiser's The Girl in the Coffin, which was not a household play name then or now, even though Theodore Dreiser, of course, is well known. Pendleton King's Cocaine. Pedrick Pierce's The Singer. Weeknight's 8.30 p.m. And there's a little drawing on it of where Tooker Place was for the uninitiated pre-Google Maps, obviously. And at the bottom it says, Well, worthwhile. So it gives you one sense of what one of the activities that would have been going on there. We'll put some of these documents on the website when we upload the podcast. So if you are curious and want to see them, we'll have an image for you. And one that also is they weren't afraid of shying away from some of the more controversial political issues of the time as well. I have in my hand an announcement for a January 4th lecture from 1925 that promises Elmer L. Williams discussing, Will Chicago elect a racketeer mayor? With Thompson, Barrett, Lyle, Albert, Cermak, the friends and enemies of these candidates will raise a row that no pineapple explosion could drown. Jack Jones' first choice is Al Capone. Second, Thompson. Dale Pickle Club. And while you will know Al Capone, some folks might know that as he referred to William Hale Thompson, the mayor of Chicago. And the same brochure also promises a other variety of conversations and discussions. And again, these were, you know, if you were an adult these times and kind of a, say we say a free thinker, you'd come on out for one of their lectures. And at various times they offered food. Sometimes they used the euphemism tea room, which of course was used during prohibition so that people could come and get alcohol. And by the early 30s, the Dale Pickle Club had basically kind of run its course. But it was, I think that's the other kind of thinking about the ephemeral nature of cities as people had moved on to other things. Some people had moved on to New York, some of the poets and other writers, and the moment had passed. So it was very, you know, 15 years or so in the city's history, but a pretty fruitful period. And one where fortunate to have at the Newberry, all these documents and handbills that give a sense of what was it like to be. I personally would love to see a play or production, you know, kind of speculative based on what would it be like a night at the Dale Pickle Club? I think it'd be a wonderful project. Yeah. And it's very political inherently. Yeah. Inherently very political. And lots of conversations about, you know, difficult topics, sex education, role of women in society. And it's not to say that other folks weren't having these conversations. These were, but they really, got a lot of interesting people. University of Chicago professors showed up to debate professors from Northwestern. So you did get, you had high and low there, which I think increasingly unusual in cities. Oh, so you have a lot of other things with you. What was the, what else was fascinating to you about the Dale Pickle Club? Well, as I was looking through them, there's, it's such a, there's such an interesting set of items on their handbills and flyers and programs. And one of the other ones that really spoke to me was a promised lecture. And this was kind of a common topic for them, mostly to stir the pot. If we think of how people stir the pot today, online announcement, viral content. This announcement from 1923, possibly 1928, exact provenance unknown, promises a lecture on sex worship in boldface type by Mr. Samuel W. Ball, noted scholar and scientist and man of the world. Each lecture illustrated, you would imagine projected images at this point. And of course, in the keeping with the hyperbole, they also promise it is the most amazing series of lecture ever given in Chicago. So. Most amazing. Yeah, there can be without peer, basically. Like that's, that's kind of it. And it's interesting, the back of this particular document also features upcoming attractions. June 20th, the slave woman. Conversations about sexual ideas about the formation of the world. Following in the fall, phallic worship, the arrow. So they didn't, they didn't shy away from the difficult topics. And, you know, we don't have any sense of how many people are in attendance. We don't have, you know, big or small data on any of these things, but it's kind of interesting to speculate. It was a small space. It wasn't a huge, you know, auditorium, theater type of place, but you can see and imagine there were some lively conversations that took place. Yeah. It's interesting that you're mentioning how ephemeral this kind of is, yet it's definitely has a continuation to today's sort of. People are fascinated by it. I mean, you know, I haven't looked on another arbiter of our times, you know, to see if there are YouTube videos about it, reenactments from the dill pickle club, but it wouldn't, it wouldn't shock me. I mean, as I say, there's a group in Portland, Oregon that publishes these little chapbooks inspired by the dill pickle clubs. Kind of wanderings and programs. And, you know, it's, it's hard to think about in a city that's changing so much. And, you know, of course the conversations about gentrification in Chicago, like, you know, where can these places still exist, you know, low barriers to entry in terms of rent, you know, reusable spaces, you know, kind of what will be the next place where this will, this will happen or be able to happen in the city. So. Right. That's an interesting point you bring about up about place. So. White communities interact with their spaces. And so the dill pickle club had a physical space, but also. Came in and out of it. So how do people like the dill pickle club impact the urban infrastructure? It's interesting. You know, you can't point to anything. They don't have an honorary street sign. They don't have a piece of public art in the Clark and Dearborn station, which would be close to the, where the pickle club was. So it is more something that really exists in kind of the, the, the ether surrounding that aspect of Chicago's cultural history. Because most of the buildings they would have inhabited. And I've been doing some recent research on this for another project using these archives and a couple books published during the period about the near North community is most of it's gone. Either demolished for other buildings in the sixties and seventies. And the other place they talk about, you know, the tower in the tower town, which is this neighborhood they inhabited is the water. The original Chicago water tower, which was surrounded by other older, small buildings. And all of those buildings are gone as well, too. A lot of notable artists used to live there as well. And of course, all of this is mostly gone. Function of how cities grow and change, right. Replaced with not surprisingly skyscrapers and, you know, probably the other famous water tower, the vertical mall water tower place. So looking for it, looking in for the actual buildings is very tough. There's not much left of it right in our area. But I always like to see that the spirit lives on in different groups and organizations that were inspired by these initial kind of pioneers in the city. We were talking about built environment and the way people interact with it and the relationship to ephemeral life in cities. So like conversations and whatnot, but to what extent do those come to mind? Together? Like how is the built environment also ephemeral? Is my main question. Well, if you think about cities inherently are always in a state of renewal and rebirth. And any city that doesn't do this will not continue to be a successful city. We value historic districts, buildings that speak to the character and culture of our places. You know, all that is solid melts into air at some point or another. A good example of this is the Illinois Central Station, which used to be on Roosevelt Road, which was demolished in 1974. Chicago, railroad capital of the United States then and now, really since the certainly the late 19th century. And by 1925, there were six major passenger train stations in and around the state. To testimony to the fact that there were hundreds of inner city trains, intercity trains that came in and out of the city every day, taking people all over. Illinois Central Station had been finished in 1893 to serve the World's Fair. And it did a very good job of that and helped serve the World's Fair. And of course, over its 80 odd years of history, it also became very well known as being a place where African-Americans coming up from the South. Deposited their bags and started a new life. So lots of different moments. The building was not beloved. Famously, Louis Sullivan had some very harsh words about the building in his book, Kindergarten Chats. And he refers to this building, which is, you know, a ponderous limestone building. Many of them still in and around the loop in Chicago like it. Not with not for trains, obviously. He said the bill he referred to the building. This droll and fantastical parody upon logic. This finical mass of difficulties. This web of contradiction. This blatant fallacy. This repellent and indurated mess. This canker on the tongue of natural speech. Why does not the lake engulf it? Why does not the fire from heaven consume it? Is there no sane tribunal on earth? It must be that the lake is too busy and that the Lord of Heaven is too busy. So Louis Sullivan. Harsh words. Harsh words. Some might call it the sickest of burns. Some might call it that. So he was not a fan. But the building, you know, served its purpose well. And there were proposals over time, especially in the second decade of the 20th century, for the older building, finished in 1893, to be torn down and reconstructed anew. Transformation of the built environment with conversations about why don't we consolidate all passenger, intercity passenger train activity at one station. It will make it easier. It seems the more efficient way. Of course, we know that humans and private companies like large railroad companies don't always get along or agree. So it never happened. And planning for the demolition started in 1972 after the first, the last train left. The question was, what do you do with this hulky monstrosity? And people were leaving Chicago at that point. Tens of thousands throughout the 70s and 80s. So there wasn't a conversation of let's build new condos. Now the site is, you know, there's a couple skyscrapers, residential condos, skyscrapers on the site. In the 70s, there was no one talking about, they were talking about what, yeah, they were talking about what to do with this old hulking monstrosity. And Illinois Central obviously had just gotten out of the passenger railroad business and Amtrak had been created the year before. There wasn't much that was going to be due. There was very little interest in repurposing the building. Sounds sort of like the opposite of if you build it, they will come. Right. If they don't use it, there's no point in having a building, right? Yeah. And I mean, it had definitely, you know, it was very well worn. There were some concerns about its structural integrity. And, you know, the only thing that was really preserved when it was demolished in 1974 were the actual platforms. Which were used for three more decades just for regular train, metro trains. So part of that was preserved, but the building was demolished. And of course, there are lots of interesting conversations in the files here at the Newberry for the Illinois Central Railroad about what should we do with some of the stuff. There's a couple internal memos. I'm looking at one right now asking for what should we do about the bronze tablets that commemorated the people who lost their lives in the service during World War II. And other kind of aspects. There's a letter, interestingly enough, there's a letter in the files from a Dr. George Feinstein from Brooklyn who writes in, I should put it in, writes in by hand. It's a letter from June 6, 1974, who says, I have read that the Illinois Central is demolishing the Central Station in Chicago. This building includes a clock tower having a tower clock with a gravity escapement. I am interested in and study clocks. And if so, who should be contacted concerning this matter? So a nice polite letter from the good doctor in Brooklyn. And he receives a reply from the Director of Public Relations from the railroad who says it has already been sold in part. So a little too late on that one.
