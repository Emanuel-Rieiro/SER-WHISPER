{"text": " Stephen, how are you? I am doing well, Mike. Good to talk to you. It's very good to talk to you. What's going on in Ottawa these days? Well, it's nice and crisp out. Nice fall day, as it were. What is new with the weather in Toronto? The weather right now is about 19 and cloudy, just like Amanda Bynes. But that's a good story. But no, this is very exciting. This is the premiere, the big debut of a podcast that I think we want to do at least once a week to talk about television and sports and anything interesting going on in the world. And I can't think of a better person to do it with than yourself. Well, thank you. Enough kissing our asses, though. Let's try and move on. On today's show, we're going to be talking about the NFL replacement referees and the disaster that has been. We'll touch on the NHL lockout as well and how bleak that is looking. And also the Emmy Awards were on Sunday night. You and I, Stephen, are both avid TV watchers. Yep. So we'll break down some of the most important moments from Sunday's broadcast. But what happened on Sunday night does not compare in the slightest to what happened a mere 24 hours later. This is deciding who wins the game on this call. The call on the field stands. Touchdown. Seahawks win in the most bizarre finish you'll ever see. We'll talk about an understatement. I think so. Honestly, I mean, that that was something else. And, you know, it would have to be close to impossible for everyone to not have heard by now the controversy going on in the NFL. So far this season, you know, the league has been using these replacement referees due to a referee lockout. You know, there there have been a ton of blown calls, a ton of missed calls. But what happened in the final seconds of the Monday night or this week, which you just heard between the Packers and the Seahawks, was definitely the breaking point. I think, honestly, enough is enough. What happened on Monday night is very much the straw that I think broke the NFL's back. I think at this point it has to be done when you have two officials signaling different. That was the funny part of it, wasn't it? And that having. Yeah, they look at each other. They look down to the players. They look at each other and then they make two separate calls. Like, can it get more ridiculous than that? Really? I mean, that's the image we're always going to remember now. Right. Yeah. Two referees standing in the end zone, one saying it's an interception, one saying it's a touchdown. So, you know, every call that has been blown or missed before this was was definitely a joke. But when a replacement referee turns a win into a loss, that that's the integrity of the game going down the drain. And I think the league has really been erupting into chaos now, wouldn't you say, Steve? And I mean, that's really what it comes down to for the league is, is this turning into a joke? I mean, again, it was penalty call against the coach for coming out into the field when he was trying to call a timeout. That's right. Yeah, it's just. And the other odd part was that it it seems to be getting worse. You know, you would think that as these referees who, by the way, have come out of Division three NCAA and, you know, the ranks of high school football. So you would think that as the weeks go on, they would get better. But obviously, the games have gotten worse and more ridiculous in terms of calls. If you look at that fourth quarter, Packers, Seahawks, there was almost a flag on every single play. They can't seem to decide on what is passing offensive pass interference and defensive pass interference. It's just getting to be a farce at this point. Yeah. And you know what? Watching these games, the replacement refs actually look lost out there. They are clearly more than a step or two behind. They seem rattled. You know, sometimes I've been wondering if they've ever seen the sport played before. But at the same time, as you just mentioned, they are not professionals. They are not the NFL standard. So as much as it's hard not to yell at the refs when you're watching these games, I think we should all be yelling at Roger Goodell and how he doesn't seem even at this point bothered enough to stop this madness. It's getting worse and worse. How do you not absolutely just hate this guy right now? I mean, I agree. And for for a game that makes so much money, you have all these other sports that are in financial disarray right now. The NHL included from that. There's low attendance. The NBA is just coming off a lockout. All these other labor negotiations and strife. And the NFL is the one league that is consistently all teams are making money. They have massive television contract revenues and profits, you know, sky high. And they can't seem to get this sorted out with their referees. It's a bit of a joke, to be honest. It's the greatest league in all of sports. And you think about how rich their history is and how many years it's taken to earn this reputation. And now it's all crumbled. It's crumbling down as if nothing matters. And small little anecdote about where these referees are coming from. And this is absolutely true. Not a joke. There was an article posted. Well, it was on Yahoo.com. So take for that what you want. But the Lingerie Football League commissioner has mocked the NFL for its low officiating standards and that one of the referees that reffed the Baltimore New England game was a former referee from the Lingerie Football League. So what does that tell you? That is absolutely true. Wow. And that just goes to show you how big of a mess it is. Another issue, Steve, that I think we should talk about is that not only are these the calls being blown and missed, but I think the safety of the NFL is coming into question now the last few weeks. There have been some devastating hits and players who are delivering these hits see that they're not necessarily getting penalized and therefore feel like they can do whatever they want. It's one thing if the replacement referees are getting calls wrong. But when it's so much to the point where there is little to no control over the players on the field, I think that's a huge issue for player safety. And Aaron Rodgers echoed those sentiments. He gave an interview to a newspaper in Wisconsin yesterday and he said, we put our bodies, our livelihood on the line and you can't possibly tell me the way things are going right now that player safety is being held to the same standard it was. The same integrity of the game isn't what it was. And he goes on to say, the product that is on the field is not being complimented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control. And like I said in the first week, I'm okay with replacement refs as long as they don't have a direct impact on the game. Well, that has obviously changed by this third week, hasn't it? Absolutely. You know, another anecdote here, SportsCenter on ESPN following the game on Monday night had its highest ratings in 17 years. Wow. Talking about that Patriots-Ravens game, you know, Bill Belichick was actually fined for grabbing onto the referee. But at the same time, not that I'm defending any kind of action like that, but there's a sense of, even for the coaches, I can't remember who it was, but some coach was trying to call a timeout and he was penalized for it. Yeah, Harbaugh. Yeah. So it's like, there's just a sense of confusion among coaches and players that they can't even get a sense of what these referees are even talking about. One of the guys that creates the lines in Vegas was that they are having to change their odds to more increasingly favor the home team because they are finding that the refs, for whatever reason, you know, I'm sure some of them are obvious that if you're a new ref, you're, imagine if you're that ref in Seattle and the call on the field is a touchdown, you know, whether or not that call was actually right or wrong, which it was wrong. But the call on the field was a touchdown. Imagine if on Monday night, the winning touchdown, you now have to announce to the crowd that the call on the field was reversed, you know, which would have been the right call. But if you're a first time referee, probably his first Monday night game, that's got to be intimidating. And that's what I guess a lot of the odds makers are finding is that the home team is getting way less penalties than the away teams and are possibly getting intimidated by the large crowds and the coaches. Absolutely. Another thing to do with gambling, I heard that because of the results, on Monday night, close to $150 to $250 million shifted because of the line. Crazy. It's insane. And it's tough to talk about gambling when you're talking about the integrity of the game. But gambling is a huge thing for the NFL. If they didn't have gambling like that, the league wouldn't survive. Not to mention your fantasy football league. Absolutely, which could be less than $150 million, but still along the same lines. So now there's a Thursday night game between the Browns are playing that game. They are talking, I believe, but Roger Goodell had already planned this meeting before the Monday night mess. So do you really think, how long, maybe I should say this, how long does this continue? I don't foresee it ending this week and possibly even next week. But I think the league is pretty adamant in their stance. And they obviously haven't shown that they are affected by this call. It's unfortunate because the dollars that we're talking about are not a lot. And I think what the regular referees are asking for is just a full-time job. I mean, as it is now, they're getting paid per game. And for a league that makes so much money, it's unfortunate that it is that way. And so at least for me, I'm siding with the referees. But hopefully they can get this resolved sooner than later because it's getting out of hand. And you're right, it's destroying the integrity of the game. So for the non-Russians out there, which most of us are, that was Maxim Afinaganov scoring for SKA Dynamo, the game-winning goal against Dynamo Moscow in the KHL. Did you wait to watch that game, Steve? I did. It was on my NHL Center Ice International Package Edition, whatever. Oh, wow. Look at that. Well, at least we're seeing some hockey. But yeah, you do see some of those highlights on SportsCenter and the highlight shows. But to talk about the NHL lockout, they are meeting on Friday. It's almost annoying, isn't it, to have to talk about it? Yes. It's quite crazy how the NFL is going through what it's going through, which we just discussed. And now we discussed yet another lockout, which some of the spotlight actually was kind of taken from it because of the Monday night mess. But they are meeting again on Friday. But they're not discussing core economic issues on Friday. They're discussing stuff like grievances and medical stuff. So I'm not saying that the meeting is not going to be worth it. I think meeting is better than not meeting. But again, I think it looks very bleak in the sense that they are so far apart. And the players are used to a CBA. They want their salaries protected. So I think, honestly, decreasing the amount of money that they make in the first year of their contracts is an absolute no from the players. And I think that's really where you have to start. I think the NHL needs to find a way to complement their players without it seeming like they're just looking out for themselves. And until they kind of get away from the stance that they're taking advantage of the players or they're bullying them, I don't think any ground is going to be made. And honestly, the scary part about this lockout to me is that we're, I think, into the second week of it now, if not more. And they still are nowhere close on figuring out the economics of the game. But even once that's resolved, they have to figure out all these little ancillary things that were resolved in the last CBA. Things like whether or not you go to the Olympics. For the players, that's a big deal. Figuring out the maximum length of contracts. Figuring out the breakdown of contracts. Is the league going to allow in this CBA a Luongo-type deal, a Pronger-type deal? The league obviously doesn't want that, but the players obviously do. Things like at what age is the earliest you can file for unrestricted free agency? It's 25 right now. The league wants 30. Right now, entry-level deals are three years. The league wants five. So these are all other things that need to be worked out. And to be honest, I don't even think they've gotten to talking about those. Yes, absolutely. And honestly, it's very hard to hear all of these arguments every day when you watch the news and everything like that. But I think what the real shame is going to be is that for the last seven to eight years with the new CBA, the NHL has tried to grow the game in the United States. With Sidney Crosby, with Alexander Ovechkin, with players like that. I think it would be an absolute shame to not only just lose this season, but honestly, I don't think markets in the southern United States like Florida and Phoenix, how are they going to recover? They don't love hockey like Canadians do. We have a very captive audience in this country. The second the NHL comes back, we're all going to be watching. Whether it's next week or next season, we're all going to be watching. In Florida and these types of markets in the States where hockey has struggled for so long, taking an entire year off, how can you risk losing that fan base when it's been so hard to kind of make them love the game already? And those teams are sort of at the heart of these negotiations, right? Because it's those small market teams that are basically dragging the rest of the league down, sort of. And the players are all for revenue sharing, right? Because for them, if more teams can afford higher salaries, then it helps them as a whole, right? And can avoid all these comments from the owners that the league is doing badly when you have teams like Toronto and Philly and I guess now Minnesota handing out huge contracts. And it's tough to think how they're actually going to resolve this because they are so far apart. So actually thinking of a detailed way of, hey, maybe they can do this or maybe they can do this. It's hard to even think of an idea or a concept where both parties can be satisfied.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.64, "text": " Stephen, how are you?", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [13391, 11,

"ori_dict": {"text": " Stephen, how are you? I am doing well, Mike. Good to talk to you. It's very good to talk to you. What's going on in Ottawa these days? Well, it's nice and crisp out. Nice fall day, as it were. What is new with the weather in Toronto? The weather right now is about 19 and cloudy, just like Amanda Bynes. But that's a good story. But no, this is very exciting. This is the premiere, the big debut of a podcast that I think we want to do at least once a week to talk about television and sports and anything interesting going on in the world. And I can't think of a better person to do it with than yourself. Well, thank you. Enough kissing our asses, though. Let's try and move on. On today's show, we're going to be talking about the NFL replacement referees and the disaster that has been. We'll touch on the NHL lockout as well and how bleak that is looking. And also the Emmy Awards were on Sunday night. You and I, Stephen, are both avid TV watchers. Yep. So we'll break down some of the most important moments from Sunday's broadcast. But what happened on Sunday night does not compare in the slightest to what happened a mere 24 hours later. This is deciding who wins the game on this call. The call on the field stands. Touchdown. Seahawks win in the most bizarre finish you'll ever see. We'll talk about an understatement. I think so. Honestly, I mean, that that was something else. And, you know, it would have to be close to impossible for everyone to not have heard by now the controversy going on in the NFL. So far this season, you know, the league has been using these replacement referees due to a referee lockout. You know, there there have been a ton of blown calls, a ton of missed calls. But what happened in the final seconds of the Monday night or this week, which you just heard between the Packers and the Seahawks, was definitely the breaking point. I think, honestly, enough is enough. What happened on Monday night is very much the straw that I think broke the NFL's back. I think at this point it has to be done when you have two officials signaling different. That was the funny part of it, wasn't it? And that having. Yeah, they look at each other. They look down to the players. They look at each other and then they make two separate calls. Like, can it get more ridiculous than that? Really? I mean, that's the image we're always going to remember now. Right. Yeah. Two referees standing in the end zone, one saying it's an interception, one saying it's a touchdown. So, you know, every call that has been blown or missed before this was was definitely a joke. But when a replacement referee turns a win into a loss, that that's the integrity of the game going down the drain. And I think the league has really been erupting into chaos now, wouldn't you say, Steve? And I mean, that's really what it comes down to for the league is, is this turning into a joke? I mean, again, it was penalty call against the coach for coming out into the field when he was trying to call a timeout. That's right. Yeah, it's just. And the other odd part was that it it seems to be getting worse. You know, you would think that as these referees who, by the way, have come out of Division three NCAA and, you know, the ranks of high school football. So you would think that as the weeks go on, they would get better. But obviously, the games have gotten worse and more ridiculous in terms of calls. If you look at that fourth quarter, Packers, Seahawks, there was almost a flag on every single play. They can't seem to decide on what is passing offensive pass interference and defensive pass interference. It's just getting to be a farce at this point. Yeah. And you know what? Watching these games, the replacement refs actually look lost out there. They are clearly more than a step or two behind. They seem rattled. You know, sometimes I've been wondering if they've ever seen the sport played before. But at the same time, as you just mentioned, they are not professionals. They are not the NFL standard. So as much as it's hard not to yell at the refs when you're watching these games, I think we should all be yelling at Roger Goodell and how he doesn't seem even at this point bothered enough to stop this madness. It's getting worse and worse. How do you not absolutely just hate this guy right now? I mean, I agree. And for for a game that makes so much money, you have all these other sports that are in financial disarray right now. The NHL included from that. There's low attendance. The NBA is just coming off a lockout. All these other labor negotiations and strife. And the NFL is the one league that is consistently all teams are making money. They have massive television contract revenues and profits, you know, sky high. And they can't seem to get this sorted out with their referees. It's a bit of a joke, to be honest. It's the greatest league in all of sports. And you think about how rich their history is and how many years it's taken to earn this reputation. And now it's all crumbled. It's crumbling down as if nothing matters. And small little anecdote about where these referees are coming from. And this is absolutely true. Not a joke. There was an article posted. Well, it was on Yahoo.com. So take for that what you want. But the Lingerie Football League commissioner has mocked the NFL for its low officiating standards and that one of the referees that reffed the Baltimore New England game was a former referee from the Lingerie Football League. So what does that tell you? That is absolutely true. Wow. And that just goes to show you how big of a mess it is. Another issue, Steve, that I think we should talk about is that not only are these the calls being blown and missed, but I think the safety of the NFL is coming into question now the last few weeks. There have been some devastating hits and players who are delivering these hits see that they're not necessarily getting penalized and therefore feel like they can do whatever they want. It's one thing if the replacement referees are getting calls wrong. But when it's so much to the point where there is little to no control over the players on the field, I think that's a huge issue for player safety. And Aaron Rodgers echoed those sentiments. He gave an interview to a newspaper in Wisconsin yesterday and he said, we put our bodies, our livelihood on the line and you can't possibly tell me the way things are going right now that player safety is being held to the same standard it was. The same integrity of the game isn't what it was. And he goes on to say, the product that is on the field is not being complimented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control. And like I said in the first week, I'm okay with replacement refs as long as they don't have a direct impact on the game. Well, that has obviously changed by this third week, hasn't it? Absolutely. You know, another anecdote here, SportsCenter on ESPN following the game on Monday night had its highest ratings in 17 years. Wow. Talking about that Patriots-Ravens game, you know, Bill Belichick was actually fined for grabbing onto the referee. But at the same time, not that I'm defending any kind of action like that, but there's a sense of, even for the coaches, I can't remember who it was, but some coach was trying to call a timeout and he was penalized for it. Yeah, Harbaugh. Yeah. So it's like, there's just a sense of confusion among coaches and players that they can't even get a sense of what these referees are even talking about. One of the guys that creates the lines in Vegas was that they are having to change their odds to more increasingly favor the home team because they are finding that the refs, for whatever reason, you know, I'm sure some of them are obvious that if you're a new ref, you're, imagine if you're that ref in Seattle and the call on the field is a touchdown, you know, whether or not that call was actually right or wrong, which it was wrong. But the call on the field was a touchdown. Imagine if on Monday night, the winning touchdown, you now have to announce to the crowd that the call on the field was reversed, you know, which would have been the right call. But if you're a first time referee, probably his first Monday night game, that's got to be intimidating. And that's what I guess a lot of the odds makers are finding is that the home team is getting way less penalties than the away teams and are possibly getting intimidated by the large crowds and the coaches. Absolutely. Another thing to do with gambling, I heard that because of the results, on Monday night, close to $150 to $250 million shifted because of the line. Crazy. It's insane. And it's tough to talk about gambling when you're talking about the integrity of the game. But gambling is a huge thing for the NFL. If they didn't have gambling like that, the league wouldn't survive. Not to mention your fantasy football league. Absolutely, which could be less than $150 million, but still along the same lines. So now there's a Thursday night game between the Browns are playing that game. They are talking, I believe, but Roger Goodell had already planned this meeting before the Monday night mess. So do you really think, how long, maybe I should say this, how long does this continue? I don't foresee it ending this week and possibly even next week. But I think the league is pretty adamant in their stance. And they obviously haven't shown that they are affected by this call. It's unfortunate because the dollars that we're talking about are not a lot. And I think what the regular referees are asking for is just a full-time job. I mean, as it is now, they're getting paid per game. And for a league that makes so much money, it's unfortunate that it is that way. And so at least for me, I'm siding with the referees. But hopefully they can get this resolved sooner than later because it's getting out of hand. And you're right, it's destroying the integrity of the game. So for the non-Russians out there, which most of us are, that was Maxim Afinaganov scoring for SKA Dynamo, the game-winning goal against Dynamo Moscow in the KHL. Did you wait to watch that game, Steve? I did. It was on my NHL Center Ice International Package Edition, whatever. Oh, wow. Look at that. Well, at least we're seeing some hockey. But yeah, you do see some of those highlights on SportsCenter and the highlight shows. But to talk about the NHL lockout, they are meeting on Friday. It's almost annoying, isn't it, to have to talk about it? Yes. It's quite crazy how the NFL is going through what it's going through, which we just discussed. And now we discussed yet another lockout, which some of the spotlight actually was kind of taken from it because of the Monday night mess. But they are meeting again on Friday. But they're not discussing core economic issues on Friday. They're discussing stuff like grievances and medical stuff. So I'm not saying that the meeting is not going to be worth it. I think meeting is better than not meeting. But again, I think it looks very bleak in the sense that they are so far apart. And the players are used to a CBA. They want their salaries protected. So I think, honestly, decreasing the amount of money that they make in the first year of their contracts is an absolute no from the players. And I think that's really where you have to start. I think the NHL needs to find a way to complement their players without it seeming like they're just looking out for themselves. And until they kind of get away from the stance that they're taking advantage of the players or they're bullying them, I don't think any ground is going to be made. And honestly, the scary part about this lockout to me is that we're, I think, into the second week of it now, if not more. And they still are nowhere close on figuring out the economics of the game. But even once that's resolved, they have to figure out all these little ancillary things that were resolved in the last CBA. Things like whether or not you go to the Olympics. For the players, that's a big deal. Figuring out the maximum length of contracts. Figuring out the breakdown of contracts. Is the league going to allow in this CBA a Luongo-type deal, a Pronger-type deal? The league obviously doesn't want that, but the players obviously do. Things like at what age is the earliest you can file for unrestricted free agency? It's 25 right now. The league wants 30. Right now, entry-level deals are three years. The league wants five. So these are all other things that need to be worked out. And to be honest, I don't even think they've gotten to talking about those. Yes, absolutely. And honestly, it's very hard to hear all of these arguments every day when you watch the news and everything like that. But I think what the real shame is going to be is that for the last seven to eight years with the new CBA, the NHL has tried to grow the game in the United States. With Sidney Crosby, with Alexander Ovechkin, with players like that. I think it would be an absolute shame to not only just lose this season, but honestly, I don't think markets in the southern United States like Florida and Phoenix, how are they going to recover? They don't love hockey like Canadians do. We have a very captive audience in this country. The second the NHL comes back, we're all going to be watching. Whether it's next week or next season, we're all going to be watching. In Florida and these types of markets in the States where hockey has struggled for so long, taking an entire year off, how can you risk losing that fan base when it's been so hard to kind of make them love the game already? And those teams are sort of at the heart of these negotiations, right? Because it's those small market teams that are basically dragging the rest of the league down, sort of. And the players are all for revenue sharing, right? Because for them, if more teams can afford higher salaries, then it helps them as a whole, right? And can avoid all these comments from the owners that the league is doing badly when you have teams like Toronto and Philly and I guess now Minnesota handing out huge contracts. And it's tough to think how they're actually going to resolve this because they are so far apart. So actually thinking of a detailed way of, hey, maybe they can do this or maybe they can do this. It's hard to even think of an idea or a concept where both parties can be satisfied.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 0.64, "text": " Stephen, how are you?", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [13391, 11, 577, 366, 291, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14529319658671339, "compression_ratio": 1.6344086021505377, "no_speech_prob": 0.05919050797820091, "words": [{"word": " Stephen,", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.18, "probability": 0.57191401720047, "tokens": [13391, 11]}, {"word": " how", "start": 0.22, "end": 0.34, "probability": 0.999841570854187, "tokens": [577]}, {"word": " are", "start": 0.34, "end": 0.54, "probability": 0.9999889135360718, "tokens": [366]}, {"word": " you?", "start": 0.54, "end": 0.64, "probability": 0.9982484579086304, "tokens": [291, 30]}]}, {"id": 1, "start": 0.88, "end": 2.92, "text": " I am doing well, Mike.
