{"text": " there's a very specific moment that happened in that match that you won't see on the network anymore because they edited out. Yeah. But again, it's kind of a shock value moment that doesn't really have a place in modern wrestling anymore. And it's something I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on, but it's worth noting that it happened then and it still just showed that now that they're still not really taking this seriously. Exactly. Now to be fair, they're doing a lot of the same kind of stuff with the men too. It was a weird time. It was equal opportunity, but it's still just kind of a strange time for wrestling then. But because that kind of stuff is still going on, it only makes sense that we see the birth of the Diva Search, which the Diva Search gives us the Bellas. And today, the Bellas aren't the cornerstone of horrible women's wrestling as they used to be. I have gained a lot of respect for both of them over the last year or two probably. And it took a while. And now looking back, a lot of the blame doesn't really fall to them. No, they were... At the time, and this women's revolution special kind of shows that Bree was the one that really wanted to do it, really wanted to do the Diva Search because she, you know, who knows what her motivations were for wanting to do it, but Nikki was apparently going to go play soccer overseas. They always, on Total Divas, they always talk about Nikki playing soccer. And how she was so good at soccer. And I just always thought that that was fodder for them to talk about. Apparently that was a real thing. She was very good, a very good soccer player. So it almost feels like they do this Diva Search thing on a lark and ten years later, you know, they're... They're attractive fans. They have their place. Obviously, at that point in time, they were going to go pretty far. Exactly. And to both of their credit, they really worked and got a lot better when these actual talented wrestlers started coming up. And Alicia Fox has been with the company ten years. She's been around for a while and she's super athletic. And it's... It just... It seems like such a wasted opportunity for somebody like her that she's been around this long and hasn't been given anything to do up until right now with, you know, the stuff with Nia Jax. Has she had this talent before? I think she had it, but again... It didn't mean that much then. What does it matter? So the Diva Search happens, I guess, right around the time of one of the brand splits. And that's when we get the nasty pink butterfly Divas Championship. That belt is horrible. You know, it's... As WWEs want to do when they do a brand split, they want to have belts on both shows. So the Women's Championship is still around. The Divas Championship is born. And eventually, they are merged and the Divas Championship is the one that survives. And people want to complain about the Universal Championship belts look. Yeah. No. No. The Divas belt was... Right. Ugh. In this... In this era of women's wrestling, the standout, I guess, is probably Beth Phoenix. Beth Phoenix is awesome. And she was. And she had some... She had some girls she could work with that could really give her something. That, again, they didn't get a whole lot of opportunity. And she ends up, toward the end of her run, being more well-known for the stuff she was doing with Santino. Which was entertaining. It was certainly entertaining. But not what she came there for. And... But... Just to show what they were still thinking about women's wrestling at the time, they ended up doing, at WrestleMania 23, I want to say, they did... Santina. It was Santina Morella winning whatever women's brouhaha there was that night. So it was, again, just kind of reduced to comedy. Which is... You have Natty. And you have Beth Phoenix. And you can't come up with something. That's... It's a shame. It is. Yeah. Gail Kim was in that mix at one point. Gail Kim is fantastic, too. She was always really good and criminally underused, underutilized, misutilized. In WWE. Yeah. To TNA's credit. They had a stretch where they were doing better stuff with their women's division than WWE was doing with any of their roster. It was very compelling with her and Awesome Kong. They had a... They've got one of the best feuds of the last 10-12 years, I think. Yeah. At least for its time. WWE also had... Had Melina, who could do a few things in the ring. Michelle McCool was always really good. Didn't Melina and Michelle McCool get in trouble for having too good of a match? Yeah. That's the story. That they had a match at a pay-per-view where they were given seven or eight minutes. And they basically wrestled like they were guys. And had a really good match. It didn't particularly get over with the crowd because the crowd wasn't conditioned. To really expect anything good out of the women at that point. Because they hadn't been given the opportunity. So they, I guess, got crapped on backstage because of it after the fact. And then we go back to what we pretty much had for everything leading up to that point. So women's wrestling, I guess, for the longest time after that is still just kind of there. Natty ends up, for a while, not getting much opportunity. In the ring because she's running around with Great Khali. And then eventually gets lumped in. Not lumped in with Tyson Kidd and Cesaro. That ends up actually being a really nice trio. Yeah, I don't really count that. That was more of a... That made sense. And it was around the time that things were starting to turn for women's wrestling too. Because of NXT. Because of NXT. Which I asked the question earlier. Is women's wrestling becoming what women's wrestling is? Because all. Because Triple H has three female children. Is that it? Yeah, if Hunter had sired sons instead, would we be seeing Charlotte and Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks triple threat for the women's championship at WrestleMania 32 in front of 100,000 people? No, probably not. No, it's a very, very valid point. So that's very fair. He doesn't suddenly have three girls that he's looking at going, no, no, no, no, no. Women's wrestling is going to become a thing now. Because if they want to get into this business, they, no, they can't do that. So around the time that NXT kickstarts, the main roster looks something like this. You've got the Bellas who are still doing the twin magic stuff. Who are pretty horrible at that point. You've got AJ Lee who is with, whether she's with Daniel Bryan or John Cena or CM Punk or Kane. Yeah. She's kind of bouncing around from person to person. The adult, yeah. She's good in all those. I mean, she's good in everything she does. Sure. But. You've got like the one that was pregnant and hasn't been back. Rosa. Rosa Mendez. Rosa Mendez who, you know, whatever. And then. Oksana. Oksana was around. She was another one that. But they put her with Cesaro. Yeah. She was randomly with Cesaro and that didn't last very long. And then they had, I cannot think of her wrestling name. Her real name is Celeste. Oh. Caitlin. Caitlin. Caitlin. They had her in an angle where she farts. No, no. They did that to Natty. They did that to Natty. They did that to Natty. Oh, that hurts. So they did that thing and they did the Piggy James thing with Mickie James back in the day. And Caitlin was also considered a pig. I'm air quoting. Yeah. You can't see me. She had. I'm air quoting. She had what could potentially have been a decent feud with AJ Lee in the works and it became reduced to what she looked like. Yeah. And which is ridiculous because she's attractive. I don't understand. She's gorgeous. I don't get it. I don't get what the deal is there. Yeah. And for all the great things that they're doing with the women now, they still kind of do that kind of thing with Dana Brooke to a degree. Not nearly to the level that they do. They call her Miss Piggy. However, I don't, I don't think that that's actually a knock on like her weight or anything because Dana Brooke competes in these. Yeah. Muscle, these bodybuilding competitions. Right. It's, it's the blonde hair. It's, it's the actual. I guess, but I don't know. It's, they've just got such a history of. I think Miss Piggy is just getting a negative connotation here when Miss Piggy is fabulous. Well, she is. Have you seen the Muppet movies? She's the queen. She's the queen. Come on. But because of their history of how they talk about women, it makes sense that people would. It does. It does. Kind of be taken aback by that. Yeah. In the mix with those other ladies, you had the Funkadactyls. That's how Naomi got her start and she's in there with Cameron and Cameron of the Melina and Alicia Fox being the greatest women's match ever. Hit her on her stomach. Oh. You know, count it ref. Well, she's on her back. So she's, she, you know. Xavier Woods also got his start. Dancing with Brodus Clay. So. Yeah. And, and well more, I think it was more R-Truth than, but. Okay. Whichever. But it was along the same line. So there's not a lot. Oh, Tamina. Tamina's in that mix. And Tamina is another one who, I mean, she's, she has always kind of looked rough around the edges, but again, she's somebody that hasn't gotten a lot of opportunity to. Yeah. To wrestle consistently. So I've always wondered what she could do. If they'd give her more, more time. She's coming back from injury soon. So.

Yeah. But again, it's kind of a shock value moment that doesn't really have a place in modern wrestling anymore. And it's something I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on, but it's worth noting that it happened then and it still just showed that now that they're still not really taking this seriously. Exactly. Now to be fair, they're doing a lot of the same kind of stuff with the men too. It was a weird time. It was equal opportunity, but it's still just kind of a strange time for wrestling then. But because that kind of stuff is still going on, it only makes sense that we see the birth of the Diva Search, which the Diva Search gives us the Bellas. And today, the Bellas aren't the cornerstone of horrible women's wrestling as they used to be. I have gained a lot of respect for both of them over the last year or two probably. And it took a while. And now looking back, a lot of the blame doesn't really fall to them. No, they were... At the time, and this women's revolution special kind of shows that Bree was the one that really wanted to do it, really wanted to do the Diva Search because she, you know, who knows what her motivations were for wanting to do it, but Nikki was apparently going to go play soccer overseas. They always, on Total Divas, they always talk about Nikki playing soccer. And how she was so good at soccer. And I just always thought that that was fodder for them to talk about. Apparently that was a real thing. She was very good, a very good soccer player. So it almost feels like they do this Diva Search thing on a lark and ten years later, you know, they're... They're attractive fans. They have their place. Obviously, at that point in time, they were going to go pretty far. Exactly. And to both of their credit, they really worked and got a lot better when these actual talented wrestlers started coming up. And Alicia Fox has been with the company ten years. She's been around for a while and she's super athletic. And it's... It just... It seems like such a wasted opportunity for somebody like her that she's been around this long and hasn't been given anything to do up until right now with, you know, the stuff with Nia Jax. Has she had this talent before? I think she had it, but again... It didn't mean that much then. What does it matter? So the Diva Search happens, I guess, right around the time of one of the brand splits. And that's when we get the nasty pink butterfly Divas Championship. That belt is horrible. You know, it's... As WWEs want to do when they do a brand split, they want to have belts on both shows. So the Women's Championship is still around. The Divas Championship is born. And eventually, they are merged and the Divas Championship is the one that survives. And people want to complain about the Universal Championship belts look. Yeah. No. No. The Divas belt was... Right. Ugh. In this... In this era of women's wrestling, the standout, I guess, is probably Beth Phoenix. Beth Phoenix is awesome. And she was. And she had some... She had some girls she could work with that could really give her something. That, again, they didn't get a whole lot of opportunity. And she ends up, toward the end of her run, being more well-known for the stuff she was doing with Santino. Which was entertaining. It was certainly entertaining. But not what she came there for. And... But... Just to show what they were still thinking about women's wrestling at the time, they ended up doing, at WrestleMania 23, I want to say, they did... Santina. It was Santina Morella winning whatever women's brouhaha there was that night. So it was, again, just kind of reduced to comedy. Which is... You have Natty. And you have Beth Phoenix. And you can't come up with something. That's... It's a shame. It is. Yeah. Gail Kim was in that mix at one point. Gail Kim is fantastic, too. She was always really good and criminally underused, underutilized, misutilized. In WWE. Yeah. To TNA's credit. They had a stretch where they were doing better stuff with their women's division than WWE was doing with any of their roster. It was very compelling with her and Awesome Kong. They had a... They've got one of the best feuds of the last 10-12 years, I think. Yeah. At least for its time. WWE also had... Had Melina, who could do a few things in the ring. Michelle McCool was always really good. Didn't Melina and Michelle McCool get in trouble for having too good of a match? Yeah. That's the story. That they had a match at a pay-per-view where they were given seven or eight minutes. And they basically wrestled like they were guys. And had a really good match. It didn't particularly get over with the crowd because the crowd wasn't conditioned. To really expect anything good out of the women at that point. Because they hadn't been given the opportunity. So they, I guess, got crapped on backstage because of it after the fact. And then we go back to what we pretty much had for everything leading up to that point. So women's wrestling, I guess, for the longest time after that is still just kind of there. Natty ends up, for a while, not getting much opportunity. In the ring because she's running around with Great Khali. And then eventually gets lumped in. Not lumped in with Tyson Kidd and Cesaro. That ends up actually being a really nice trio. Yeah, I don't really count that. That was more of a... That made sense. And it was around the time that things were starting to turn for women's wrestling too. Because of NXT. Because of NXT. Which I asked the question earlier. Is women's wrestling becoming what women's wrestling is? Because all. Because Triple H has three female children. Is that it? Yeah, if Hunter had sired sons instead, would we be seeing Charlotte and Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks triple threat for the women's championship at WrestleMania 32 in front of 100,000 people? No, probably not. No, it's a very, very valid point. So that's very fair. He doesn't suddenly have three girls that he's looking at going, no, no, no, no, no. Women's wrestling is going to become a thing now. Because if they want to get into this business, they, no, they can't do that. So around the time that NXT kickstarts, the main roster looks something like this. You've got the Bellas who are still doing the twin magic stuff. Who are pretty horrible at that point. You've got AJ Lee who is with, whether she's with Daniel Bryan or John Cena or CM Punk or Kane. Yeah. She's kind of bouncing around from person to person. The adult, yeah. She's good in all those. I mean, she's good in everything she does. Sure. But. You've got like the one that was pregnant and hasn't been back. Rosa. Rosa Mendez. Rosa Mendez who, you know, whatever. And then. Oksana. Oksana was around. She was another one that. But they put her with Cesaro. Yeah. She was randomly with Cesaro and that didn't last very long. And then they had, I cannot think of her wrestling name. Her real name is Celeste. Oh. Caitlin. Caitlin. Caitlin. They had her in an angle where she farts. No, no. They did that to Natty. They did that to Natty. They did that to Natty. Oh, that hurts. So they did that thing and they did the Piggy James thing with Mickie James back in the day. And Caitlin was also considered a pig. I'm air quoting. Yeah. You can't see me. She had. I'm air quoting. She had what could potentially have been a decent feud with AJ Lee in the works and it became reduced to what she looked like. Yeah. And which is ridiculous because she's attractive. I don't understand. She's gorgeous. I don't get it. I don't get what the deal is there. Yeah. And for all the great things that they're doing with the women now, they still kind of do that kind of thing with Dana Brooke to a degree. Not nearly to the level that they do. They call her Miss Piggy. However, I don't, I don't think that that's actually a knock on like her weight or anything because Dana Brooke competes in these. Yeah. Muscle, these bodybuilding competitions. Right. It's, it's the blonde hair. It's, it's the actual. I guess, but I don't know. It's, they've just got such a history of. I think Miss Piggy is just getting a negative connotation here when Miss Piggy is fabulous. Well, she is. Have you seen the Muppet movies? She's the queen. She's the queen. Come on. But because of their history of how they talk about women, it makes sense that people would. It does. It does. Kind of be taken aback by that. Yeah. In the mix with those other ladies, you had the Funkadactyls. That's how Naomi got her start and she's in there with Cameron and Cameron of the Melina and Alicia Fox being the greatest women's match ever. Hit her on her stomach. Oh. You know, count it ref. Well, she's on her back. So she's, she, you know. Xavier Woods also got his start. Dancing with Brodus Clay. So. Yeah. And, and well more, I think it was more R-Truth than, but. Okay. Whichever. But it was along the same line. So there's not a lot. Oh, Tamina. Tamina's in that mix. And Tamina is another one who, I mean, she's, she has always kind of looked rough around the edges, but again, she's somebody that hasn't gotten a lot of opportunity to. Yeah. To wrestle consistently. So I've always wondered what she could do. If they'd give her more, more time. She's coming back from injury soon. So.
