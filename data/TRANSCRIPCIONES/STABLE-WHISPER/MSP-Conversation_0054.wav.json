{"text": " I'm April Baer. Our position today is just a few miles north of one of the most spectacular sites in Oregon. Land forced upon itself and then carved out by glaciers over millennia. People have lived here and prized this land for thousands of years. And every year, the full-time population of 7,000-odd residents is augmented by visitors. Among the farms and ranches, people come to hike and fish and hunt and swim. And they also come to read and to write. Wallowa County is also home to a singular gathering of writers called Fishtrap. Every summer, they converge to talk about writing and the West. And we find ourselves here right in the middle of 2015's Summer Fishtrap. We're going to kick off today's program with three people whose lives are bound up in the Fishtrap story. Rich Wanschneider has been living in Wallowa County since 1978. He has worked as a county extension agent, as a bookseller, and in the past as a director of Fishtrap for 20 years. Rich, welcome to State of Wonder. Thank you. Kim Stafford is with us as well. He's a poet, an educator who helped Rich and Alvin Giuseppe co-found Fishtrap in 1988. He's also the founding director of the Northwest Writing Institute. Kim, welcome and thank you for being here. Always good to be here, April. And Rose Kassler is a horse trainer who lives in Lostine. She took her first Fishtrap workshop at the tender age of 15 and now chairs the Fishtrap board. Rose Kassler, welcome to you as well. Thank you. Glad to be here. You became interested in the mid-1980s about this idea. Maybe what Oregon needed was a writing conference that was specific to the state. And you got this off the ground at Lewis and Clark College in Portland. Will you tell us about this guy who showed up at that first conference? Oh, yeah. You know, I work at a graduate school. I'm a scholar, all that. I've been to conferences. So I put the word out. We're going to have Writing in Oregon, a gathering. It was just an informal get-together for writers, readers, publishers, and so on. And one of the people who came was this big guy from Eastern Oregon, Rich Wanschneider. And he announced in a beautiful, gently belligerent way, you know, we're in Portland here. This is the I-5 Writers' Gathering. If you want to meet at the heart of the Northwest, that would be Wallowa County. And I called his bluff and said, let's do it. That was the conversation that led to the first Fishtrap. Yeah, we and many other helpers. Did you think when you stood up and said that that Kim would take you up on this? Well, I'd known him a little bit. See, I started the bookstore here in 76. I think that was the same year that Kim came as a poet in the schools. So Kim and I met then. And we had some relationship. And I guess we were young. Kim mentions the fact that in those days, we were young and everything was possible. So when he said that, it was an easy challenge. Sure, let's move it to the Wallowa. And so there we were. Did you agree with this initially, Kim? I mean, sure. I mean, the guy standing up and saying this, you can say, OK, Rich, whatever. But did you see the sense of it early on? I came here when I was 12 years old. And we camped up Losteen Canyon. And I wanted to get back. So it kind of worked out for me. That's beautiful. Rose Kessler, what were your early memories of having all these writers show up in town? Well, I was excited to get to be around them. And they were asking questions that I hadn't heard people ask. And they were inviting us. Such as? I think they were asking questions that urged me as a writer to write about who I really was and think about where I'd grown up in a kind of objective way. And having just grown up here and taking it all for granted and think it's totally normal to be out killing bears with your father and riding horses in the mountains and all those things, it made me realize, wait a second. This is a little different. And maybe I have something to say. And that really has led me into a lot of friendships. Interesting places in my life. Rich Wanschneider, Alvin Giuseppe would have been 100 years old this year. He was a journalist and editor, mid-century guy who saw through World War II and eventually got assigned a story out here and totally fell for the place. You worked with him on many projects over the years. But he was really best known as a chronicler of Native American life in America at that time. Why did Fishtrap matter to him? Something that he felt needed to be here. Well, I think we can go back to the first Fishtrap. So Kim challenges me. I get a hold of Alvin. Alvin says, that's a good idea. He said, you know, I've been going to these conferences in Sun Valley. And one of the things that bugs me is that the New York Times sends me the wrong books to read by the wrong authors about the West. Why don't we bring some Eastern publishers out and show them some West writers? And there we had the theme for the first Fishtrap. So it was important. Eastern publishers, Western writers. Eastern publishers, Western writers. And Alvin saw this as a place also to gather his friends, Bill Kittredge and Richard White. He, you know, that's what happened. What was the reaction of the publishers who you invited out here? Did they just sort of nod and smile? And who knows what they thought when they went back? Do you remember, Kim, who was that lady from the New Yorker magazine? Was it Naomi Blevins? Naomi Blevins. Yes, and she said, well, when I grew up in New York, mothers didn't cook, you know. We had cooks in our house. And there was another, there was an agent who said she'd flown into Pendleton and then drove here. And she lived her whole life in New York. And she said, I didn't realize clouds had shadows. So the disconnect between East and West was pretty big in a lot of cases. Did you feel at the time like Western writers just weren't taken that seriously? They weren't. Western writing was, I mean, Wallace Stegner said this. Wallace Stegner's books were not kept in print during his lifetime, you know. And people thought it was all Zane Gray. Western writing was a genre. Southern writing was national writing, but not Western writing. What do you have in mind for the people who are coming who are just starting to explore their own writing? What do they need to see among the Western writers that have come? They need to hear the tone of silence in the room when they tell a story or read a page, that there's a hunger for what they have. And then they become self-propelled to go the distance, as Rose has, to just follow their voice where it wants to go. Rose Kessler, to that point, you came as an aspiring young writer. What did you learn here? What I learned in Fishtrap that where I grew up was really special. And the voice that I had to offer was something different and that it was worth writing. And to not worry about all the things that I wasn't, but I guess to focus on what I was and what I did have to offer and have faith that people would sort of find that interesting. You went on to college at Lewis and Clark. I did, thanks to Kim. I went and I ended up working in his office in a working student position. How did your life here and your orientation to your writing, how did that color your interactions with the people that you met? Well, I think there was, it was at first kind of a cultural exchange. I think there was a lot of, Lewis and Clark is a really diverse and international school and kids come from all over the U.S. and the world to study there. And I think I was probably a little sheltered at that time. I hadn't been a lot of places. And one thing that I remember is that the summer before I went to college, I shot a four-point buck and I was really proud of that, like four points. It's, it's nice size, you know, and it was delicious. It fed my family. And so my dad and I made it into a European mount, which is where you have the skull and the antlers attached to one another and the bone is all clean and white. And I think it's very beautiful. So I took that with me to school and I hung it on the wall and immediately I was known as the girl with the shrine to death in her dorm room. And I was just totally perplexed at that time, like that they didn't recognize that this was like, this was a prize and that it was really an accomplishment. Where did your writing take you over the years? Well, it's, it's gotten me a lot of jobs because people love that I can make a complete sentence and edit things properly. And it's also made me a lot of friends. And most recently it helped me with an internship in classical dressage in Pennsylvania. You know, we had to write essays in order to apply for the position. And I was also attracted to that particular internship because the trainer is also an author. And so we had a lot of in common through the written word that way. And I ended up helping him edit his most recent novel. Rich Wonschneider, the story of the Nez Perce is totally interwoven with the story of this place. And despite the fact that a lot of Nez Perce people have never been able to return, are there ways in which that story informs what happens at Fishtrap? We've tried many times to have some kind of Nez Perce presence here. We've gone so far as to have Nez Perce language classes, which Kim took one time from Horace Axtell. I think though, there's a deep sore in this place. The people who live here know that this was taken away from Indians. This was one of the last Indian wars. The taking was relatively recent. The people who used to live here, there were probably only a couple hundred Nez Perce who lived here. At the time that they left, a couple hundred white people, and they were kind of trying to get along. But they had big factors out there. They had civil wars and gold rushes and all this stuff that made it impossible for the Nez Perce to stay here. But they haven't forgotten it. And I remember one time a Nez Perce woman was down at our Nez Perce Homeland Project in Malawi. She had never been here. When she came into this valley, she started crying immediately. She remembered stories that had been passed down, passed down, passed down. And I think that there's a healing in places like Fishtrap and having writers come here. Who was it that said every piece of writing is about loss? Indians have a loss that nobody else had in this country. Joseph, he said that all the time. And so there's a disconnect that still goes on. And I think that we get to address that here. So we're privileged to do it. Your summer Fishtrap is hidden from history. Stories we haven't heard, stories we haven't told. Rich, I know that you did not choose this theme. You passed the torch on for Fishtrap some time ago. But I was curious for your interpretation. In towns like Enterprise and Joseph and Wallowa and Lostine, people know each other. What do you get when you ask people to think about their hidden truths? Here? Locally? What do we get? Oh, man. You get some stories. People are listening. And who's listening? And how many beers you've had? Where you are. If you're at the Lostine Tavern, you might get something. I mean, we go to the post office with loggers and ex-wives. We have to get along. We come to accommodations and we tell our stories back and forth. And they kind of help us knit a community together. Fishtrap is one story here now. And now this place is becoming a story. And all of these things become woe. And it's been woven into the fabric of the community. Kim Stafford, is there anything, any hidden histories that Fishtrap has uncovered over the years? Yeah, you know, I was at Fishtrap one time. And I was being overwhelmed by the memories of the death of my brother. And I left the conference and I hiked up the canyon. And I came just at dusk up into a meadow. And the butterflies were all coming out. It was so beautiful. And this line went through my mind. I am feeding my brother. This beautiful world. And that was really the moment I was able to start writing a book about my brother. So it wasn't so much that you learn to write at Fishtrap, although that does happen. But you learn the power you will need. And that you are not alone in the process. Kim Stafford, Rich Wanschneider, and Rose Kessler, I want to thank you all very much for being with us today. And thanks for sharing Fishtrap with us over all these years. Thank you. Thank you, April. Thank you. Thank you. He was so great. This building we're sitting in, a hub of arts and culture, was named after him. We're joined now by the Giuseppe Center's director, Cheryl Coughlin. Cheryl, welcome. Thank you, April. Thanks for being here. Well, thank you for having us. What do you feel like you have to do to nurture the cultural life of a community like this? I think our goal is always to parallel what's going on in our community. And that is what's going to draw people in. So we have a series of exhibits that have an artistic theme to it. And then we try to line out programs, lectures, readings, everything that also encompass that subject. And when we do that, we bring in multiple different types of people. So we had a show about horses. So we brought in ranchers. We brought in artists that were interested in horses. We brought in writers who love to write about horses. And that person that came for a brown bag wasn't necessarily someone attracted to artwork. But there they were exposed to it. And we had artists doing workshops that were doing preliminary clay pieces to make bronzes. And they had never even done it. But they had a love for horses. And so they just wanted to take this workshop. So we're just trying to give people the opportunity to experience different things here. And just the fact that it's a small town is just icing on the cake.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.76, "text": " I'm April Baer.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [286, 478, 6929, 6777, 260, 13],

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " I'm April Baer. Our position today is just a few miles north of one of the most spectacular sites in Oregon. Land forced upon itself and then carved out by glaciers over millennia. People have lived here and prized this land for thousands of years. And every year, the full-time population of 7,000-odd residents is augmented by visitors. Among the farms and ranches, people come to hike and fish and hunt and swim. And they also come to read and to write. Wallowa County is also home to a singular gathering of writers called Fishtrap. Every summer, they converge to talk about writing and the West. And we find ourselves here right in the middle of 2015's Summer Fishtrap. We're going to kick off today's program with three people whose lives are bound up in the Fishtrap story. Rich Wanschneider has been living in Wallowa County since 1978. He has worked as a county extension agent, as a bookseller, and in the past as a director of Fishtrap for 20 years. Rich, welcome to State of Wonder. Thank you. Kim Stafford is with us as well. He's a poet, an educator who helped Rich and Alvin Giuseppe co-found Fishtrap in 1988. He's also the founding director of the Northwest Writing Institute. Kim, welcome and thank you for being here. Always good to be here, April. And Rose Kassler is a horse trainer who lives in Lostine. She took her first Fishtrap workshop at the tender age of 15 and now chairs the Fishtrap board. Rose Kassler, welcome to you as well. Thank you. Glad to be here. You became interested in the mid-1980s about this idea. Maybe what Oregon needed was a writing conference that was specific to the state. And you got this off the ground at Lewis and Clark College in Portland. Will you tell us about this guy who showed up at that first conference? Oh, yeah. You know, I work at a graduate school. I'm a scholar, all that. I've been to conferences. So I put the word out. We're going to have Writing in Oregon, a gathering. It was just an informal get-together for writers, readers, publishers, and so on. And one of the people who came was this big guy from Eastern Oregon, Rich Wanschneider. And he announced in a beautiful, gently belligerent way, you know, we're in Portland here. This is the I-5 Writers' Gathering. If you want to meet at the heart of the Northwest, that would be Wallowa County. And I called his bluff and said, let's do it. That was the conversation that led to the first Fishtrap. Yeah, we and many other helpers. Did you think when you stood up and said that that Kim would take you up on this? Well, I'd known him a little bit. See, I started the bookstore here in 76. I think that was the same year that Kim came as a poet in the schools. So Kim and I met then. And we had some relationship. And I guess we were young. Kim mentions the fact that in those days, we were young and everything was possible. So when he said that, it was an easy challenge. Sure, let's move it to the Wallowa. And so there we were. Did you agree with this initially, Kim? I mean, sure. I mean, the guy standing up and saying this, you can say, OK, Rich, whatever. But did you see the sense of it early on? I came here when I was 12 years old. And we camped up Losteen Canyon. And I wanted to get back. So it kind of worked out for me. That's beautiful. Rose Kessler, what were your early memories of having all these writers show up in town? Well, I was excited to get to be around them. And they were asking questions that I hadn't heard people ask. And they were inviting us. Such as? I think they were asking questions that urged me as a writer to write about who I really was and think about where I'd grown up in a kind of objective way. And having just grown up here and taking it all for granted and think it's totally normal to be out killing bears with your father and riding horses in the mountains and all those things, it made me realize, wait a second. This is a little different. And maybe I have something to say. And that really has led me into a lot of friendships. Interesting places in my life. Rich Wanschneider, Alvin Giuseppe would have been 100 years old this year. He was a journalist and editor, mid-century guy who saw through World War II and eventually got assigned a story out here and totally fell for the place. You worked with him on many projects over the years. But he was really best known as a chronicler of Native American life in America at that time. Why did Fishtrap matter to him? Something that he felt needed to be here. Well, I think we can go back to the first Fishtrap. So Kim challenges me. I get a hold of Alvin. Alvin says, that's a good idea. He said, you know, I've been going to these conferences in Sun Valley. And one of the things that bugs me is that the New York Times sends me the wrong books to read by the wrong authors about the West. Why don't we bring some Eastern publishers out and show them some West writers? And there we had the theme for the first Fishtrap. So it was important. Eastern publishers, Western writers. Eastern publishers, Western writers. And Alvin saw this as a place also to gather his friends, Bill Kittredge and Richard White. He, you know, that's what happened. What was the reaction of the publishers who you invited out here? Did they just sort of nod and smile? And who knows what they thought when they went back? Do you remember, Kim, who was that lady from the New Yorker magazine? Was it Naomi Blevins? Naomi Blevins. Yes, and she said, well, when I grew up in New York, mothers didn't cook, you know. We had cooks in our house. And there was another, there was an agent who said she'd flown into Pendleton and then drove here. And she lived her whole life in New York. And she said, I didn't realize clouds had shadows. So the disconnect between East and West was pretty big in a lot of cases. Did you feel at the time like Western writers just weren't taken that seriously? They weren't. Western writing was, I mean, Wallace Stegner said this. Wallace Stegner's books were not kept in print during his lifetime, you know. And people thought it was all Zane Gray. Western writing was a genre. Southern writing was national writing, but not Western writing. What do you have in mind for the people who are coming who are just starting to explore their own writing? What do they need to see among the Western writers that have come? They need to hear the tone of silence in the room when they tell a story or read a page, that there's a hunger for what they have. And then they become self-propelled to go the distance, as Rose has, to just follow their voice where it wants to go. Rose Kessler, to that point, you came as an aspiring young writer. What did you learn here? What I learned in Fishtrap that where I grew up was really special. And the voice that I had to offer was something different and that it was worth writing. And to not worry about all the things that I wasn't, but I guess to focus on what I was and what I did have to offer and have faith that people would sort of find that interesting. You went on to college at Lewis and Clark. I did, thanks to Kim. I went and I ended up working in his office in a working student position. How did your life here and your orientation to your writing, how did that color your interactions with the people that you met? Well, I think there was, it was at first kind of a cultural exchange. I think there was a lot of, Lewis and Clark is a really diverse and international school and kids come from all over the U.S. and the world to study there. And I think I was probably a little sheltered at that time. I hadn't been a lot of places. And one thing that I remember is that the summer before I went to college, I shot a four-point buck and I was really proud of that, like four points. It's, it's nice size, you know, and it was delicious. It fed my family. And so my dad and I made it into a European mount, which is where you have the skull and the antlers attached to one another and the bone is all clean and white. And I think it's very beautiful. So I took that with me to school and I hung it on the wall and immediately I was known as the girl with the shrine to death in her dorm room. And I was just totally perplexed at that time, like that they didn't recognize that this was like, this was a prize and that it was really an accomplishment. Where did your writing take you over the years? Well, it's, it's gotten me a lot of jobs because people love that I can make a complete sentence and edit things properly. And it's also made me a lot of friends. And most recently it helped me with an internship in classical dressage in Pennsylvania. You know, we had to write essays in order to apply for the position. And I was also attracted to that particular internship because the trainer is also an author. And so we had a lot of in common through the written word that way. And I ended up helping him edit his most recent novel. Rich Wonschneider, the story of the Nez Perce is totally interwoven with the story of this place. And despite the fact that a lot of Nez Perce people have never been able to return, are there ways in which that story informs what happens at Fishtrap? We've tried many times to have some kind of Nez Perce presence here. We've gone so far as to have Nez Perce language classes, which Kim took one time from Horace Axtell. I think though, there's a deep sore in this place. The people who live here know that this was taken away from Indians. This was one of the last Indian wars. The taking was relatively recent. The people who used to live here, there were probably only a couple hundred Nez Perce who lived here. At the time that they left, a couple hundred white people, and they were kind of trying to get along. But they had big factors out there. They had civil wars and gold rushes and all this stuff that made it impossible for the Nez Perce to stay here. But they haven't forgotten it. And I remember one time a Nez Perce woman was down at our Nez Perce Homeland Project in Malawi. She had never been here. When she came into this valley, she started crying immediately. She remembered stories that had been passed down, passed down, passed down. And I think that there's a healing in places like Fishtrap and having writers come here. Who was it that said every piece of writing is about loss? Indians have a loss that nobody else had in this country. Joseph, he said that all the time. And so there's a disconnect that still goes on. And I think that we get to address that here. So we're privileged to do it. Your summer Fishtrap is hidden from history. Stories we haven't heard, stories we haven't told. Rich, I know that you did not choose this theme. You passed the torch on for Fishtrap some time ago. But I was curious for your interpretation. In towns like Enterprise and Joseph and Wallowa and Lostine, people know each other. What do you get when you ask people to think about their hidden truths? Here? Locally? What do we get? Oh, man. You get some stories. People are listening. And who's listening? And how many beers you've had? Where you are. If you're at the Lostine Tavern, you might get something. I mean, we go to the post office with loggers and ex-wives. We have to get along. We come to accommodations and we tell our stories back and forth. And they kind of help us knit a community together. Fishtrap is one story here now. And now this place is becoming a story. And all of these things become woe. And it's been woven into the fabric of the community. Kim Stafford, is there anything, any hidden histories that Fishtrap has uncovered over the years? Yeah, you know, I was at Fishtrap one time. And I was being overwhelmed by the memories of the death of my brother. And I left the conference and I hiked up the canyon. And I came just at dusk up into a meadow. And the butterflies were all coming out. It was so beautiful. And this line went through my mind. I am feeding my brother. This beautiful world. And that was really the moment I was able to start writing a book about my brother. So it wasn't so much that you learn to write at Fishtrap, although that does happen. But you learn the power you will need. And that you are not alone in the process. Kim Stafford, Rich Wanschneider, and Rose Kessler, I want to thank you all very much for being with us today. And thanks for sharing Fishtrap with us over all these years. Thank you. Thank you, April. Thank you. Thank you. He was so great. This building we're sitting in, a hub of arts and culture, was named after him. We're joined now by the Giuseppe Center's director, Cheryl Coughlin. Cheryl, welcome. Thank you, April. Thanks for being here. Well, thank you for having us. What do you feel like you have to do to nurture the cultural life of a community like this? I think our goal is always to parallel what's going on in our community. And that is what's going to draw people in. So we have a series of exhibits that have an artistic theme to it. And then we try to line out programs, lectures, readings, everything that also encompass that subject. And when we do that, we bring in multiple different types of people. So we had a show about horses. So we brought in ranchers. We brought in artists that were interested in horses. We brought in writers who love to write about horses. And that person that came for a brown bag wasn't necessarily someone attracted to artwork. But there they were exposed to it. And we had artists doing workshops that were doing preliminary clay pieces to make bronzes. And they had never even done it. But they had a love for horses. And so they just wanted to take this workshop. So we're just trying to give people the opportunity to experience different things here. And just the fact that it's a small town is just icing on the cake.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.04, "text": " I'm April Baer.
