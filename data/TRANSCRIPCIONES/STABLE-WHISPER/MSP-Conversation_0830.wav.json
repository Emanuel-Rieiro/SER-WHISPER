{"text": " the majority of mass shooters in this country was a white American. And that simple fact changes absolutely everything about the way this horrible moment gets discussed in the media and the national discourse. Whiteness somehow protects men from being labeled terrorists. Unless, of course, you're Timothy McVeigh. Oh wait, that's not in the article. Okay, the privilege here is that the ultimate conclusion about shootings committed by people from commonly non-white groups often leads to determinations about the coercive or destructive nature of the group itself. When an individual claiming to be Muslim commits a horrible act, many on the right will tell us Islam is the problem. For centuries, when an act of violence has been committed by an African American, racist tropes follow, and eventually the criminalization and dehumanization of an entire ethnic group. So, that's why I'm going to stop and say that, Justin, should we now just demonize all white people because this white douchebag shot and killed 58 people in Las Vegas? Wait, we don't already demonize all white people? Thank you! Your question really elicited the answer you wanted out of me. So, I mean, I have a couple of things to say about this whole argument. And I think this is an important thing to talk about. And James, maybe you can answer this. I think this might be better for you to answer than for me. But the first thing I want to do is I want to ask Daniel a question. Daniel, wasn't the DC sniper years ago black? Yes. Did we go around saying like that was an example of black people being terrorists and evil when he did that? No, of course not. And that's one of the things that's completely disingenuous about this paragraph. One is he gives two examples of us demonizing quote unquote groups based on their crimes. But the second example, he says for centuries, again, meaning not in modern American history, when an act of violence has been committed by an African American, racist tropes follow. I think that's complete non sequitur. We don't demonize all African Americans when crimes are done. We don't demonize all Muslims when acts are committed. It's, by the way, what we're talking about is people who commit violence in the name of radical or not even radical, just in the name of Islam. That's what we're talking about. Right. And that is the thing I want to toss to James here, because there's an irony of this article. And the irony is he's complaining about collectivism while using collectivism himself. Right. He's saying, you guys see everyone else collectivist. So we're going to see white people collectivist. So this is the question I want to ask James and Daniel. You can chime in, too. But well, I just think you might have more knowledge about this. But what is the difference between the collectivism we rail against and railing against Islam leading to terrorism? What is the difference between those two things? Because I think that's a very important point to make, because I think he's intentionally obscuring those to make them seem the same. Right. Yeah. Good question. I mean, so, yeah, there's racial collectivism and then there's just judging people based on their ideas and thinking that actions have relevancy for judging certain ideas. So, you know, if we were to look at this guy and say that this guy's actions are somehow reflective of white people, that would be racial collectivism, because clearly, you know, it's not the whiteness of his skin that caused him to do this, just as the blackness of the D.C. sniper had nothing to do with his, you know, his actions. However, you know, the opposite of collectivism, which is judging people based on the ideas they hold, is what you see if maybe you judge a Muslim person for committing a terrorist action. And now you say, OK, well, you know, this was done in the name of Islam. This is we now have an ideology we can latch on to to try and understand this violence or or even, you know, there's there's a certain ideology within the criminal populations of black cultures that tends towards violence. That's something that can be studied and has nothing to do with their skin color or their, you know, general racial makeup. It's just it's a particular ideology that leads to violence. And so that can be understood and to understand it is the opposite of racial collectivism because you're judging people based on their ideas, regardless of their race. So and of course, the left has every intention of blurring this important distinction so that we basically this is saying, like, whenever you try to make generalizations about anyone ever at all, you're a bigot. That's basically except when you do it to white people, of course, that's that's basically the implicit. Yeah, statement here. Absolutely. It's it's one of these things that that pisses me off every time these things come up where it's like, if if some white guy did it in the name of Islam, and explicitly said in the name of Islam, I would judge him the same way as any brown guy who did. An act of violence in the name of Islam, like, and that was never in question, right? That people thought he may have been Muslim in the first few hours. Oh, fuck. Like, maybe this guy converted is because ISIS even claimed that he did. And he apparently visited the Middle East, although, you know, that proves nothing at the moment. Right? So it's this whole lone wolf thing this day, they're blowing this out of proportion in order to basically, you know, demonize our attempt to generalize based on ideas. And that, to me, is super dangerous. One of the other things here is that I've noticed lately that the left and the right try to jump to claim that something is terrorism. And then the other side tries to claim it's not terrorism. So we're getting to this point where the word terrorism doesn't mean anything anymore. Yeah. It's like, because basically, no matter what happens, the one side tries to say, well, terrorism is basically any act of violence that induces terror. It's like, well, that's a stupid definition. That's not even a good reason to have a word. I would say that if we're going to talk about what terrorism is and isn't, there has to be a political component, right? Isn't it the idea to cause mass fear to gain a political end of some sort? Isn't that the whole concept behind terrorism? Yeah, it's a military tactic. Yeah. So, yeah, this guy could be a terrorist if he had some political aim that he was trying to pursue. But wouldn't he have made it a little more obvious if that was the case? Yeah, it was a terrorism fail. If so, worst terrorist ever. What does that say about white people? What does that say about all white people? I mean, terror. What's kind of funny is, is you can't have a conversation about what the word like about their this person's use of the word terrorism without holding in mind what terrorism is really was supposed to mean. It basically terrorism, you know, after George W. Bush, terrorism has basically come to mean like violence perpetrated in the name of Islam, except we don't want to admit that it's Islam. That's basically what terrorism means. And so like by calling him a terrorist, you're destroying a word that already had a nebulous meaning. But it had a real meaning to most people. Like when you say terrorism, everyone knows like, okay, it was a Muslim. Yes. Like, it's just unspoken. Like, okay, I know what that means. Yes. Which is kind of silly because someone like Timothy McVeigh, you would you would call that terrorism, right? It's just a different ideology. Yes. Like his tactic was that of terror. And he had a political aim. You know, they don't have a monopoly on that military tactic. You know, like, if you're white, you don't have to be like a Cuban, you know, communist revolutionary to engage in guerrilla warfare. You can also do it if you're white. It's a multicultural, you could do if you're Chinese. We all, we all do it. It's my favorite thing to do in Airsoft. So, you know. Yes. You know, don't exclude me. So here's, here's the paragraph that I hated the most out of this article. And Justin, I'll let you rage against this paragraph in a moment. It's this. Quote, what we are witnessing. First of all, don't take our word, guy. Okay. What we are witnessing is the blatant fact that white privilege protects even douchebag and alleged mass murderer, not just from being called a terrorist, but from the anger, rage, hellfire, and fury that would surely rain down if he were almost any other than a white man. His skin protects him. It also prevents our nation from having an honest conversation about why so many white men do what he did and why this nation seems absolutely determined to do, do next to nothing about it. What the actual fuck are you talking about? I like it how she just slipped that one in just like, oh yeah. And so many white men. Right. And that's the most, most disturbing thing is like, can somebody tell me all the, the so many, like what does so many mean when we're talking concretely in reality? What does so many mean? Are there any statistics to back up anything close to what he's saying? I mean, is he just referring to Dylan roof and he's referring to the guy who shot people during what was it? The dark night rises. And now this, is that what he's saying? So three, is that what he's saying? Three people? Yeah. I mean, they're, they're what, what's the true part of what he's saying is that these mass shootings tend to be white people, but these, the first of all, we, as we've said on many weeks before, white people means nothing because it doesn't refer to an actual collection of human beings. It's, it's basically not helpful because not all white people are the same. It turns out racists. And then two, who cares what race these people, the race of these people doesn't tell us anything about their motives. Doesn't tell us anything about who they are. Doesn't tell us anything about anything. I mean, their ideas and their affiliations are way more important. Right. I mean, and that, that's where I want to take this conversation. I'll get there in a second, but I just want to make the point that it's not even true. What were the two deadliest before this Virginia tech and pulse? Uh, I don't know. I'll tell my head, but they, they are among the deadliest. Certainly. Okay. Well, we'll just say Virginia tech was an Asian. Well, that's exactly what I was just going to say. So we'll say the three biggest and don't get mad at me out there. If they're not the three biggest, but these are the three biggest that I remember. So we'll say that maybe it's just because my brother was at Virginia tech at the time. And then Elliot is a gay guy in Orlando. Just the connections to them. But Virginia tech, Asian pulse in Orlando. Wasn't he Persian? Was he Iranian? What was he? He was Middle Eastern, right? He was Saudi. Okay. But he was Middle Eastern. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Um, I don't know, but he was, he was not white. He was not white and he was not black. Right. Sean King, the writer of this article is a race baiting black man, but this guy, God, and he killed 49 people. I forgot how many people died in Orlando. That's unbelievable. But the point is he was not white. So we have Asian Middle Eastern. You got it right. What? Persian? Yeah. Oh no. He was Middle Eastern of some kind, but number three is Virginia tech. You, you got them right in there. Okay. Well, I'm glad I know the statistic. This makes me feel real good about my life and our culture that I, I know what the top three deadliest mass shootings in modern us history. That's, that's, that's great knowledge to have in my life. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So Virginia tech, Asian, pulse, Middle Eastern, Las Vegas, white guy. So all we've learned is if we're given the white people as a group credit for things is just like Hitler. We're just really efficient at mass killing. We're not the only ones who do it, but no, the point is it, this isn't even true from a cross section, right? Everyone is doing this, right?

{"text": " the majority of mass shooters in this country was a white American. And that simple fact changes absolutely everything about the way this horrible moment gets discussed in the media and the national discourse. Whiteness somehow protects men from being labeled terrorists. Unless, of course, you're Timothy McVeigh. Oh wait, that's not in the article. Okay, the privilege here is that the ultimate conclusion about shootings committed by people from commonly non-white groups often leads to determinations about the coercive or destructive nature of the group itself. When an individual claiming to be Muslim commits a horrible act, many on the right will tell us Islam is the problem. For centuries, when an act of violence has been committed by an African American, racist tropes follow, and eventually the criminalization and dehumanization of an entire ethnic group. So, that's why I'm going to stop and say that, Justin, should we now just demonize all white people because this white douchebag shot and killed 58 people in Las Vegas? Wait, we don't already demonize all white people? Thank you! Your question really elicited the answer you wanted out of me. So, I mean, I have a couple of things to say about this whole argument. And I think this is an important thing to talk about. And James, maybe you can answer this. I think this might be better for you to answer than for me. But the first thing I want to do is I want to ask Daniel a question. Daniel, wasn't the DC sniper years ago black? Yes. Did we go around saying like that was an example of black people being terrorists and evil when he did that? No, of course not. And that's one of the things that's completely disingenuous about this paragraph. One is he gives two examples of us demonizing quote unquote groups based on their crimes. But the second example, he says for centuries, again, meaning not in modern American history, when an act of violence has been committed by an African American, racist tropes follow. I think that's complete non sequitur. We don't demonize all African Americans when crimes are done. We don't demonize all Muslims when acts are committed. It's, by the way, what we're talking about is people who commit violence in the name of radical or not even radical, just in the name of Islam. That's what we're talking about. Right. And that is the thing I want to toss to James here, because there's an irony of this article. And the irony is he's complaining about collectivism while using collectivism himself. Right. He's saying, you guys see everyone else collectivist. So we're going to see white people collectivist. So this is the question I want to ask James and Daniel. You can chime in, too. But well, I just think you might have more knowledge about this. But what is the difference between the collectivism we rail against and railing against Islam leading to terrorism? What is the difference between those two things? Because I think that's a very important point to make, because I think he's intentionally obscuring those to make them seem the same. Right. Yeah. Good question. I mean, so, yeah, there's racial collectivism and then there's just judging people based on their ideas and thinking that actions have relevancy for judging certain ideas. So, you know, if we were to look at this guy and say that this guy's actions are somehow reflective of white people, that would be racial collectivism, because clearly, you know, it's not the whiteness of his skin that caused him to do this, just as the blackness of the D.C. sniper had nothing to do with his, you know, his actions. However, you know, the opposite of collectivism, which is judging people based on the ideas they hold, is what you see if maybe you judge a Muslim person for committing a terrorist action. And now you say, OK, well, you know, this was done in the name of Islam. This is we now have an ideology we can latch on to to try and understand this violence or or even, you know, there's there's a certain ideology within the criminal populations of black cultures that tends towards violence. That's something that can be studied and has nothing to do with their skin color or their, you know, general racial makeup. It's just it's a particular ideology that leads to violence. And so that can be understood and to understand it is the opposite of racial collectivism because you're judging people based on their ideas, regardless of their race. So and of course, the left has every intention of blurring this important distinction so that we basically this is saying, like, whenever you try to make generalizations about anyone ever at all, you're a bigot. That's basically except when you do it to white people, of course, that's that's basically the implicit. Yeah, statement here. Absolutely. It's it's one of these things that that pisses me off every time these things come up where it's like, if if some white guy did it in the name of Islam, and explicitly said in the name of Islam, I would judge him the same way as any brown guy who did. An act of violence in the name of Islam, like, and that was never in question, right? That people thought he may have been Muslim in the first few hours. Oh, fuck. Like, maybe this guy converted is because ISIS even claimed that he did. And he apparently visited the Middle East, although, you know, that proves nothing at the moment. Right? So it's this whole lone wolf thing this day, they're blowing this out of proportion in order to basically, you know, demonize our attempt to generalize based on ideas. And that, to me, is super dangerous. One of the other things here is that I've noticed lately that the left and the right try to jump to claim that something is terrorism. And then the other side tries to claim it's not terrorism. So we're getting to this point where the word terrorism doesn't mean anything anymore. Yeah. It's like, because basically, no matter what happens, the one side tries to say, well, terrorism is basically any act of violence that induces terror. It's like, well, that's a stupid definition. That's not even a good reason to have a word. I would say that if we're going to talk about what terrorism is and isn't, there has to be a political component, right? Isn't it the idea to cause mass fear to gain a political end of some sort? Isn't that the whole concept behind terrorism? Yeah, it's a military tactic. Yeah. So, yeah, this guy could be a terrorist if he had some political aim that he was trying to pursue. But wouldn't he have made it a little more obvious if that was the case? Yeah, it was a terrorism fail. If so, worst terrorist ever. What does that say about white people? What does that say about all white people? I mean, terror. What's kind of funny is, is you can't have a conversation about what the word like about their this person's use of the word terrorism without holding in mind what terrorism is really was supposed to mean. It basically terrorism, you know, after George W. Bush, terrorism has basically come to mean like violence perpetrated in the name of Islam, except we don't want to admit that it's Islam. That's basically what terrorism means. And so like by calling him a terrorist, you're destroying a word that already had a nebulous meaning. But it had a real meaning to most people. Like when you say terrorism, everyone knows like, okay, it was a Muslim. Yes. Like, it's just unspoken. Like, okay, I know what that means. Yes. Which is kind of silly because someone like Timothy McVeigh, you would you would call that terrorism, right? It's just a different ideology. Yes. Like his tactic was that of terror. And he had a political aim. You know, they don't have a monopoly on that military tactic. You know, like, if you're white, you don't have to be like a Cuban, you know, communist revolutionary to engage in guerrilla warfare. You can also do it if you're white. It's a multicultural, you could do if you're Chinese. We all, we all do it. It's my favorite thing to do in Airsoft. So, you know. Yes. You know, don't exclude me. So here's, here's the paragraph that I hated the most out of this article. And Justin, I'll let you rage against this paragraph in a moment. It's this. Quote, what we are witnessing. First of all, don't take our word, guy. Okay. What we are witnessing is the blatant fact that white privilege protects even douchebag and alleged mass murderer, not just from being called a terrorist, but from the anger, rage, hellfire, and fury that would surely rain down if he were almost any other than a white man. His skin protects him. It also prevents our nation from having an honest conversation about why so many white men do what he did and why this nation seems absolutely determined to do, do next to nothing about it. What the actual fuck are you talking about? I like it how she just slipped that one in just like, oh yeah. And so many white men. Right. And that's the most, most disturbing thing is like, can somebody tell me all the, the so many, like what does so many mean when we're talking concretely in reality? What does so many mean? Are there any statistics to back up anything close to what he's saying? I mean, is he just referring to Dylan roof and he's referring to the guy who shot people during what was it? The dark night rises. And now this, is that what he's saying? So three, is that what he's saying? Three people? Yeah. I mean, they're, they're what, what's the true part of what he's saying is that these mass shootings tend to be white people, but these, the first of all, we, as we've said on many weeks before, white people means nothing because it doesn't refer to an actual collection of human beings. It's, it's basically not helpful because not all white people are the same. It turns out racists. And then two, who cares what race these people, the race of these people doesn't tell us anything about their motives. Doesn't tell us anything about who they are. Doesn't tell us anything about anything. I mean, their ideas and their affiliations are way more important. Right. I mean, and that, that's where I want to take this conversation. I'll get there in a second, but I just want to make the point that it's not even true. What were the two deadliest before this Virginia tech and pulse? Uh, I don't know. I'll tell my head, but they, they are among the deadliest. Certainly. Okay. Well, we'll just say Virginia tech was an Asian. Well, that's exactly what I was just going to say. So we'll say the three biggest and don't get mad at me out there. If they're not the three biggest, but these are the three biggest that I remember. So we'll say that maybe it's just because my brother was at Virginia tech at the time. And then Elliot is a gay guy in Orlando. Just the connections to them. But Virginia tech, Asian pulse in Orlando. Wasn't he Persian? Was he Iranian? What was he? He was Middle Eastern, right? He was Saudi. Okay. But he was Middle Eastern. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Um, I don't know, but he was, he was not white. He was not white and he was not black. Right. Sean King, the writer of this article is a race baiting black man, but this guy, God, and he killed 49 people. I forgot how many people died in Orlando. That's unbelievable. But the point is he was not white. So we have Asian Middle Eastern. You got it right. What? Persian? Yeah. Oh no. He was Middle Eastern of some kind, but number three is Virginia tech. You, you got them right in there. Okay. Well, I'm glad I know the statistic. This makes me feel real good about my life and our culture that I, I know what the top three deadliest mass shootings in modern us history. That's, that's, that's great knowledge to have in my life. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So Virginia tech, Asian, pulse, Middle Eastern, Las Vegas, white guy. So all we've learned is if we're given the white people as a group credit for things is just like Hitler. We're just really efficient at mass killing. We're not the only ones who do it, but no, the point is it, this isn't even true from a cross section, right? Everyone is doing this, right?
