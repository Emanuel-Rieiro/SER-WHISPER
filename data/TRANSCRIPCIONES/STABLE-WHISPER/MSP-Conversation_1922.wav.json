{"text": " I think in some ways this could be a bad sign of things to come, a negative sign of things to come, where essentially U.S. presidential politics turns into just a sort of popularity contest. A reality TV series from New Hampshire and Iowa all the way through the general election, something like that? Exactly. Like who's in the public sphere? Who's in the public eye who most encapsules people's frustrations and what's most important to them at the moment? Because that certainly seems to be the wave that Donald Trump rode all the way into the White House. So let's talk about Oprah's positives right off the bat. She starts out with almost instant universal name recognition. There's almost no one in America who doesn't know who Oprah Winfrey was. And she starts out with, I'm not sure what her net worth is, but I believe it's over a billion. I think she's low single-digit billions. So she could entirely self-fund her campaign. She doesn't have to worry about fundraising. Yeah, in many ways she has the same advantages that Trump was able to exploit. Exactly. Only she has the further advantage that he's already written the blueprint that she just has to follow. Obviously different ideology, but the same sort of bombastic enough is enough, we've had enough of this. And we know that it's not all right-wing because a lot of the people that actually voted for Donald Trump were the same people that voted for Barack Obama. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And in a strange way, Barack Obama is a sort of blueprint, the sort of prototype even for someone like Oprah Winfrey or Donald Trump, even though he was obviously a politician, but in some ways an outsider, in some ways an underdog. And against Hillary, curiously, Oprah Winfrey supported Barack Obama and not Hillary Clinton, which in a strange twist of events could end up being advantageous to her in the future. And then in 2016, of course, she endorsed Hillary Clinton. What we've seen recently in the Democratic Party is a real divide between a kind of more mainstream DNC-type faction that backed first Bill Clinton and now Hillary Clinton and the Bernie Sanders wing. And Bernie has some close allies, people like, say, Elizabeth Warren or Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio. How would Oprah fit into the Democratic Party? Would she be more, I don't think of her as some real left-wing activist type. No, I don't. I don't really know what her political views are, to be perfectly honest. I mean, I know she's a Democrat, but where would she fit into a Democratic primary? That's a great question. And if it weren't, again, if it weren't for Trump, I would probably just dismiss the prospect of an Oprah presidency outright. But you said it yourself, you don't know what her platform would be. I still don't know what Donald Trump's platform is entirely, to be honest. And he's constantly hiring, firing, disputing, feuding with people that are supposedly on his side, people that helped him get elected. It does get a little tiresome after a while. Indeed. It's just like a revolving door at the Trump White House. And I think with Winfrey, we could see something similar on the DNC side, with her not really coming from a political background, so not necessarily having core beliefs. I don't believe Trump has core beliefs. You could argue that either way. But I don't believe Trump has core beliefs, and I think it's unlikely Winfrey does either. She'd just rely on her cabinet, which could be as subject to change as Trump's is now. So the people that are consistently batted about right now in a Democratic primary, you of course have Bernie Sanders, who seems to be the frontrunner right now, even though I still don't think he can win a Democratic nomination. I suspect that he's a shill with no intention to win from the beginning. He might have been a plant to lose to Hillary from the onset. And he's not even a Democrat. That's the funniest thing of all. He is not now, nor has never been a Democrat in any way, shape, or form. When he was back in Vermont, he supported kind of a fringe left-wing party called the Liberty Union Party that at times had advocated for things as preposterous as secession of Vermont from the unions. Yeah. Like a Canadian-type socialist paradise. He sort of came out of nowhere. He did. Was never expected. He never was well-known. He never had high name recognition. Right. He came out of nowhere because he was completely the anti-Clinton. And also, he was never expected to do well. No. No, never. And the fact that he did as well as he did was surprising. He won dozens of states. Right. And he won states all over the country. Surprising, and I believe in many ways indicative of the zeitgeist that we're experiencing now, which is a moving away from both the traditional Democratic Party and the traditional Republican Party sort of elites and powers. For a long time, third-party candidates have attempted to run as independents or as libertarians, trying to attract voters by saying, you don't have to vote Democrat or Republican. And they were right. But curiously, nobody has listened to their instruction on how to avoid the Democrat or Republican. People still seem to be interested in either voting Democrat or Republican. And they're at a huge disadvantage. Because we don't have a French-type system with a two-round election. Exactly. Where we saw in France last year the complete collapse of traditional parties. The Socialist Party candidate, which was the biggest political party in France, their presidential candidate, Hamon, I think his name was Benoit Hamon, got 6% of the vote. Yeah. It's astonishing. He had Emmanuel Macron, who was not running with any party support. He was running as an independent. And he won. And he takes the thing out of nowhere. Completely out of left field. Yeah. And as unexpected as Macron's victory was on paper, the writing in many ways was on the wall going into that election. And the reason that that kind of thing is able to happen in Europe, sometimes it happens in Latin America as well, is because they have a second round. Because there is no second round in the States, the mechanism isn't really in place for anyone outside the two-party system to succeed. Voters and the constituencies have, in many ways, serendipitously enacted a form of revolt against their parties without choosing a third party, but just forcing their parties to transform. Yeah. Who would have ever thought that Donald Trump would take Republican primary and that Bernie Sanders would win 20-odd states and win 46% of the votes? And even though I don't think many people actually think Bernie Sanders could win, could have won even with the interference of the DNC, Hillary Clinton did have to flex every muscle, you know, everything she had. Twisting the arm of superdelegates, using the DNC when it's supposed to be neutral and impartial, and really using it as their own personal electoral vehicle. We're seeing revolution in both parties. We're seeing a rebellion. And we're seeing bases in both parties, a la Sanders and Trump, who say, screw you, to the party bosses. Absolutely. And that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. It could actually lead to very good results, good positive results. I think what's clear is that we are at a crossroads politically right now. And this could go either way. This could go in a very good direction with having the, where we end up having candidates for the Republicans and Democrats who more accurately represent their constituencies and more accurately represent the average Joes voting for them, or maybe lifetime Democrats and maybe lifetime Republicans who up until now have sort of just been forced into voting for whoever represented their party, whether they liked that candidate or not. So the Golden Globe Awards were, what were they on, Thursday or Friday? They were, I think, four days ago. At any rate, Rasmussen did a poll I think they were even longer ago. They might have been the weekend before that. Okay. Rasmussen did a poll this week, and surprise, surprise, Oprah Winfrey is leading Donald Trump by 10 points, 50% to 40%. And what some political commentators have said is that Rasmussen tends to skew a bit more Republican than the other polls. So it might actually be that Oprah really is leading right now by 12 or 13 or 14 points. Then again, it's three years and two months before an election. Yeah. The question is, what can she do, or what could she do to maintain that popularity all that time? It's a little premature, and it could end up backfiring. People might be tired of her. If the election were this year, I think it's very likely she would win. So Oprah, I have never actually seen, uh, an episode of Oprah's show. I'm assuming you have. Well, I'm, I'm familiar with the format. I don't think I've seen an episode from, from minute to minute. It seems like, beginning to end. If you sum up what her show is about, it's about self-empowerment. Yeah. It's about empathy. It's about understanding. It's about, uh, I mean, in some respects, I think. She's a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination. And what, and she talks about things that I like. I mean, I don't know if, for example, Oprah probably wouldn't say, the, the way to be successful is go get on a bunch of government programs. The way to be successful is take responsibility for your own life. If she, if Oprah came out and said stuff like that, she might be a more attractive candidate than someone like a Donald Trump. That's a good. She's very diplomatic, I get the sense. She's not gonna, she's not gonna be like someone like a Donald Trump that's just gonna say, Mexican, you know. There's always a way that you can kind of excuse what Donald Trump said. But there's still no excuse for some things he said because it's just so gratuitous, you know. It's a very good point and one that I actually hadn't considered until now. Um, what if Oprah goes the centrist route? I just sort of assumed she would go hardline Democrat. But what if she went the centrist route and actually appealed, as you said, to disenfranchised Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, people who believe in, in, um, the American way, making, making it on your own. I don't think of her as hardline. Enterprise and industry. Yeah, I think of her as, well, I don't know. Because I don't, she hasn't, the focus of her show has not been politics. It's been more like human interest. It's been more like, you know, we need to, uh, we need to transform society and we need to transform individual lives. But I don't think of her as a hard left type person. I don't think of her as a Bernie Sanders type person. I think of her as kind of more of a centrist. Well, I guess she could go either way. I still bet that she would go the far left way. Just because the, the show, while it's not political per se, it has a certain flavor of feelings and empathy and, um, a sort of lack of objectivity, if you will. But the field on that side is going to be so crowded. You're going to have, Bernie Sanders is certain to run. I think everyone thinks he's running. He's the front runner. Elizabeth Warren, and if he doesn't run, Elizabeth Warren is almost certain to run. And they actually may both run. I, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they both run. And then you, you have other people on the left, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. Well, just think of how crowded the Republican side was at the beginning. 17 candidates. Yeah. I don't think. It was crazy. I don't think it, I mean, I think it's likely that all the people Heather too mentioned do run on the Democratic side, but that there won't be a hindrance once it comes down to it. To the, to the final two. And you have Joe Biden. Right. You have Joe Biden, who's, who's also likely to run. I mean, what is rather amusing though here is that all of the candidates, both Trump and the half dozen leading candidates on the Democratic side, are pretty old. Kamala Harris, maybe, I think in her late fifties, Cory Booker is maybe the youngest one. He might be right around 50, but, uh, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, these people are all hovering around 70. I think Biden is actually, I think Sanders actually is going to be 78 or 79 come 2020. Yeah, she does. She's essentially be sharing the stage with the same old white people that she's famously spoken out against. Old white people. I mean, Bernie, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, even though they're, they're popular in their own way and they pull like reasonably well, that doesn't really seem to me like the fresh new invigorating face of the Democratic party. No. Which could be a good sign for someone like Oprah, who's just so different. So out of left field. And they thought that just by virtue of Clinton being a woman, that that would be enough of a different thing, enough of an edgy thing, enough of a quote unquote progressive thing. But it, it, it, but it clearly wasn't. But now if we have a woman that's also black, that's also, uh, famous, has a huge following in her own right. Uh, how, how old is, is Oprah? Because she's got that advantage, I think as well against the, the other, uh, against her potential Democratic rivals. But, um, I think she's about 60. Yeah. Which in political terms, 63. Yeah. Which is born 1954 in Mississippi. Yeah. Which if, if, I mean, if this were sports, it'd be too old, but for, for politics, it's, it's a, it's a prime age. Um, I think what this really is going to come down to is can she maintain this much, uh, um, can she stay in the public spotlight for this long? Can she trend for three plus years? Yeah, it is a long time. Although it, well, it is, it's going to be two years to the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, which will both be in the January of, uh, 2020. Yeah. So, but I mean, even if, even if, even if she keeps people talking about her until then, um, how is she going to do the, the, the other Trumpian thing, which is to keep stunning and in Trump's case, shocking, but in, in some way, at least to keep stunning and surprising and maintaining people talking about her, even, even during the campaign.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 2.14, "text": " I

"ori_dict": {"text": " I think in some ways this could be a bad sign of things to come, a negative sign of things to come, where essentially U.S. presidential politics turns into just a sort of popularity contest. A reality TV series from New Hampshire and Iowa all the way through the general election, something like that? Exactly. Like who's in the public sphere? Who's in the public eye who most encapsules people's frustrations and what's most important to them at the moment? Because that certainly seems to be the wave that Donald Trump rode all the way into the White House. So let's talk about Oprah's positives right off the bat. She starts out with almost instant universal name recognition. There's almost no one in America who doesn't know who Oprah Winfrey was. And she starts out with, I'm not sure what her net worth is, but I believe it's over a billion. I think she's low single-digit billions. So she could entirely self-fund her campaign. She doesn't have to worry about fundraising. Yeah, in many ways she has the same advantages that Trump was able to exploit. Exactly. Only she has the further advantage that he's already written the blueprint that she just has to follow. Obviously different ideology, but the same sort of bombastic enough is enough, we've had enough of this. And we know that it's not all right-wing because a lot of the people that actually voted for Donald Trump were the same people that voted for Barack Obama. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And in a strange way, Barack Obama is a sort of blueprint, the sort of prototype even for someone like Oprah Winfrey or Donald Trump, even though he was obviously a politician, but in some ways an outsider, in some ways an underdog. And against Hillary, curiously, Oprah Winfrey supported Barack Obama and not Hillary Clinton, which in a strange twist of events could end up being advantageous to her in the future. And then in 2016, of course, she endorsed Hillary Clinton. What we've seen recently in the Democratic Party is a real divide between a kind of more mainstream DNC-type faction that backed first Bill Clinton and now Hillary Clinton and the Bernie Sanders wing. And Bernie has some close allies, people like, say, Elizabeth Warren or Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio. How would Oprah fit into the Democratic Party? Would she be more, I don't think of her as some real left-wing activist type. No, I don't. I don't really know what her political views are, to be perfectly honest. I mean, I know she's a Democrat, but where would she fit into a Democratic primary? That's a great question. And if it weren't, again, if it weren't for Trump, I would probably just dismiss the prospect of an Oprah presidency outright. But you said it yourself, you don't know what her platform would be. I still don't know what Donald Trump's platform is entirely, to be honest. And he's constantly hiring, firing, disputing, feuding with people that are supposedly on his side, people that helped him get elected. It does get a little tiresome after a while. Indeed. It's just like a revolving door at the Trump White House. And I think with Winfrey, we could see something similar on the DNC side, with her not really coming from a political background, so not necessarily having core beliefs. I don't believe Trump has core beliefs. You could argue that either way. But I don't believe Trump has core beliefs, and I think it's unlikely Winfrey does either. She'd just rely on her cabinet, which could be as subject to change as Trump's is now. So the people that are consistently batted about right now in a Democratic primary, you of course have Bernie Sanders, who seems to be the frontrunner right now, even though I still don't think he can win a Democratic nomination. I suspect that he's a shill with no intention to win from the beginning. He might have been a plant to lose to Hillary from the onset. And he's not even a Democrat. That's the funniest thing of all. He is not now, nor has never been a Democrat in any way, shape, or form. When he was back in Vermont, he supported kind of a fringe left-wing party called the Liberty Union Party that at times had advocated for things as preposterous as secession of Vermont from the unions. Yeah. Like a Canadian-type socialist paradise. He sort of came out of nowhere. He did. Was never expected. He never was well-known. He never had high name recognition. Right. He came out of nowhere because he was completely the anti-Clinton. And also, he was never expected to do well. No. No, never. And the fact that he did as well as he did was surprising. He won dozens of states. Right. And he won states all over the country. Surprising, and I believe in many ways indicative of the zeitgeist that we're experiencing now, which is a moving away from both the traditional Democratic Party and the traditional Republican Party sort of elites and powers. For a long time, third-party candidates have attempted to run as independents or as libertarians, trying to attract voters by saying, you don't have to vote Democrat or Republican. And they were right. But curiously, nobody has listened to their instruction on how to avoid the Democrat or Republican. People still seem to be interested in either voting Democrat or Republican. And they're at a huge disadvantage. Because we don't have a French-type system with a two-round election. Exactly. Where we saw in France last year the complete collapse of traditional parties. The Socialist Party candidate, which was the biggest political party in France, their presidential candidate, Hamon, I think his name was Benoit Hamon, got 6% of the vote. Yeah. It's astonishing. He had Emmanuel Macron, who was not running with any party support. He was running as an independent. And he won. And he takes the thing out of nowhere. Completely out of left field. Yeah. And as unexpected as Macron's victory was on paper, the writing in many ways was on the wall going into that election. And the reason that that kind of thing is able to happen in Europe, sometimes it happens in Latin America as well, is because they have a second round. Because there is no second round in the States, the mechanism isn't really in place for anyone outside the two-party system to succeed. Voters and the constituencies have, in many ways, serendipitously enacted a form of revolt against their parties without choosing a third party, but just forcing their parties to transform. Yeah. Who would have ever thought that Donald Trump would take Republican primary and that Bernie Sanders would win 20-odd states and win 46% of the votes? And even though I don't think many people actually think Bernie Sanders could win, could have won even with the interference of the DNC, Hillary Clinton did have to flex every muscle, you know, everything she had. Twisting the arm of superdelegates, using the DNC when it's supposed to be neutral and impartial, and really using it as their own personal electoral vehicle. We're seeing revolution in both parties. We're seeing a rebellion. And we're seeing bases in both parties, a la Sanders and Trump, who say, screw you, to the party bosses. Absolutely. And that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. It could actually lead to very good results, good positive results. I think what's clear is that we are at a crossroads politically right now. And this could go either way. This could go in a very good direction with having the, where we end up having candidates for the Republicans and Democrats who more accurately represent their constituencies and more accurately represent the average Joes voting for them, or maybe lifetime Democrats and maybe lifetime Republicans who up until now have sort of just been forced into voting for whoever represented their party, whether they liked that candidate or not. So the Golden Globe Awards were, what were they on, Thursday or Friday? They were, I think, four days ago. At any rate, Rasmussen did a poll I think they were even longer ago. They might have been the weekend before that. Okay. Rasmussen did a poll this week, and surprise, surprise, Oprah Winfrey is leading Donald Trump by 10 points, 50% to 40%. And what some political commentators have said is that Rasmussen tends to skew a bit more Republican than the other polls. So it might actually be that Oprah really is leading right now by 12 or 13 or 14 points. Then again, it's three years and two months before an election. Yeah. The question is, what can she do, or what could she do to maintain that popularity all that time? It's a little premature, and it could end up backfiring. People might be tired of her. If the election were this year, I think it's very likely she would win. So Oprah, I have never actually seen, uh, an episode of Oprah's show. I'm assuming you have. Well, I'm, I'm familiar with the format. I don't think I've seen an episode from, from minute to minute. It seems like, beginning to end. If you sum up what her show is about, it's about self-empowerment. Yeah. It's about empathy. It's about understanding. It's about, uh, I mean, in some respects, I think. She's a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination. And what, and she talks about things that I like. I mean, I don't know if, for example, Oprah probably wouldn't say, the, the way to be successful is go get on a bunch of government programs. The way to be successful is take responsibility for your own life. If she, if Oprah came out and said stuff like that, she might be a more attractive candidate than someone like a Donald Trump. That's a good. She's very diplomatic, I get the sense. She's not gonna, she's not gonna be like someone like a Donald Trump that's just gonna say, Mexican, you know. There's always a way that you can kind of excuse what Donald Trump said. But there's still no excuse for some things he said because it's just so gratuitous, you know. It's a very good point and one that I actually hadn't considered until now. Um, what if Oprah goes the centrist route? I just sort of assumed she would go hardline Democrat. But what if she went the centrist route and actually appealed, as you said, to disenfranchised Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, people who believe in, in, um, the American way, making, making it on your own. I don't think of her as hardline. Enterprise and industry. Yeah, I think of her as, well, I don't know. Because I don't, she hasn't, the focus of her show has not been politics. It's been more like human interest. It's been more like, you know, we need to, uh, we need to transform society and we need to transform individual lives. But I don't think of her as a hard left type person. I don't think of her as a Bernie Sanders type person. I think of her as kind of more of a centrist. Well, I guess she could go either way. I still bet that she would go the far left way. Just because the, the show, while it's not political per se, it has a certain flavor of feelings and empathy and, um, a sort of lack of objectivity, if you will. But the field on that side is going to be so crowded. You're going to have, Bernie Sanders is certain to run. I think everyone thinks he's running. He's the front runner. Elizabeth Warren, and if he doesn't run, Elizabeth Warren is almost certain to run. And they actually may both run. I, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they both run. And then you, you have other people on the left, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. Well, just think of how crowded the Republican side was at the beginning. 17 candidates. Yeah. I don't think. It was crazy. I don't think it, I mean, I think it's likely that all the people Heather too mentioned do run on the Democratic side, but that there won't be a hindrance once it comes down to it. To the, to the final two. And you have Joe Biden. Right. You have Joe Biden, who's, who's also likely to run. I mean, what is rather amusing though here is that all of the candidates, both Trump and the half dozen leading candidates on the Democratic side, are pretty old. Kamala Harris, maybe, I think in her late fifties, Cory Booker is maybe the youngest one. He might be right around 50, but, uh, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, these people are all hovering around 70. I think Biden is actually, I think Sanders actually is going to be 78 or 79 come 2020. Yeah, she does. She's essentially be sharing the stage with the same old white people that she's famously spoken out against. Old white people. I mean, Bernie, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, even though they're, they're popular in their own way and they pull like reasonably well, that doesn't really seem to me like the fresh new invigorating face of the Democratic party. No. Which could be a good sign for someone like Oprah, who's just so different. So out of left field. And they thought that just by virtue of Clinton being a woman, that that would be enough of a different thing, enough of an edgy thing, enough of a quote unquote progressive thing. But it, it, it, but it clearly wasn't. But now if we have a woman that's also black, that's also, uh, famous, has a huge following in her own right. Uh, how, how old is, is Oprah? Because she's got that advantage, I think as well against the, the other, uh, against her potential Democratic rivals. But, um, I think she's about 60. Yeah. Which in political terms, 63. Yeah. Which is born 1954 in Mississippi. Yeah. Which if, if, I mean, if this were sports, it'd be too old, but for, for politics, it's, it's a, it's a prime age. Um, I think what this really is going to come down to is can she maintain this much, uh, um, can she stay in the public spotlight for this long? Can she trend for three plus years? Yeah, it is a long time. Although it, well, it is, it's going to be two years to the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, which will both be in the January of, uh, 2020. Yeah. So, but I mean, even if, even if, even if she keeps people talking about her until then, um, how is she going to do the, the, the other Trumpian thing, which is to keep stunning and in Trump's case, shocking, but in, in some way, at least to keep stunning and surprising and maintaining people talking about her, even, even during the campaign.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.38,
