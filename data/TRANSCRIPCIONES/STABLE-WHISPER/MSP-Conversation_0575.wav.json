{"text": " So I guess we can rewind a little bit to election night. I don't know if anybody watched the end of the world podcast with Joe Rogan, Bill Burr. We tried to watch it, but it was, it was Bert Chrysler. I can't talk. Hashtag Bert is fat. Chrysler. You know that guy. Chrysler. Tony Hinchcliffe made an appearance. Joey Diaz was supposed to be there, but he never showed up. Yeah. All night they kept saying, Joey Diaz. And Joe Rogan's like, any minute now, he'll be here any minute now, you know, Joe. And then it was like, never came. He never showed up. But anyway, I, well, no show Joe. It wasn't working on YouTube for us that night. And the next day at work, they had up, Jamie had uploaded it and I was cracking. Bill Burr is the funniest motherfucker of my life. Why isn't he our friend? Okay. That's like, I want to go to their house and hang out with Nia. I know. And Chloe. So I hope Chloe doesn't bite me. Dude. I feel like Nia would be like our best friend ever. He's like, Chloe got it. Okay. Come on, baby. If something ever happens and we do get famous, Nia, you're going to be our best friend. You just are. We're coming for you. You don't even know it. You don't have a say so in this. We're just going to show up and be like, girl, we'll have Moscato and everything. I don't know. Is she into Moscato? I feel like she'd be into Moscato. We could make her. Well, I'm just really excited because there's all these really good comedy tours coming close to us, which I feel like doesn't happen very often. So Tom Segura is coming to downtown Clearwater. December? I think it's in January. That one's in January. Bill Burr. Bill Burr's in February. Is he coming to Orlando? No, it's Daytona. But I mean, it's only like 45 minutes past Orlando. So I mean, if you're going to Orlando, it's not. It's either there or Gainesville. And Gainesville is just a college town. There's nothing else there. So I really would not want to spend the night there, really. And plus, I'm almost 30 years old. So I feel like everyone would be like, get off the street, grandma. Like frat boys would be like, you old bitch. You're like grandma out of the home. I don't think anyone's going to say that to us. We look fairly young. Not 19 young. I mean, no, not that young. I mean, not even close. But oh, we were talking about that at work today about like the weird things you've been ID'd for. Oh, damn. Did I tell you about my 21st birthday? It was the worst time ever. I went to well, it wasn't on my birthday. It was shortly after, but it was the first time that I was going to go out and celebrate as a 21 year old and drink. And I was in Kentucky. I just moved back from Texas and I went to Fourth Street. And they have this thing called Fourth Street Live. Have you been down there for that? No, nobody would ever go with me, but I know it's downtown Louisville. And it's actually I mean, it was pretty cool back then. And I was like, super pumped. I'm like, yeah, fucking Fourth Street. I finally get to go. They took my ID away and called the police on me. And it was your real birthday. Yeah. They took my ID and called the police. Well, we were talking. And they were like, what kind of bullshit is this? This doesn't even look like a real ID. This looks like shit. And I'm like, it's real. Like, it's my birthday. My birthday sucked. Well, we were talking about things that like normal people buy and they just like white out spray paint. I've gotten ID'd for acetone nail polish remover before. I got ID'd for some bullshit the other day. Yeah, I'm like. I think it was lighter fluid. I think they ID'd. I'm like, what do you think I'm doing? I think it was like liquid plumber or something weird. It was like some really random cleaning item that I got ID'd for. And I was like, what is this about? I don't know. I guess you can make bombs with it. But I mean. Maybe that's what they're doing now. They're trying to ID like bomb making items and shit since terror is like. But they don't take like a copy of your ID and know who. It's not like Sudafed where they you have to sign a book. At Walmart, they'll scan your ID, though, don't they? I think they just look at it. Oh, I don't know. I'd have to pay attention and see what they do with it. I'd say if they're scan. It depends on what they're doing. If they're just ID'ing you to see how old you are, then that's weird. And I don't understand. But if they're ID'ing you and scanning the backup, like they do a Sudafed and shit, then they may just be keeping track of people. I don't think they were because I remember I was I didn't even think about it. And I went to the self checkout when I was I forget I was spray painting something and I ran out of spray paint and I ran in there and it was crazy and I didn't want to wait in the line. So I just went to the automatic checkout and it was like, wait for associate. And they came over like, we need to see your ID for this. I was like, why do I look? I mean, maybe I do, but I didn't. I don't think I look like someone who huffs paint. I mean, but I guess they come in all sizes and shapes and colors. But I don't know. So, you know, I feel like things are really taking a turn already with the Donald. Oh, boy. It's weird. It's so surreal. I don't even like at first I was like, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What's going to happen? I don't know. Oh, God. Like I was freaking the fuck out for like a day. Like I started like getting real depressed and shit. I was like, we're all going to die. But then everyone's like, like, kumbaya and chill all of a sudden. Well, no, kind of. And you know what? I mean, not the civilians, but like world leaders are all kumbaya and cool. I am really sick of people sharing fake news stories on Facebook. What? Which ones? It'll just be like some crazy headline. Like, I don't know. I can't even think of like what outrageous thing I've heard. Like, it'll be something way over the top. Like, uh, I know I can't even think of one that was crazy, but something that is just clearly not real. I saw one earlier and it said it was on Google News, though. It said Trump's first. Trump's first ambassador, Colin Barack Obama. And I was like, what's that mean? Is that something official? Holy shit. And then when you look at it, it was just they said that because Barack Obama said something positive about Donald Trump. And I'm like, why did you make a news story? Out of this? And why did you make a headline that looked like Donald Trump just did something crazy? Because like, that's the big thing right now is we're waiting to see who he's appointing to like the members of his little cabinet thing. And so you see that and you're like, what? What's going on? Is Barack Obama cool with Donald Trump now? Well, like to be part of his cabinet. What's happening? This is what drives me crazy is people keep sharing these articles. And then at the bottom, it'll say where the link is from. And it'll be like goofnews.com or something. So no one's even reading it. Yeah, but the people are like, I knew these motherfuckers. And then they'll like share some crazy article and it'll be like, gotcha. This shit is fake.com. And I'm like, did you even look at that? I think there's a point to it, though. I think it's one of those things where the purpose is to out people that are sharing bullshit and that are just spreading things blindly. But to make them look. Yeah, but it's like meant to make people look stupid. But I feel like the people that they're being outed to already know what's real and what's fake. And the other people are like going along with it. They're like, I always knew it. And I'm like, wait, you're all a bunch of fucking idiots. Dumbasses. Everyone's crazy right now. Like, I don't even know what to say about it. Like, everyone's on level 10. Everyone's either like scared for their life and their children or they are like super pro Trump. And they're like, it's been a long time coming. Fuck you. And it's like, OK, everybody chill. Can I tell you what my theory is? And I could be wrong. I could be wrong. But this is what I feel like is going on here. I feel like. An egg on my face, if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say it. But the the lover in me feels like the lover. Donald Trump might be. The like best evil mastermind ever, because I feel like he might have known what he was doing all along. And what if he is like the world's greatest actor? Because, listen, hear me out now. OK, so he was saying all this shit that got that hit people's prejudice and bigoted button just the right way. And it was a whole group, not just one group of people, but he hit a bunch of buttons for a bunch of different people because the people that support him, you can't put them all in one group. It's a wide variety of people. But he was pushing buttons that people in all those groups wanted to hear. And he was saying crazy things like the wall. Who's going to build it? Mexico and all that. Like he had these people like. Mexico. Yeah. You would have thought they were in the fucking like Dragon Ball, the ultimate tournament. They're like. Motherfucking Super Saiyan. Yeah. I thought they were going to start glowing at any second with electricity. But of hatred. The hatred just came up through their body so intensely. But now when you turn Super Saiyan, you're using using internal powers. Well, I was actually. Unless you're Vegeta. Well, I. My mind kind of went to his name from Street Fighter from Brazil. Oh, Blanca. Yeah. Blanca balls. I feel like the crazy Trump supporters were a mix between a Dragon Ball Z character and Blanca from Street Fighter at the rallies. So. But OK. So he made them go real crazy and they got behind people who wouldn't normally go for like all these backwoods country good old boys like they're for the city boy. You know, like they would. That wouldn't necessarily be their guy under ordinary circumstances. But he was saying. Things and getting them behind him. Because he put on that trucker hat, man. Well, I was part of the game. He knew exactly what to say to these people. Just how far to push it. And once he pushed it over the line when he was like doing the real crazy shit like. I don't know. Yeah. Like. Acting special. Yeah. And people still were like, I mean, it's fine. Then I do. You know why? Because he's doing the shit that. OK. I think he is basically like in this weird. Way. He is the whipping boy for all these things that people are getting bashed for on social media. So people automatically sympathize. And here's what I mean by this is like white people. And I'm not saying all white people because they're definitely racist white people. But like white people that just might say one thing that might be kind of misconstrued as racist. And then someone's like, oh, you motherfucking racist. And then they just like go on a tangent and just bash the fuck out of that person. And, you know, they may be like, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything. But inside that might have really fucked them up. That might have really hurt somebody's feelings. And so now they have this predisposition to have sympathy towards Donald. If he does something that's kind of racist, but not really, then they automatically identify with that. They're like, yeah, yeah. He didn't really do anything that bad. Fuck everybody. Everyone's crazy. I identify with that situation. So I think that kind of goes hand in hand with the acting situation. I think he knew what to do. He needed to go over the line with how far he needed to go over the line when he needed to take it back and apologize when he didn't. I mean, he's smart. He's a smart guy. He's not an idiot. People want to think he's an idiot, but he's not a bajillionaire for no fucking reason. And it's not because he's necessarily like the best person ever in a Boy Scout. It's because he's smart and knows how to manipulate and utilize his resources. Well, back to my plot. I think he knew exactly what he was doing the whole time. I think he was super calculated. When people thought that he was being like a loose cannon, it was all calculated, I feel like. I think so, too. He didn't do anything. A couple years ago, like not that long ago, way before he even thought about running for president or whatever, he identified himself as a liberal Democrat. Yeah. And that whole thing that they kept sharing on the Internet from like 93 or whatever, he said, if I ran as I would run as a Republican because they would eat it up, blah, blah, blah. They're all so dumb. Stupid. Well, he did it and they ate it all up. And I'm not saying all the people that voted for him are dumb. I'm not saying that whatsoever. But he hit a nerve with a lot of people that were like, fuck, yeah. And I think that he. I'm not going to say he doesn't believe anything that he said, but I feel like he really hammed it up and made it seem one way when actually I don't really think that he thinks half the things. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous and that unrighteous. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous and that unrighteous. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous. How many things were we doing back then that don't make sense to a country of however many million people? It doesn't make sense anymore. I don't understand why we can't do the popular vote. We have electronic voting now. I mean, they scan everything in. So it's not someone. It's not like someone sitting there counting 30 million votes. It's not happening. I know it's all. So why isn't the popular vote the thing? That's the true representation of the people. If you count every single vote, that's what the people want. Yeah. And I'm not saying that I wanted that either because that would have made Hillary win. But. I think that this isn't the first election that's been fucked up by Electoral College versus popular vote. So I think that he honestly. It's been a long time and there's been very few. But there. But I think that he wanted to shake up politics so bad that he was willing to be the martyr to do it. That's what I think. And I feel like he's not going to do all the crazy because he already took the Muslim ban thing off his Web site. He hasn't said anything really about the wall, except I think they issued a statement saying that there would be a 70 foot fenced area or something. Something weird like that. And then all the things that they've been all the things that I've seen that people are sharing about what he said about abortion and stuff. If you look at it, all this. I mean, I don't know about everything, but the things that I've seen people share are all from before the election when he was still like saying, yeah, here's the thing. And a lot of people aren't going to like me saying it just because it's going to sound pro Trump. And I'm not just so that we start this off on the right foot. I voted for Gary Johnson. I was scared as a motherfucker of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I didn't trust either one. I don't blame anyone for being pro anybody. You believe in whoever you want to believe in. If someone if you listen to a candidate and they identify with what you believe in, I have no problem with whoever you believe in. I really don't. But I will say that those motherfuckers scared me now. Wait, what was I saying? Shit. What motherfucker scared me? Donald Trump and Hillary. Oh, that's why I didn't vote for. Oh, but oh, I was saying this is going to sound pro Donald. That's what I was saying. I lost my train of thought. One thing that. You have to shit. You have to keep in mind is that he was kind of right about the press, like taking shit and running wild with it, because if you really listen to the one thing that everybody got super upset about is he said that women should be punished for having abortions. That's not really what he said. If you listen to everything in the correct context, the guy asked him if abortions were made illegal, like if they were just illegal and in places where they're not legal, if people go through illegal means to have abortions like back alley abortions and shit is basically what he's talking about or doctors running clinics like low key unregistered. Should the people be punished? Should the women be punished for seeking the abortions through those, you know, illegal. Places. And he said, yeah, I think there needs to be punishment if they're doing it illegally. Everyone took that and ran crazy with it. If you were going into a fucking alley to have your baby killed, then that's a little different than going to a clinic to have an abortion, because then it's it's just really shady and fucked up and you're engaging in so like a lot of illegal practices just in general. You'd be arrested if you went into an alley to get your kidney. Like replaced. I mean, it's the same kind of principle. So on that note, I will say I don't think he was crazy from the jump on abortion, but everybody wanted him to be crazy. Well, Mike Pence is crazy on abortion. Oh, yeah. He's fucking crazy. He's an asshole. He also wants gay people to have conversion therapy. That's not happening. Well, you know, but I would like more details on that. Does he really think that gay people need to have electrodes strapped to their head or is he in support of something like if a gay person doesn't want to be gay and wants to seek help, should there be options available to them? That might be a touchy subject. I that would be weird. Like, is that what he means? I don't know what he means. Like, I'm legitimately asking, what does what does he mean? I'm not even going to step into that pool because I have no idea. And anything I want to know if I need to hate this guy or not, anything I could possibly say on the subject would be completely unfounded and probably ignorant. So I don't I really don't know. Well, that's a it's a good call to shut up. But the thing that was driving me crazy is that besides the candidates is this whole election brought out a side of everyone on the left and the right. Oh, yeah. That was super, super ugly. And I did not like it. And people are still I think people are still crazy. I think today was the first day I but I wasn't really on Facebook that much, but I didn't see too much crazy stuff today. But even as of Monday of this week, almost a week after the election, people were still like, if you voted for that homophobe, delete me and all this. It's like. I don't whatever happened to you don't have to agree with every single thing that someone says, but you don't hate them as a person. I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about the people that voted for him. Like, I don't hate every single person that voted for Hillary. I don't hate every single person that voted for Donald Trump. I might not agree with what they said, but doesn't make me hate everything about their life, which is what I've seen a lot of from people. It's like, well, you must be this, that and the other. And I don't want anything to do with you. It's like, you're really going to choose your the people in your life that have always been in your life if they get to stay or not based on who they voted for in the presidential election. And then the other thing is that really a qualifier. And shit, because they're letting kids do mock elections. And then there's like, I don't know. I don't agree with that in general, just because the way this election was so emotionally charged, like no other election was. I don't think that they should have done that in schools because kids are now getting bullied and fucked up, like fucked with because of it.", "segments": [{"start": 0.36, "end": 3.38, "text": " So I

little bit to election night. I don't know if anybody watched the end of the world podcast with Joe Rogan, Bill Burr. We tried to watch it, but it was, it was Bert Chrysler. I can't talk. Hashtag Bert is fat. Chrysler. You know that guy. Chrysler. Tony Hinchcliffe made an appearance. Joey Diaz was supposed to be there, but he never showed up. Yeah. All night they kept saying, Joey Diaz. And Joe Rogan's like, any minute now, he'll be here any minute now, you know, Joe. And then it was like, never came. He never showed up. But anyway, I, well, no show Joe. It wasn't working on YouTube for us that night. And the next day at work, they had up, Jamie had uploaded it and I was cracking. Bill Burr is the funniest motherfucker of my life. Why isn't he our friend? Okay. That's like, I want to go to their house and hang out with Nia. I know. And Chloe. So I hope Chloe doesn't bite me. Dude. I feel like Nia would be like our best friend ever. He's like, Chloe got it. Okay. Come on, baby. If something ever happens and we do get famous, Nia, you're going to be our best friend. You just are. We're coming for you. You don't even know it. You don't have a say so in this. We're just going to show up and be like, girl, we'll have Moscato and everything. I don't know. Is she into Moscato? I feel like she'd be into Moscato. We could make her. Well, I'm just really excited because there's all these really good comedy tours coming close to us, which I feel like doesn't happen very often. So Tom Segura is coming to downtown Clearwater. December? I think it's in January. That one's in January. Bill Burr. Bill Burr's in February. Is he coming to Orlando? No, it's Daytona. But I mean, it's only like 45 minutes past Orlando. So I mean, if you're going to Orlando, it's not. It's either there or Gainesville. And Gainesville is just a college town. There's nothing else there. So I really would not want to spend the night there, really. And plus, I'm almost 30 years old. So I feel like everyone would be like, get off the street, grandma. Like frat boys would be like, you old bitch. You're like grandma out of the home. I don't think anyone's going to say that to us. We look fairly young. Not 19 young. I mean, no, not that young. I mean, not even close. But oh, we were talking about that at work today about like the weird things you've been ID'd for. Oh, damn. Did I tell you about my 21st birthday? It was the worst time ever. I went to well, it wasn't on my birthday. It was shortly after, but it was the first time that I was going to go out and celebrate as a 21 year old and drink. And I was in Kentucky. I just moved back from Texas and I went to Fourth Street. And they have this thing called Fourth Street Live. Have you been down there for that? No, nobody would ever go with me, but I know it's downtown Louisville. And it's actually I mean, it was pretty cool back then. And I was like, super pumped. I'm like, yeah, fucking Fourth Street. I finally get to go. They took my ID away and called the police on me. And it was your real birthday. Yeah. They took my ID and called the police. Well, we were talking. And they were like, what kind of bullshit is this? This doesn't even look like a real ID. This looks like shit. And I'm like, it's real. Like, it's my birthday. My birthday sucked. Well, we were talking about things that like normal people buy and they just like white out spray paint. I've gotten ID'd for acetone nail polish remover before. I got ID'd for some bullshit the other day. Yeah, I'm like. I think it was lighter fluid. I think they ID'd. I'm like, what do you think I'm doing? I think it was like liquid plumber or something weird. It was like some really random cleaning item that I got ID'd for. And I was like, what is this about? I don't know. I guess you can make bombs with it. But I mean. Maybe that's what they're doing now. They're trying to ID like bomb making items and shit since terror is like. But they don't take like a copy of your ID and know who. It's not like Sudafed where they you have to sign a book. At Walmart, they'll scan your ID, though, don't they? I think they just look at it. Oh, I don't know. I'd have to pay attention and see what they do with it. I'd say if they're scan. It depends on what they're doing. If they're just ID'ing you to see how old you are, then that's weird. And I don't understand. But if they're ID'ing you and scanning the backup, like they do a Sudafed and shit, then they may just be keeping track of people. I don't think they were because I remember I was I didn't even think about it. And I went to the self checkout when I was I forget I was spray painting something and I ran out of spray paint and I ran in there and it was crazy and I didn't want to wait in the line. So I just went to the automatic checkout and it was like, wait for associate. And they came over like, we need to see your ID for this. I was like, why do I look? I mean, maybe I do, but I didn't. I don't think I look like someone who huffs paint. I mean, but I guess they come in all sizes and shapes and colors. But I don't know. So, you know, I feel like things are really taking a turn already with the Donald. Oh, boy. It's weird. It's so surreal. I don't even like at first I was like, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What's going to happen? I don't know. Oh, God. Like I was freaking the fuck out for like a day. Like I started like getting real depressed and shit. I was like, we're all going to die. But then everyone's like, like, kumbaya and chill all of a sudden. Well, no, kind of. And you know what? I mean, not the civilians, but like world leaders are all kumbaya and cool. I am really sick of people sharing fake news stories on Facebook. What? Which ones? It'll just be like some crazy headline. Like, I don't know. I can't even think of like what outrageous thing I've heard. Like, it'll be something way over the top. Like, uh, I know I can't even think of one that was crazy, but something that is just clearly not real. I saw one earlier and it said it was on Google News, though. It said Trump's first. Trump's first ambassador, Colin Barack Obama. And I was like, what's that mean? Is that something official? Holy shit. And then when you look at it, it was just they said that because Barack Obama said something positive about Donald Trump. And I'm like, why did you make a news story? Out of this? And why did you make a headline that looked like Donald Trump just did something crazy? Because like, that's the big thing right now is we're waiting to see who he's appointing to like the members of his little cabinet thing. And so you see that and you're like, what? What's going on? Is Barack Obama cool with Donald Trump now? Well, like to be part of his cabinet. What's happening? This is what drives me crazy is people keep sharing these articles. And then at the bottom, it'll say where the link is from. And it'll be like goofnews.com or something. So no one's even reading it. Yeah, but the people are like, I knew these motherfuckers. And then they'll like share some crazy article and it'll be like, gotcha. This shit is fake.com. And I'm like, did you even look at that? I think there's a point to it, though. I think it's one of those things where the purpose is to out people that are sharing bullshit and that are just spreading things blindly. But to make them look. Yeah, but it's like meant to make people look stupid. But I feel like the people that they're being outed to already know what's real and what's fake. And the other people are like going along with it. They're like, I always knew it. And I'm like, wait, you're all a bunch of fucking idiots. Dumbasses. Everyone's crazy right now. Like, I don't even know what to say about it. Like, everyone's on level 10. Everyone's either like scared for their life and their children or they are like super pro Trump. And they're like, it's been a long time coming. Fuck you. And it's like, OK, everybody chill. Can I tell you what my theory is? And I could be wrong. I could be wrong. But this is what I feel like is going on here. I feel like. An egg on my face, if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say it. But the the lover in me feels like the lover. Donald Trump might be. The like best evil mastermind ever, because I feel like he might have known what he was doing all along. And what if he is like the world's greatest actor? Because, listen, hear me out now. OK, so he was saying all this shit that got that hit people's prejudice and bigoted button just the right way. And it was a whole group, not just one group of people, but he hit a bunch of buttons for a bunch of different people because the people that support him, you can't put them all in one group. It's a wide variety of people. But he was pushing buttons that people in all those groups wanted to hear. And he was saying crazy things like the wall. Who's going to build it? Mexico and all that. Like he had these people like. Mexico. Yeah. You would have thought they were in the fucking like Dragon Ball, the ultimate tournament. They're like. Motherfucking Super Saiyan. Yeah. I thought they were going to start glowing at any second with electricity. But of hatred. The hatred just came up through their body so intensely. But now when you turn Super Saiyan, you're using using internal powers. Well, I was actually. Unless you're Vegeta. Well, I. My mind kind of went to his name from Street Fighter from Brazil. Oh, Blanca. Yeah. Blanca balls. I feel like the crazy Trump supporters were a mix between a Dragon Ball Z character and Blanca from Street Fighter at the rallies. So. But OK. So he made them go real crazy and they got behind people who wouldn't normally go for like all these backwoods country good old boys like they're for the city boy. You know, like they would. That wouldn't necessarily be their guy under ordinary circumstances. But he was saying. Things and getting them behind him. Because he put on that trucker hat, man. Well, I was part of the game. He knew exactly what to say to these people. Just how far to push it. And once he pushed it over the line when he was like doing the real crazy shit like. I don't know. Yeah. Like. Acting special. Yeah. And people still were like, I mean, it's fine. Then I do. You know why? Because he's doing the shit that. OK. I think he is basically like in this weird. Way. He is the whipping boy for all these things that people are getting bashed for on social media. So people automatically sympathize. And here's what I mean by this is like white people. And I'm not saying all white people because they're definitely racist white people. But like white people that just might say one thing that might be kind of misconstrued as racist. And then someone's like, oh, you motherfucking racist. And then they just like go on a tangent and just bash the fuck out of that person. And, you know, they may be like, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything. But inside that might have really fucked them up. That might have really hurt somebody's feelings. And so now they have this predisposition to have sympathy towards Donald. If he does something that's kind of racist, but not really, then they automatically identify with that. They're like, yeah, yeah. He didn't really do anything that bad. Fuck everybody. Everyone's crazy. I identify with that situation. So I think that kind of goes hand in hand with the acting situation. I think he knew what to do. He needed to go over the line with how far he needed to go over the line when he needed to take it back and apologize when he didn't. I mean, he's smart. He's a smart guy. He's not an idiot. People want to think he's an idiot, but he's not a bajillionaire for no fucking reason. And it's not because he's necessarily like the best person ever in a Boy Scout. It's because he's smart and knows how to manipulate and utilize his resources. Well, back to my plot. I think he knew exactly what he was doing the whole time. I think he was super calculated. When people thought that he was being like a loose cannon, it was all calculated, I feel like. I think so, too. He didn't do anything. A couple years ago, like not that long ago, way before he even thought about running for president or whatever, he identified himself as a liberal Democrat. Yeah. And that whole thing that they kept sharing on the Internet from like 93 or whatever, he said, if I ran as I would run as a Republican because they would eat it up, blah, blah, blah. They're all so dumb. Stupid. Well, he did it and they ate it all up. And I'm not saying all the people that voted for him are dumb. I'm not saying that whatsoever. But he hit a nerve with a lot of people that were like, fuck, yeah. And I think that he. I'm not going to say he doesn't believe anything that he said, but I feel like he really hammed it up and made it seem one way when actually I don't really think that he thinks half the things. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous and that unrighteous. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous and that unrighteous. And I think that he saw how fucked up politics were and he had to be that outrageous. How many things were we doing back then that don't make sense to a country of however many million people? It doesn't make sense anymore. I don't understand why we can't do the popular vote. We have electronic voting now. I mean, they scan everything in. So it's not someone. It's not like someone sitting there counting 30 million votes. It's not happening. I know it's all. So why isn't the popular vote the thing? That's the true representation of the people. If you count every single vote, that's what the people want. Yeah. And I'm not saying that I wanted that either because that would have made Hillary win. But. I think that this isn't the first election that's been fucked up by Electoral College versus popular vote. So I think that he honestly. It's been a long time and there's been very few. But there. But I think that he wanted to shake up politics so bad that he was willing to be the martyr to do it. That's what I think. And I feel like he's not going to do all the crazy because he already took the Muslim ban thing off his Web site. He hasn't said anything really about the wall, except I think they issued a statement saying that there would be a 70 foot fenced area or something. Something weird like that. And then all the things that they've been all the things that I've seen that people are sharing about what he said about abortion and stuff. If you look at it, all this. I mean, I don't know about everything, but the things that I've seen people share are all from before the election when he was still like saying, yeah, here's the thing. And a lot of people aren't going to like me saying it just because it's going to sound pro Trump. And I'm not just so that we start this off on the right foot. I voted for Gary Johnson. I was scared as a motherfucker of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I didn't trust either one. I don't blame anyone for being pro anybody. You believe in whoever you want to believe in. If someone if you listen to a candidate and they identify with what you believe in, I have no problem with whoever you believe in. I really don't. But I will say that those motherfuckers scared me now. Wait, what was I saying? Shit. What motherfucker scared me? Donald Trump and Hillary. Oh, that's why I didn't vote for. Oh, but oh, I was saying this is going to sound pro Donald. That's what I was saying. I lost my train of thought. One thing that. You have to shit. You have to keep in mind is that he was kind of right about the press, like taking shit and running wild with it, because if you really listen to the one thing that everybody got super upset about is he said that women should be punished for having abortions. That's not really what he said. If you listen to everything in the correct context, the guy asked him if abortions were made illegal, like if they were just illegal and in places where they're not legal, if people go through illegal means to have abortions like back alley abortions and shit is basically what he's talking about or doctors running clinics like low key unregistered. Should the people be punished? Should the women be punished for seeking the abortions through those, you know, illegal. Places. And he said, yeah, I think there needs to be punishment if they're doing it illegally. Everyone took that and ran crazy with it. If you were going into a fucking alley to have your baby killed, then that's a little different than going to a clinic to have an abortion, because then it's it's just really shady and fucked up and you're engaging in so like a lot of illegal practices just in general. You'd be arrested if you went into an alley to get your kidney. Like replaced. I mean, it's the same kind of principle. So on that note, I will say I don't think he was crazy from the jump on abortion, but everybody wanted him to be crazy. Well, Mike Pence is crazy on abortion. Oh, yeah. He's fucking crazy. He's an asshole. He also wants gay people to have conversion therapy. That's not happening. Well, you know, but I would like more details on that. Does he really think that gay people need to have electrodes strapped to their head or is he in support of something like if a gay person doesn't want to be gay and wants to seek help, should there be options available to them? That might be a touchy subject. I that would be weird. Like, is that what he means? I don't know what he means. Like, I'm legitimately asking, what does what does he mean? I'm not even going to step into that pool because I have no idea. And anything I want to know if I need to hate this guy or not, anything I could possibly say on the subject would be completely unfounded and probably ignorant. So I don't I really don't know. Well, that's a it's a good call to shut up. But the thing that was driving me crazy is that besides the candidates is this whole election brought out a side of everyone on the left and the right. Oh, yeah. That was super, super ugly. And I did not like it. And people are still I think people are still crazy. I think today was the first day I but I wasn't really on Facebook that much, but I didn't see too much crazy stuff today. But even as of Monday of this week, almost a week after the election, people were still like, if you voted for that homophobe, delete me and all this. It's like. I don't whatever happened to you don't have to agree with every single thing that someone says, but you don't hate them as a person. I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about the people that voted for him. Like, I don't hate every single person that voted for Hillary. I don't hate every single person that voted for Donald Trump. I might not agree with what they said, but doesn't make me hate everything about their life, which is what I've seen a lot of from people. It's like, well, you must be this, that and the other. And I don't want anything to do with you. It's like, you're really going to choose your the people in your life that have always been in your life if they get to stay or not based on who they voted for in the presidential election. And then the other thing is that really a qualifier. And shit, because they're letting kids do mock elections. And then there's like, I don't know. I don't agree with that in general, just because the way this election was so emotionally charged, like no other election was.
