{"text": " It seems more barbaric. Yes. It's, you know, go back to the Revolutionary War. Why was the one way we won? Because we fought different. Yeah. We did things against the norms of war. It's the same kind of thing here. I mean, they're pretty much ruthless. Yeah, yeah. You know, some people are scared, which is understandable. And you get scared, you make knee-jerk reactions. I mean, Lindsey Graham is really, he wants troops there. Our troops. Yeah. On the ground, you know. You've got Trump who wants to basically shut down open media and free speech and everything else. Wonderful. That's great. But, yeah, so, you know, I don't know. Rand will probably be gone soon enough. Yeah. Which means I can. Well, what at least is nice is you do have some different people, people that are different enough from establishment. You do have Cruz in there. I would be very happy with Cruz. My issue with Cruz is I'm not 100% sure that he's, I don't know, him and Trump are, they're a little buddy-buddy. And I don't like it. Yeah. I don't like it at all. Well, Trump's buddy-buddy with Hillary, too. Well, that, exactly. So, doesn't exactly, I'm saying I don't know that I like that Cruz is doing that. On the other hand, he might be doing that to avoid direct attacks from Trump. Yep. You know, I mean, other people. Or he's going to make him VP. Oh, that'd be awesome. Make Trump VP or Trump would make Cruz. Or Trump would make Cruz VP. I have heard that rumor that Trump would make Cruz VP. I don't know if Cruz would make Trump VP. What about Cruz Rand? I don't think Trump would, I'll get back to that. I don't think. What did you say? Don't worry about it. Trump will not be vice anything. He has to be number one. That's true. That's true. So, I can't see him saying, okay, I'll be the vice president. He's so outspoken. He's like, I have to follow. Cruz killed. I have to follow Cruz's lead? I hate somebody else. Brian, you said Cruz and Rand? Yeah. No. I can't see that happening. They get along pretty well. I've said this before. If you look at their voting records, with the exception of certain things on foreign policy, they're basically the same person. Yeah. I mean, they sponsor each other's bills all the time. They do filibusters together and that kind of thing. So, they're, it's. I just can't see it because to me it would be a weaker ticket than whatever Hillary's going to have. Cruz needs a strong running mate. What do you think Hillary's going to be? God, that'd be a train wreck. I don't know. I keep, to me, I almost feel like Hillary's going to be like, well, I'll just be both. I can do it all. Yeah. I'm a strong independent woman. The president doesn't really do much, though, until the president dies. Well, they're out of the Senate. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But really, what does that mean? What has Biden done? Nothing good. Sadly. Which is why I'm like, Hillary can do it, right? I think she'd be like, it's the Hillary ticket. It's the Hillary ticket. Yeah. Or Bill. That's a good question, though. Or Michelle Obama. Take Bill on. That's. I mean, she really was like his VP. She really ran his presidency. So. Oh, yeah. Why not? Can they do that? I think so. You know, because. He just can't be president again. But if she dies, then. Then I'm supposed they'd probably give it to the next person. Speaker? Yeah. Oh. Paul? Oh. Ryan? Oh. I mean, I guess it'd be better than Hillary, sort of. Yeah. Or Bernie. Yeah. Ooh. Don't get me. What if she picked Biden? Maybe that's why he didn't run. Oh. That would be something. Mm-hmm. Just status quo. Yeah. Another four years. Yeah. Eight years. It'll be eight. Yeah. We can only hope. We can only hope that Hillary goes with Biden. Oh. 16 years of Biden. I don't think Cruz can pick Rand just because he needs a strong ticket. He would need like, honestly, he'd need Kasich or someone from a swing state on his team. Oh, yeah. Okay. He needs that leverage. Kasich. Ugh. Yeah. Because Ohio is important. Yeah. Ohio, Florida. So we could either do Bush or Rubio at that. I mean. Ugh. He needs somebody from the swing states in order to guarantee that vote. Yeah. Then again, he can pick someone that isn't running. That's true. You know? Oh. So then that opens it up quite a bit. Yeah. Wouldn't it be awesome? Cruz, Paul? Romney? Romney? I could see it. Oh, no. I don't know if Cruz would pick him. I think the one. Oh, crap. I can't think of his name at the moment. I was just talking about him the other day. From Indiana. Oh, Mitch Daniels? Mitch Daniels. Yeah. That would be. I mean, you'd get Ohio without Kasich. Because of Mitch Daniels? Because of Mitch Daniels. That would be nice. Because he's a little bit. Mitchell Daniels. He's a little more moderate. Mm-hmm. But that would be, I mean, a great way to. And it would be a great way to swing some people away from Hillary because he has. He's conservative in enough stuff, but socially he's. He votes a little. Sports a little bit more liberal policies. You know, the gay marriage thing. I like that. That type of stuff. I like queers. My favorite. It'll be interesting. Huh. We'll see if Cruz can hold his lead for two more months. I mean, that. Yeah. That's key. That's going to be hard. Trump's got it. I mean. Easy. Trump and Carson and Walker. I mean, look at the switches already in Iowa. Right. That happened with. So it'll probably switch out one or two more times. It happened with. What's his name? In the last race with Romney. Yeah. Huckabee too. But like Romney. Was always pretty much number one. And then they're just. Herman Cain was like. Wow. Herman Cain's number one for a split second. Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while. Rick Perry was number one for a split second. He's my favorite. And look how fast he fell off. Yeah. Yeah. So it's right now we're like, hey, Cruz is in it and he's winning. It's like he's winning right now. He's winning because Trump made like two terrible, terrible comments. What were the two that he made? It was we're not letting any Muslims in. Oh, OK. And in my opinion, the next. Which actually would be worse is that he basically wants to. Oh, surveil. Survey all the. Yes. What's so bad with that, though? You don't like it. First. First Amendment. Right. You know, the whole free speech thing. I mean, is it really? I don't feel like it's really even there. Well, yeah, it's it's just weird. I mean, because it's kind of that whole. Well, they came for these people and I wasn't one of them. So, you know, I didn't care. And they go down the list and they say then they came for me and there was no one there left. Right. I don't know how that little saying goes exactly. Well. We'll see. Cruz Trump, though, that'd be pretty cool. I don't think that'll happen. Trump won't be a VP. I don't think you would just have him assassinated. And there you go. Goodbye, Cruz. Yeah. He's a martyr. You know, we will see him all move up and down, up and down. The one who has been consistently at the top or near the top since they entered, though, is Trump. Sadly. Yeah. Walker was doing good for a minute and he was the first one to drop out. He dropped out before Lindsay did. He dropped out. He dropped out to try and get more people to support someone other than Trump. Yeah. Right. But that's a great. I think after Walker left, that much of his voters went to Trump. Woo! He's like, oh, no. Trump 2016. That backfired. And he's like, hey, I can give my two percentage points to, you know, Rubio. Nope. You gave him Trump. Fuck. He was higher than two. He was up there. He was at a point, but didn't he? He dropped down pretty low. I think when he dropped out, I want to say he was around eight. Oh, he was that high? He was. Yeah. That's why it was like, what the fuck? Like, you know. Well, I mean, at that time. And there was a shit ton of candidates, too. Well, there still is a shit ton of candidates. That's not helping. Once more drop out, it'll level out even more. Yeah. I truly do believe that. Trump will just get more votes. I can't see Huckabee voters going to Trump. Huckabee? Yeah. I mean, come on. All 1.2? Well, some of them could, you know, because the social conservatives might really not like Muslims. But they're evangelical. Most of them are the evangelicals. They're not going to go to Trump. All the Muslim haters were going down to Trump. Well, yeah. I mean, everyone who doesn't like, you know, Muslims is going to love Trump because he says the horrible things that they are thinking. And that's so much the horrible things about Islam, because Islam is a crappy religion. Horrible. It's a wonder that they have a billion people that are in it. But the things where he's just like, I don't really care about the Constitution. I'm just going to surveil people. It's based on their religion. Yeah. Well, and everybody's just like, yes. Perfect.

Yes. It's, you know, go back to the Revolutionary War. Why was the one way we won? Because we fought different. Yeah. We did things against the norms of war. It's the same kind of thing here. I mean, they're pretty much ruthless. Yeah, yeah. You know, some people are scared, which is understandable. And you get scared, you make knee-jerk reactions. I mean, Lindsey Graham is really, he wants troops there. Our troops. Yeah. On the ground, you know. You've got Trump who wants to basically shut down open media and free speech and everything else. Wonderful. That's great. But, yeah, so, you know, I don't know. Rand will probably be gone soon enough. Yeah. Which means I can. Well, what at least is nice is you do have some different people, people that are different enough from establishment. You do have Cruz in there. I would be very happy with Cruz. My issue with Cruz is I'm not 100% sure that he's, I don't know, him and Trump are, they're a little buddy-buddy. And I don't like it. Yeah. I don't like it at all. Well, Trump's buddy-buddy with Hillary, too. Well, that, exactly. So, doesn't exactly, I'm saying I don't know that I like that Cruz is doing that. On the other hand, he might be doing that to avoid direct attacks from Trump. Yep. You know, I mean, other people. Or he's going to make him VP. Oh, that'd be awesome. Make Trump VP or Trump would make Cruz. Or Trump would make Cruz VP. I have heard that rumor that Trump would make Cruz VP. I don't know if Cruz would make Trump VP. What about Cruz Rand? I don't think Trump would, I'll get back to that. I don't think. What did you say? Don't worry about it. Trump will not be vice anything. He has to be number one. That's true. That's true. So, I can't see him saying, okay, I'll be the vice president. He's so outspoken. He's like, I have to follow. Cruz killed. I have to follow Cruz's lead? I hate somebody else. Brian, you said Cruz and Rand? Yeah. No. I can't see that happening. They get along pretty well. I've said this before. If you look at their voting records, with the exception of certain things on foreign policy, they're basically the same person. Yeah. I mean, they sponsor each other's bills all the time. They do filibusters together and that kind of thing. So, they're, it's. I just can't see it because to me it would be a weaker ticket than whatever Hillary's going to have. Cruz needs a strong running mate. What do you think Hillary's going to be? God, that'd be a train wreck. I don't know. I keep, to me, I almost feel like Hillary's going to be like, well, I'll just be both. I can do it all. Yeah. I'm a strong independent woman. The president doesn't really do much, though, until the president dies. Well, they're out of the Senate. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But really, what does that mean? What has Biden done? Nothing good. Sadly. Which is why I'm like, Hillary can do it, right? I think she'd be like, it's the Hillary ticket. It's the Hillary ticket. Yeah. Or Bill. That's a good question, though. Or Michelle Obama. Take Bill on. That's. I mean, she really was like his VP. She really ran his presidency. So. Oh, yeah. Why not? Can they do that? I think so. You know, because. He just can't be president again. But if she dies, then. Then I'm supposed they'd probably give it to the next person. Speaker? Yeah. Oh. Paul? Oh. Ryan? Oh. I mean, I guess it'd be better than Hillary, sort of. Yeah. Or Bernie. Yeah. Ooh. Don't get me. What if she picked Biden? Maybe that's why he didn't run. Oh. That would be something. Mm-hmm. Just status quo. Yeah. Another four years. Yeah. Eight years. It'll be eight. Yeah. We can only hope. We can only hope that Hillary goes with Biden. Oh. 16 years of Biden. I don't think Cruz can pick Rand just because he needs a strong ticket. He would need like, honestly, he'd need Kasich or someone from a swing state on his team. Oh, yeah. Okay. He needs that leverage. Kasich. Ugh. Yeah. Because Ohio is important. Yeah. Ohio, Florida. So we could either do Bush or Rubio at that. I mean. Ugh. He needs somebody from the swing states in order to guarantee that vote. Yeah. Then again, he can pick someone that isn't running. That's true. You know? Oh. So then that opens it up quite a bit. Yeah. Wouldn't it be awesome? Cruz, Paul? Romney? Romney? I could see it. Oh, no. I don't know if Cruz would pick him. I think the one. Oh, crap. I can't think of his name at the moment. I was just talking about him the other day. From Indiana. Oh, Mitch Daniels? Mitch Daniels. Yeah. That would be. I mean, you'd get Ohio without Kasich. Because of Mitch Daniels? Because of Mitch Daniels. That would be nice. Because he's a little bit. Mitchell Daniels. He's a little more moderate. Mm-hmm. But that would be, I mean, a great way to. And it would be a great way to swing some people away from Hillary because he has. He's conservative in enough stuff, but socially he's. He votes a little. Sports a little bit more liberal policies. You know, the gay marriage thing. I like that. That type of stuff. I like queers. My favorite. It'll be interesting. Huh. We'll see if Cruz can hold his lead for two more months. I mean, that. Yeah. That's key. That's going to be hard. Trump's got it. I mean. Easy. Trump and Carson and Walker. I mean, look at the switches already in Iowa. Right. That happened with. So it'll probably switch out one or two more times. It happened with. What's his name? In the last race with Romney. Yeah. Huckabee too. But like Romney. Was always pretty much number one. And then they're just. Herman Cain was like. Wow. Herman Cain's number one for a split second. Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while. Rick Perry was number one for a split second. He's my favorite. And look how fast he fell off. Yeah. Yeah. So it's right now we're like, hey, Cruz is in it and he's winning. It's like he's winning right now. He's winning because Trump made like two terrible, terrible comments. What were the two that he made? It was we're not letting any Muslims in. Oh, OK. And in my opinion, the next. Which actually would be worse is that he basically wants to. Oh, surveil. Survey all the. Yes. What's so bad with that, though? You don't like it. First. First Amendment. Right. You know, the whole free speech thing. I mean, is it really? I don't feel like it's really even there. Well, yeah, it's it's just weird. I mean, because it's kind of that whole. Well, they came for these people and I wasn't one of them. So, you know, I didn't care. And they go down the list and they say then they came for me and there was no one there left. Right. I don't know how that little saying goes exactly. Well. We'll see. Cruz Trump, though, that'd be pretty cool. I don't think that'll happen. Trump won't be a VP. I don't think you would just have him assassinated. And there you go. Goodbye, Cruz. Yeah. He's a martyr. You know, we will see him all move up and down, up and down. The one who has been consistently at the top or near the top since they entered, though, is Trump. Sadly. Yeah. Walker was doing good for a minute and he was the first one to drop out. He dropped out before Lindsay did. He dropped out. He dropped out to try and get more people to support someone other than Trump. Yeah. Right. But that's a great. I think after Walker left, that much of his voters went to Trump. Woo! He's like, oh, no. Trump 2016. That backfired. And he's like, hey, I can give my two percentage points to, you know, Rubio. Nope. You gave him Trump. Fuck. He was higher than two. He was up there. He was at a point, but didn't he? He dropped down pretty low. I think when he dropped out, I want to say he was around eight. Oh, he was that high? He was. Yeah. That's why it was like, what the fuck? Like, you know. Well, I mean, at that time. And there was a shit ton of candidates, too. Well, there still is a shit ton of candidates. That's not helping. Once more drop out, it'll level out even more. Yeah. I truly do believe that. Trump will just get more votes. I can't see Huckabee voters going to Trump. Huckabee? Yeah. I mean, come on. All 1.2? Well, some of them could, you know, because the social conservatives might really not like Muslims. But they're evangelical. Most of them are the evangelicals. They're not going to go to Trump. All the Muslim haters were going down to Trump. Well, yeah. I mean, everyone who doesn't like, you know, Muslims is going to love Trump because he says the horrible things that they are thinking. And that's so much the horrible things about Islam, because Islam is a crappy religion. Horrible. It's a wonder that they have a billion people that are in it. But the things where he's just like, I don't really care about the Constitution. I'm just going to surveil people. It's based on their religion. Yeah. Well, and everybody's just like, yes. Perfect.
