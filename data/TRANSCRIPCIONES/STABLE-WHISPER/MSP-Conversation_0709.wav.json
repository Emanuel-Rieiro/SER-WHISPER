{"text": " you're just talking to the wall yes it was funny i don't know why do you want to explain where there's a painter guy out right in front of our apartment yeah and he could at any moment start maybe singing or we came in coughing or scraping we're in a different we're in a different situation so possibly i will also sound louder than you okay since you refuse to lean in i'm fine it's good okay and also i talked to the wall so deal with it it's fine i'll get used to it but all right my point is that i uh have been like obsessed with oscars since i was very young and um i've always sort of you know you're led to as a as a youthful uh child who doesn't know anything to believe that yes indeed these are awards given to the person or you know people who deserve the thing the most and then later you sort of realize well there's a lot that goes into this award that's not just you know this is an actually deserving award not that it doesn't happen there are times when it does um probably 1999 is what taught me this when shakespeare and love won everything over elizabeth right my grudge against goop forever and ever yeah no that's still still mad about that one yeah no they're the oscars they're the pinnacle of film awards they still are and i'm sure they still are to the people who win them so my uh the the reason that i personally am okay with this year is that unlike previous years when there's just movies that just don't deserve this accolade this year at least there were a lot of the leading two i would say nominees certainly one of them uh really does deserve all these awards that they're nominated for and i'm absolutely talking about mad max fury road and that is honestly the reason why i'm very much okay with this yeah because that is a movie that just like you see it and you're awed by the power that is filmmaking yeah no it's like we've talked at length yeah and i mean i also then the fact that the revenant is nominated for a lot i mean you know we i don't know at some point probably we'll discuss it well we can mention it you can mention it you hated it i mean that's a stretch it's a stretch okay like i appreciate it for what it is and i like in your e2 and all that stuff like i just there were a lot of issues that i had with it that are like kind of like basic being like i don't care about the character yeah i mean like you know his ghost wife oh my gosh you know spoilers but it's not a spoiler um and it was it was very very beautiful i'm not gonna begrudge it that the thing is like the filmmaking aspect of it is also nominated a bunch which is the same with mad max like these movies are leading in all of the technical awards and the only reason why uh revenant beat mad max is because they also got the acting ones which is bs because charlie's absolutely should have been now that you've seen it why the shoot was arduous yeah but i mean like how i don't know i'm excited for him to to win i just like it's definitely seen him do better like all he did was like grunt around i honestly feel like he was definitely better in previous years in previous attempts uh to win an oscar this was not i mean he survived the shoot which is props to him but at the same time it was like there was no character there was nothing um and like i don't know he we called him the equivalent of sandra bullock in gravity but but yeah i mean she didn't win so he shouldn't either i mean but i like that character a little bit more of course we think that the revenant would be best if it was sandra bullock instead of leo in the wilderness fighting a bear you know had a comment that was more interest what was interesting that like leonardo's character he was his name hugh glass george glass george glass he was like hugh glass or something george glass no um sure jane he was such an expert yeah that like you didn't i you don't have any you know he's gonna get to the people and it's a revenge movie and stuff but like sandra bullock comparatively you were really like non-stop concerned yeah so like i was never like concerned for him in the wilderness i guess i don't know i wasn't whatever um really long no not a lot of tension just yeah it was 35 minutes it definitely could have been better and definitely could have been trimmed um and definitely could have had better i don't know he is just not a good character watch it win it will it probably will win but if it does i honestly need george miller to win best director i need this year to split i need it to be best picture revenant best director george miller yeah because they can't reward i mean they gotta give they gotta give something i mean they like nominated all over the place i mean it's definitely gonna win the technical anyway i was thinking i was ranting before which is absurd that why is charlie's not nominated like why why how did their actors get you know lost in this whole thing i don't know because it's you know she yeah well anyway the main reason the main bad thing about about these awards nominations is that a certain movie was very much left out of best picture even though best picture can have 10 awards yeah where it had eight this year yeah it has eight it's been it had eight last year for the last two years i think it will until they say no to eight and give well before the before last year it had nine oh it did it was like the first year had 10 the first year they expanded it had 10 and then maybe the second year it had 10 i don't remember yeah but then up until last year it was like nine oh and then last year there was eight and then this year there's eight so i mean if you can have 10 they're weird math i don't understand why cal is not here it is really or create for that matter really absurd yeah honestly those two movies should be there yeah and also you know michael b jordan should be yeah in the actor race 100 i don't know i don't i probably like you can leave out coogler like he doesn't need to be there who the director of creed but oh oh i thought you're talking about best actor still no no no but michael b jordan definitely should have been because like i don't know it's just it's it's it's weird like he was as as much there as the other one i don't know like i think the director could be in there who would you take out though i don't know big short guy or room guy well don't forget that you're adding todd haynes oh yeah both of those can go because room was about the performances it is true that this is the first time i feel like he was nominated yeah he doesn't get nominated yeah i mean i give him props for and also brie larson directed the child as we now know right so really he just made that tiny space work yeah i don't know yeah so i would there you go i got them both in there okay that would be perfect then i really would um so yeah carol not nominated no it's not and neither is todd hayden's like yeah please let us start the hashtag justice for carol movie because what in the f i know like i i don't know as much as the revenant and um mad max are about celebrating what it means to create a beautiful piece of cinema and like a whoa our do a shoot we're doing something with movies blah blah this carol i mean it is a piece of art it's a masterpiece yeah it's a masterpiece i will say it it is it is absolutely a piece of art and it should a hundred percent be there what would martin scorsese say about this like he would be he's probably like jizzing himself over it because he loves movies and this was a masterpiece movie yeah carol is phenomenal it is so yeah what did you make of you read um and we can link to richard lawson's yeah i can't remember the exact title of the article that he wrote about why carol might not have been nominated all i remember is that his tweet was called carol complaining and i know that was not the name of the article um he also had the best line ever best expression about uh the missing a nomination for carol is what the harge happened and what did the harge happen so i thought it was a great article because it it was written real fast right after the uh nominees and it was honestly like a guy's uh true feelings i mean he this is a he's a gay man and he was really um looking forward to this movie for years i think and um sort of had like an you know a little bit of a reaction after it came out but now definitely turned to accept it and love it i definitely feel like that was one of those things where like when you see something for the first time and you're like it's not like in my head yeah exactly but then you like yeah yeah i mean we also had sort of like that i mean we had our issues with that i mean it's so meticulous as a piece of filmmaking yeah that i think that you need to see it multiple times yeah oh it is a absolutely i mean again sometimes movies come out and i go sometimes i wish i was back in school so i could write papers about this because yeah i mean all these little film kids will be writing about it maybe right so anyway what was your reaction to his complaints i liked all his reasons they all seemed like i and i mean i hate that this is like a conception of the movie but that like the idea that people find it cold and well he said was carol too gay for the well that was another reason that was a separate reason which i was gonna do next like the first one is that like people find the love story like cold that like or distancing that was what critics uh in certain reviews kind of use those keywords cold that's because they're not paying attention i think that's because they're i mean i'm gonna be blunt about it i think that's because they're men and they sit there going why isn't like why isn't she liking this stand-in for us i don't understand why k blanchett would choose to be with a woman and not me yeah right um you know i think that ties into the just general misogyny of like award shows like this where men's stories are favored over women's there are three out of eight movies that are about women i think brooklyn mad max and room are the three um but like that could definitely be a factor for sure i i i really feel like it was hard for them to i mean it's hard for again if you take carol and you just make the same movie but about a heterosexual couple they would love it", "segments": [{"start": 0.48, "end":

there's a painter guy out right in front of our apartment yeah and he could at any moment start maybe singing or we came in coughing or scraping we're in a different we're in a different situation so possibly i will also sound louder than you okay since you refuse to lean in i'm fine it's good okay and also i talked to the wall so deal with it it's fine i'll get used to it but all right my point is that i uh have been like obsessed with oscars since i was very young and um i've always sort of you know you're led to as a as a youthful uh child who doesn't know anything to believe that yes indeed these are awards given to the person or you know people who deserve the thing the most and then later you sort of realize well there's a lot that goes into this award that's not just you know this is an actually deserving award not that it doesn't happen there are times when it does um probably 1999 is what taught me this when shakespeare and love won everything over elizabeth right my grudge against goop forever and ever yeah no that's still still mad about that one yeah no they're the oscars they're the pinnacle of film awards they still are and i'm sure they still are to the people who win them so my uh the the reason that i personally am okay with this year is that unlike previous years when there's just movies that just don't deserve this accolade this year at least there were a lot of the leading two i would say nominees certainly one of them uh really does deserve all these awards that they're nominated for and i'm absolutely talking about mad max fury road and that is honestly the reason why i'm very much okay with this yeah because that is a movie that just like you see it and you're awed by the power that is filmmaking yeah no it's like we've talked at length yeah and i mean i also then the fact that the revenant is nominated for a lot i mean you know we i don't know at some point probably we'll discuss it well we can mention it you can mention it you hated it i mean that's a stretch it's a stretch okay like i appreciate it for what it is and i like in your e2 and all that stuff like i just there were a lot of issues that i had with it that are like kind of like basic being like i don't care about the character yeah i mean like you know his ghost wife oh my gosh you know spoilers but it's not a spoiler um and it was it was very very beautiful i'm not gonna begrudge it that the thing is like the filmmaking aspect of it is also nominated a bunch which is the same with mad max like these movies are leading in all of the technical awards and the only reason why uh revenant beat mad max is because they also got the acting ones which is bs because charlie's absolutely should have been now that you've seen it why the shoot was arduous yeah but i mean like how i don't know i'm excited for him to to win i just like it's definitely seen him do better like all he did was like grunt around i honestly feel like he was definitely better in previous years in previous attempts uh to win an oscar this was not i mean he survived the shoot which is props to him but at the same time it was like there was no character there was nothing um and like i don't know he we called him the equivalent of sandra bullock in gravity but but yeah i mean she didn't win so he shouldn't either i mean but i like that character a little bit more of course we think that the revenant would be best if it was sandra bullock instead of leo in the wilderness fighting a bear you know had a comment that was more interest what was interesting that like leonardo's character he was his name hugh glass george glass george glass he was like hugh glass or something george glass no um sure jane he was such an expert yeah that like you didn't i you don't have any you know he's gonna get to the people and it's a revenge movie and stuff but like sandra bullock comparatively you were really like non-stop concerned yeah so like i was never like concerned for him in the wilderness i guess i don't know i wasn't whatever um really long no not a lot of tension just yeah it was 35 minutes it definitely could have been better and definitely could have been trimmed um and definitely could have had better i don't know he is just not a good character watch it win it will it probably will win but if it does i honestly need george miller to win best director i need this year to split i need it to be best picture revenant best director george miller yeah because they can't reward i mean they gotta give they gotta give something i mean they like nominated all over the place i mean it's definitely gonna win the technical anyway i was thinking i was ranting before which is absurd that why is charlie's not nominated like why why how did their actors get you know lost in this whole thing i don't know because it's you know she yeah well anyway the main reason the main bad thing about about these awards nominations is that a certain movie was very much left out of best picture even though best picture can have 10 awards yeah where it had eight this year yeah it has eight it's been it had eight last year for the last two years i think it will until they say no to eight and give well before the before last year it had nine oh it did it was like the first year had 10 the first year they expanded it had 10 and then maybe the second year it had 10 i don't remember yeah but then up until last year it was like nine oh and then last year there was eight and then this year there's eight so i mean if you can have 10 they're weird math i don't understand why cal is not here it is really or create for that matter really absurd yeah honestly those two movies should be there yeah and also you know michael b jordan should be yeah in the actor race 100 i don't know i don't i probably like you can leave out coogler like he doesn't need to be there who the director of creed but oh oh i thought you're talking about best actor still no no no but michael b jordan definitely should have been because like i don't know it's just it's it's it's weird like he was as as much there as the other one i don't know like i think the director could be in there who would you take out though i don't know big short guy or room guy well don't forget that you're adding todd haynes oh yeah both of those can go because room was about the performances it is true that this is the first time i feel like he was nominated yeah he doesn't get nominated yeah i mean i give him props for and also brie larson directed the child as we now know right so really he just made that tiny space work yeah i don't know yeah so i would there you go i got them both in there okay that would be perfect then i really would um so yeah carol not nominated no it's not and neither is todd hayden's like yeah please let us start the hashtag justice for carol movie because what in the f i know like i i don't know as much as the revenant and um mad max are about celebrating what it means to create a beautiful piece of cinema and like a whoa our do a shoot we're doing something with movies blah blah this carol i mean it is a piece of art it's a masterpiece yeah it's a masterpiece i will say it it is it is absolutely a piece of art and it should a hundred percent be there what would martin scorsese say about this like he would be he's probably like jizzing himself over it because he loves movies and this was a masterpiece movie yeah carol is phenomenal it is so yeah what did you make of you read um and we can link to richard lawson's yeah i can't remember the exact title of the article that he wrote about why carol might not have been nominated all i remember is that his tweet was called carol complaining and i know that was not the name of the article um he also had the best line ever best expression about uh the missing a nomination for carol is what the harge happened and what did the harge happen so i thought it was a great article because it it was written real fast right after the uh nominees and it was honestly like a guy's uh true feelings i mean he this is a he's a gay man and he was really um looking forward to this movie for years i think and um sort of had like an you know a little bit of a reaction after it came out but now definitely turned to accept it and love it i definitely feel like that was one of those things where like when you see something for the first time and you're like it's not like in my head yeah exactly but then you like yeah yeah i mean we also had sort of like that i mean we had our issues with that i mean it's so meticulous as a piece of filmmaking yeah that i think that you need to see it multiple times yeah oh it is a absolutely i mean again sometimes movies come out and i go sometimes i wish i was back in school so i could write papers about this because yeah i mean all these little film kids will be writing about it maybe right so anyway what was your reaction to his complaints i liked all his reasons they all seemed like i and i mean i hate that this is like a conception of the movie but that like the idea that people find it cold and well he said was carol too gay for the well that was another reason that was a separate reason which i was gonna do next like the first one is that like people find the love story like cold that like or distancing that was what critics uh in certain reviews kind of use those keywords cold that's because they're not paying attention i think that's because they're i mean i'm gonna be blunt about it i think that's because they're men and they sit there going why isn't like why isn't she liking this stand-in for us i don't understand why k blanchett would choose to be with a woman and not me yeah right um you know i think that ties into the just general misogyny of like award shows like this where men's stories are favored over women's there are three out of eight movies that are about women i think brooklyn mad max and room are the three um but like that could definitely be a factor for sure i i i really feel like it was hard for them to i mean it's hard for again if you take carol and you just make the same movie but about a heterosexual couple they would love it", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.48, "end": 8.48, "text": " you're just talking to the wall yes it was funny i don't know why
