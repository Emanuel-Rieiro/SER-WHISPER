{"text": " This is David Unsworth, host of the Pan Am Post English podcast. Donald Trump has routinely been portrayed by the mainstream media as a xenophobic, anti-immigrant president, aghast at the prospect of an increasingly diverse nation. Former White House Green Job Czar Van Jones famously declared on election night that Trump's victory was a white lash against a changing America. Trump has ruffled the feathers of leftists with his call for a wall on the Mexican border and a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries. But how radical is Trump's agenda on immigration? Is Trump racist and anti-immigrant? How do his policies differ from the Obama administration's? What should a comprehensive immigration reform bill look like? Is there any hope of uniting a nation divided in a way that we have not seen in generations? Trump is in a position where the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have little room for compromise when it comes to immigration. Several years back, there was a bipartisan group in the Senate called the Gang of Eight that tried to seek out some kind of middle ground. What I'm going to talk about today is something that I think that all Americans should fundamentally support, which is the notion that if someone is in the country illegally and has or is committing crimes, that they should not be allowed to stay in the United States. I mean, even if you are coming from a very left-wing perspective, even if you're a hardcore Democrat or liberal, I think we can all agree on that. If you are already in the country illegally and for whatever reason you have been allowed to stay and you are committing crimes, I don't believe anyone could make a reasonable case that you should be allowed to stay in the United States. Now, there's a very interesting article in Russia Today about Emmanuel Macron in France and his new proposal. He is significantly cracking down on illegal immigrants who commit crimes, and he says that he is going to deport them immediately. There was a case that got a lot of publicity at the Marseille train station. There was an individual who stabbed a woman, and he had recently, two days before the attack, been arrested for shoplifting, but he didn't have documentation, so he was allowed to, he was set free. I mean, this should not be happening. This should absolutely not be happening. In my home state of Massachusetts, there was a very pivotal legal challenge involving the state of Massachusetts versus the Trump administration and ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It involved a Cambodian by the name of Srinuwan Lung, and in this case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court basically ruled that the court officers, quote, and potentially all members of law enforcement do not have the authority to arrest someone at the request of federal immigration authorities pursuant to a civil immigration detainer. So, it raises an interesting question with regard to federalism. I mean, federalism has emerged, many times from civil war to gay marriage to federal enforcement of drug laws with many states legalizing marijuana. It's an interesting constitutional question, but for the state of Massachusetts to be protecting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, and rather than turn them over to ICE to release them back into the public, well, what could possibly go wrong, right? Well, a lot could possibly go wrong. It turns out that Lung and a friend robbed and assaulted an elderly woman in Charlestown, which is right across the Charles River to the north of Boston. They hit her in the head and stole $2,000 from her as she was leaving Bank of America. I mean, this is just astounding. I mean, as Boston radio host Howie Carr often says, you know, what could possibly go wrong, right? He's already in the country illegally. He's already committed crimes once. The state of Massachusetts refuses to turn him over to ICE for deportation, and now he's assaulted an elderly woman, and here is what is really infuriating to me, and even if you hate Trump, if you're a Democrat, if you're a liberal, I really don't see how you can be on the other side here. Here is the kicker. He's now being held on $2,500 bail. $2,500 bail for robbing and assaulting an elderly woman in a wheelchair when he's already in the country illegally? I mean, what on earth are we thinking? Many states have laws that include enhanced penalties for committing crimes against the elderly, although as libertarian, I have problems with those because I think we have equal protection under the law, but nonetheless, how on earth do you do something like this? And it's his, what, third offense or fourth offense? This is just crazy. What is really problematic in today's America, and what is in many ways responsible for putting Trump in the White House, is the reaction against just insane and almost perverse levels of political correctness. Fundamentally, there is no right for non-citizens to immigrate to the United States and stay here illegally, regardless of what the Democratic Party in the state of Massachusetts has been deluded into believing, and has deluded other people into believing. There's another case that has drawn the attention of the U.S. Senate, specifically Senator Charles Grassley, of Iowa, and Tom Tillis of North Carolina, have called for more oversight of DACA, the Dreamers legislation. It involves the case of Emmanuel Jesus Rangel Hernandez, who was arrested on drug charges, and slated to be deported, but his deportation was closed by a judge in North Carolina, and he was granted deferred action in late 2013. This is one of Obama's signature pieces of legislation, the Dreamers Act, which I have serious problems with. Well, Mr. Rangel Hernandez went on to commit a drug-related triple murder in North Carolina. Now, what's kind of the saddest thing of all about this is, coincidentally, one of his victims, former America's Next Top Model contestant Mirjana Puhar, was also an immigrant from Serbia. She had fled ethnic conflict there on the Serbian-Kosovo border. And that's something that isn't talked about much either. Immigrants themselves are often the victims of crimes committed by other illegal immigrants in the United States. So, Senator Tillis and Grassley have called for an investigation into the review and approval process for DACA applicants, and that seems entirely warranted. Fundamentally, the rule of law is what separates the United States from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes and anarchy. I've pointed this out dozens of times, but apparently to little avail with the never-Trumpers. Donald Trump is merely calling for the enforcement of existing immigration laws here. It would be one thing if Trump was saying, well, people that immigrated to the United States legally, we're going to revoke those green cards, or we're going to revoke those green cards, or we're going to revoke their citizenship, and we're going to round them up and deport them. No one's ever called for doing that. Trump is just saying, and here's what I really don't get. It's not as if Trump is saying, we want to round up all illegal immigrants in the United States. We often hear a figure cited of 11 million, some of the most largest estimates I've heard extend to as high as 30 million, regardless of what the number is. Trump has never said, we want every single illegal immigrant out of the United States. What he's trying to do now is to deport illegal immigrants in the United States who have committed crimes. I mean, that is exactly what he should be doing. How could you possibly argue with that? I mean, Americans of virtually all political stripes can agree that illegal immigrants who commit crimes on U.S. soil should not be in the United States. So Trump is absolutely correct to call for the immediate deportation, of illegal aliens who have committed crimes to their countries of origin. Now, here's the problem. There are several nations that do not cooperate on this front.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.28, "text": " This is David Unsworth,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [639, 307, 4389, 25017, 13136, 11],

Donald Trump has routinely been portrayed by the mainstream media as a xenophobic, anti-immigrant president, aghast at the prospect of an increasingly diverse nation. Former White House Green Job Czar Van Jones famously declared on election night that Trump's victory was a white lash against a changing America. Trump has ruffled the feathers of leftists with his call for a wall on the Mexican border and a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries. But how radical is Trump's agenda on immigration? Is Trump racist and anti-immigrant? How do his policies differ from the Obama administration's? What should a comprehensive immigration reform bill look like? Is there any hope of uniting a nation divided in a way that we have not seen in generations? Trump is in a position where the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have little room for compromise when it comes to immigration. Several years back, there was a bipartisan group in the Senate called the Gang of Eight that tried to seek out some kind of middle ground. What I'm going to talk about today is something that I think that all Americans should fundamentally support, which is the notion that if someone is in the country illegally and has or is committing crimes, that they should not be allowed to stay in the United States. I mean, even if you are coming from a very left-wing perspective, even if you're a hardcore Democrat or liberal, I think we can all agree on that. If you are already in the country illegally and for whatever reason you have been allowed to stay and you are committing crimes, I don't believe anyone could make a reasonable case that you should be allowed to stay in the United States. Now, there's a very interesting article in Russia Today about Emmanuel Macron in France and his new proposal. He is significantly cracking down on illegal immigrants who commit crimes, and he says that he is going to deport them immediately. There was a case that got a lot of publicity at the Marseille train station. There was an individual who stabbed a woman, and he had recently, two days before the attack, been arrested for shoplifting, but he didn't have documentation, so he was allowed to, he was set free. I mean, this should not be happening. This should absolutely not be happening. In my home state of Massachusetts, there was a very pivotal legal challenge involving the state of Massachusetts versus the Trump administration and ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It involved a Cambodian by the name of Srinuwan Lung, and in this case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court basically ruled that the court officers, quote, and potentially all members of law enforcement do not have the authority to arrest someone at the request of federal immigration authorities pursuant to a civil immigration detainer. So, it raises an interesting question with regard to federalism. I mean, federalism has emerged, many times from civil war to gay marriage to federal enforcement of drug laws with many states legalizing marijuana. It's an interesting constitutional question, but for the state of Massachusetts to be protecting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, and rather than turn them over to ICE to release them back into the public, well, what could possibly go wrong, right? Well, a lot could possibly go wrong. It turns out that Lung and a friend robbed and assaulted an elderly woman in Charlestown, which is right across the Charles River to the north of Boston. They hit her in the head and stole $2,000 from her as she was leaving Bank of America. I mean, this is just astounding. I mean, as Boston radio host Howie Carr often says, you know, what could possibly go wrong, right? He's already in the country illegally. He's already committed crimes once. The state of Massachusetts refuses to turn him over to ICE for deportation, and now he's assaulted an elderly woman, and here is what is really infuriating to me, and even if you hate Trump, if you're a Democrat, if you're a liberal, I really don't see how you can be on the other side here. Here is the kicker. He's now being held on $2,500 bail. $2,500 bail for robbing and assaulting an elderly woman in a wheelchair when he's already in the country illegally? I mean, what on earth are we thinking? Many states have laws that include enhanced penalties for committing crimes against the elderly, although as libertarian, I have problems with those because I think we have equal protection under the law, but nonetheless, how on earth do you do something like this? And it's his, what, third offense or fourth offense? This is just crazy. What is really problematic in today's America, and what is in many ways responsible for putting Trump in the White House, is the reaction against just insane and almost perverse levels of political correctness. Fundamentally, there is no right for non-citizens to immigrate to the United States and stay here illegally, regardless of what the Democratic Party in the state of Massachusetts has been deluded into believing, and has deluded other people into believing. There's another case that has drawn the attention of the U.S. Senate, specifically Senator Charles Grassley, of Iowa, and Tom Tillis of North Carolina, have called for more oversight of DACA, the Dreamers legislation. It involves the case of Emmanuel Jesus Rangel Hernandez, who was arrested on drug charges, and slated to be deported, but his deportation was closed by a judge in North Carolina, and he was granted deferred action in late 2013. This is one of Obama's signature pieces of legislation, the Dreamers Act, which I have serious problems with. Well, Mr. Rangel Hernandez went on to commit a drug-related triple murder in North Carolina. Now, what's kind of the saddest thing of all about this is, coincidentally, one of his victims, former America's Next Top Model contestant Mirjana Puhar, was also an immigrant from Serbia. She had fled ethnic conflict there on the Serbian-Kosovo border. And that's something that isn't talked about much either. Immigrants themselves are often the victims of crimes committed by other illegal immigrants in the United States. So, Senator Tillis and Grassley have called for an investigation into the review and approval process for DACA applicants, and that seems entirely warranted. Fundamentally, the rule of law is what separates the United States from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes and anarchy. I've pointed this out dozens of times, but apparently to little avail with the never-Trumpers. Donald Trump is merely calling for the enforcement of existing immigration laws here. It would be one thing if Trump was saying, well, people that immigrated to the United States legally, we're going to revoke those green cards, or we're going to revoke those green cards, or we're going to revoke their citizenship, and we're going to round them up and deport them. No one's ever called for doing that. Trump is just saying, and here's what I really don't get. It's not as if Trump is saying, we want to round up all illegal immigrants in the United States. We often hear a figure cited of 11 million, some of the most largest estimates I've heard extend to as high as 30 million, regardless of what the number is. Trump has never said, we want every single illegal immigrant out of the United States. What he's trying to do now is to deport illegal immigrants in the United States who have committed crimes. I mean, that is exactly what he should be doing. How could you possibly argue with that? I mean, Americans of virtually all political stripes can agree that illegal immigrants who commit crimes on U.S. soil should not be in the United States. So Trump is absolutely correct to call for the immediate deportation, of illegal aliens who have committed crimes to their countries of origin. Now, here's the problem.
