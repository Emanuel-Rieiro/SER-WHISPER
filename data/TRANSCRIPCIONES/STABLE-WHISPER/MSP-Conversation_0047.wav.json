{"text": " where he is attempting to merge technology with the flesh, where people have these garish wounds that are sort of fleshy. Well, in Existence, there's almost like a little port on people's bellies, I think. Spine and back. Oh, yeah, spine and back. Videodrome's front. Plug. And then, yes, in Videodrome, he sticks his hand in his stomach and pulls out a gun or puts a gun in his stomach. The videotape scene is especially my favorite. Yeah, and it's still great. It's great. But he kind of walks out. He doesn't seem concerned about the suspension of disbelief with the flesh. And it seems to me that I'm sure they try their best to do a great makeup job, but it always just looks like this putty on a person's face or putty on their back, their spine. And it just looks fake. And it seems to me that Cronenberg is saying, eh, I don't really care that you know this is fake. We're all in agreement that this is fiction and it's not real. I'm just kind of like positing this narrative that you can then sort of go with. And if you can't suspend your disbelief, then tough luck. Just, you know, we're... Anyway, I don't know. I've talked a long time, but... And I think that that might be the link, because there's links between Cronenberg's work, even films that seem completely unrelated to other ones. There's a thread that runs through his movies. Like you could say that, I mean, not all of them, but like you said, they deal with the flesh and they deal with both the beauty, the ghastliness, and the way that it's almost like our sin, but he's not that cheap. He doesn't go on levels that easily perceived. I think it's just these themes. My favorite filmmakers are filmmakers that have themes that consistently run through their work, through their entire, through the totality of their career. Well, I would say that most auteur filmmakers, let's say, that would be... Well, even like Steven Spielberg, you know, like how he's obsessed with like that, not obsessed, but how he has like the childlike sense of wonder and awe, how he just, that's a consistent motif, whether he's producing or directing. Sure. It's something, it's even in Men in Black, it has that, it has that ability to bring you back to being nine years old. Cronenberg has that ability to thoroughly, psychologically, and spiritually disgust, while also, you know, making you laugh at the same time, because it's so over the top. It's like one part, I can't remember if it's Rob Botten or Rob Botten, he uses those, those like, those, those flesh putty effects. He uses latex effects rather than going the route of like CGI. But there's, there's two scenes in, in History of Violence, which was the first film that I could remember there being like, like blatant CGI. Existence used more, more potent special effects than I could remember seeing in any film before, Cronenberg film before that. And it seems like he's pushing the line on himself while also remaining the same, he's still Cronenberg. And A Dangerous Method was a real far departure from what I think, because there's not a single horror aspect to the film. But the idea of horror, it was, it was really interesting. Anthony Mann, the film critic at, at the New Yorker wrote about this different kind of horror, about the horror of aging, and how Amour was a different kind of horror film. Because it was this film about watching this, this man, this woman who absolutely loved each other, and the dissolution of a relationship, and how just, you know, the look on his face as he was watching his wife crumble, was, was a totally new type of horror film that had never existed before. Well, let me just jump in and say, horror has become a genre, has become a genre probably, since, probably, I guess you could say, since the novels of, why am I? Lovecraft? Stoker? Poe. Poe. Edgar Allan Poe. I would guess that, you know, if you were to read up on it, but I'm sure, there's probably some, some things that precurs, pre, pre, that predate Edgar Allan Poe, and also we're talking about Western society. But genre, it became, it's become a codified genre. And so when we say horror, we mean this codified genre. And what you're, what you're suggesting, Gabe, is that Amour is another kind of horror, by saying Amour is another kind of horror, is a little bit like saying, I mean, I can't think of a great example, but let's say, it would be a little bit like, if taking, taking, transcendental meditation is a new kind of roller coaster. I mean, it's just such a different, I hear you, such a different experience, that it doesn't even, they're just, it doesn't, they don't have anything in common. Absolutely. Because then you could also say, Bowling for Columbine is another kind of horror. Yeah. The, any, you know, a documentary on the Holocaust is another kind of horror. Which it is. Yes, of course. Absolutely. Of course. The horror exists in many, many ways. But that the horror film genre. It doesn't have to be. Absolutely. There's no, it's a million miles away from being codified as a genre. The closest thing would be, you know, maybe something like the scene in The Shining, where the woman in the bathtub is all of a sudden aged, and it's horrifying. Or, or maybe, or maybe some, some David Lynch scenes where, you know, if David Lynch somehow introduced the horror of aging into his, into a film, then I could see it being being codified as part of the horror genre. And hold on, Gabe, because I got to say this. You must, you must. Yeah, yeah, because I, I have to. And were you done, Zav? Yeah. Okay, yeah. I just, I would say, I understand what you're saying about that, you know, with the, you talk about horror as a core, and then in the peripheral way of looking at it, you can draw so many other genres and things in that it's worthless to call them more a horror. But it is, it is a, potentially a slow horror. But again, we, you guys just covered it. So I want to, when you guys kept repeating the word horror, I had the great good fortune of going to see the author of horror speak, Adam Rockoff, and his new book is entitled The Horror of It All. And what, what, so this is an incredible coincidence. It is an immensely readable book on the horror genre, and he was just here in Milwaukee. And if you gentlemen will allow me to briefly explain Of course. Boswell Book Company, the great book company here in Milwaukee. It's a, like River West Radio, it's a, River West Film and Video. It's a vital cultural nexus of the community. My heart would break in a million pieces if, if this, when Zav was indicating a potential non-longevity, and I just, my, just not good. I'll put it that way. And then we have the radio station, purging and so on and so forth. And popcorn time. Well, no, I'm doing it. And I am just so happy and thankful on a daily basis that this, that River West Film and Video continues to thrive. And now that River West Radio is firmly entrenched in here because it would just be ripping, literally ripping out the heart of River West. And so Zav, a million, million heartfelt thanks. Not in just in a time of, oh my God, but when the times are decent, now, thank you so much for doing this because this would rip, the river would be like the horror. It would be. It's what, it's what Brando was talking about at the end of Apocalypse Now. Yeah. And it would be the horror. It would be. That's the horror. It would be like gravity all of a sudden just stopping dead in its track on earth and everything went haywire. Let's bring this back to media in a second where, for a second, because this is a media, this, if there's any tying thread between River West Radio and River West Film and Video, it's media. River West Radio is a media giant. It's a generating, content generating platform, let's say. And then River West Film and Video is a content distribution medium, platform. And so that's how, that's the two things they have in common. Otherwise, I mean, there's obviously music, sound, and audio, oral, lots of oral stimulation in a DVD, but it's mostly, mostly visual stimulation. And then River West Radio is, of course, an oral, experience. And there is a visual element. So, but those things are all merging. They're all collapsing together. I've said this many times that the difference between CBS News, the New York Times, and, oh wait, okay, CBS, the New York Times, National Public Radio, up until the 1980s, these were very distinct things. You went to National Public Radio to listen to the radio. You went to the New York Times to read your newspaper at the, in the morning or on your way to work on the subway and so on. And you tuned into CBS to watch the news, watch entertainment.", "segments": [{"start": 0.26, "end": 3.78, "text": " where he is attempting to merge", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [689, 415, 307, 22001,

the flesh, where people have these garish wounds that are sort of fleshy. Well, in Existence, there's almost like a little port on people's bellies, I think. Spine and back. Oh, yeah, spine and back. Videodrome's front. Plug. And then, yes, in Videodrome, he sticks his hand in his stomach and pulls out a gun or puts a gun in his stomach. The videotape scene is especially my favorite. Yeah, and it's still great. It's great. But he kind of walks out. He doesn't seem concerned about the suspension of disbelief with the flesh. And it seems to me that I'm sure they try their best to do a great makeup job, but it always just looks like this putty on a person's face or putty on their back, their spine. And it just looks fake. And it seems to me that Cronenberg is saying, eh, I don't really care that you know this is fake. We're all in agreement that this is fiction and it's not real. I'm just kind of like positing this narrative that you can then sort of go with. And if you can't suspend your disbelief, then tough luck. Just, you know, we're... Anyway, I don't know. I've talked a long time, but... And I think that that might be the link, because there's links between Cronenberg's work, even films that seem completely unrelated to other ones. There's a thread that runs through his movies. Like you could say that, I mean, not all of them, but like you said, they deal with the flesh and they deal with both the beauty, the ghastliness, and the way that it's almost like our sin, but he's not that cheap. He doesn't go on levels that easily perceived. I think it's just these themes. My favorite filmmakers are filmmakers that have themes that consistently run through their work, through their entire, through the totality of their career. Well, I would say that most auteur filmmakers, let's say, that would be... Well, even like Steven Spielberg, you know, like how he's obsessed with like that, not obsessed, but how he has like the childlike sense of wonder and awe, how he just, that's a consistent motif, whether he's producing or directing. Sure. It's something, it's even in Men in Black, it has that, it has that ability to bring you back to being nine years old. Cronenberg has that ability to thoroughly, psychologically, and spiritually disgust, while also, you know, making you laugh at the same time, because it's so over the top. It's like one part, I can't remember if it's Rob Botten or Rob Botten, he uses those, those like, those, those flesh putty effects. He uses latex effects rather than going the route of like CGI. But there's, there's two scenes in, in History of Violence, which was the first film that I could remember there being like, like blatant CGI. Existence used more, more potent special effects than I could remember seeing in any film before, Cronenberg film before that. And it seems like he's pushing the line on himself while also remaining the same, he's still Cronenberg. And A Dangerous Method was a real far departure from what I think, because there's not a single horror aspect to the film. But the idea of horror, it was, it was really interesting. Anthony Mann, the film critic at, at the New Yorker wrote about this different kind of horror, about the horror of aging, and how Amour was a different kind of horror film. Because it was this film about watching this, this man, this woman who absolutely loved each other, and the dissolution of a relationship, and how just, you know, the look on his face as he was watching his wife crumble, was, was a totally new type of horror film that had never existed before. Well, let me just jump in and say, horror has become a genre, has become a genre probably, since, probably, I guess you could say, since the novels of, why am I? Lovecraft? Stoker? Poe. Poe. Edgar Allan Poe. I would guess that, you know, if you were to read up on it, but I'm sure, there's probably some, some things that precurs, pre, pre, that predate Edgar Allan Poe, and also we're talking about Western society. But genre, it became, it's become a codified genre. And so when we say horror, we mean this codified genre. And what you're, what you're suggesting, Gabe, is that Amour is another kind of horror, by saying Amour is another kind of horror, is a little bit like saying, I mean, I can't think of a great example, but let's say, it would be a little bit like, if taking, taking, transcendental meditation is a new kind of roller coaster. I mean, it's just such a different, I hear you, such a different experience, that it doesn't even, they're just, it doesn't, they don't have anything in common. Absolutely. Because then you could also say, Bowling for Columbine is another kind of horror. Yeah. The, any, you know, a documentary on the Holocaust is another kind of horror. Which it is. Yes, of course. Absolutely. Of course. The horror exists in many, many ways. But that the horror film genre. It doesn't have to be. Absolutely. There's no, it's a million miles away from being codified as a genre. The closest thing would be, you know, maybe something like the scene in The Shining, where the woman in the bathtub is all of a sudden aged, and it's horrifying. Or, or maybe, or maybe some, some David Lynch scenes where, you know, if David Lynch somehow introduced the horror of aging into his, into a film, then I could see it being being codified as part of the horror genre. And hold on, Gabe, because I got to say this. You must, you must. Yeah, yeah, because I, I have to. And were you done, Zav? Yeah. Okay, yeah. I just, I would say, I understand what you're saying about that, you know, with the, you talk about horror as a core, and then in the peripheral way of looking at it, you can draw so many other genres and things in that it's worthless to call them more a horror. But it is, it is a, potentially a slow horror. But again, we, you guys just covered it. So I want to, when you guys kept repeating the word horror, I had the great good fortune of going to see the author of horror speak, Adam Rockoff, and his new book is entitled The Horror of It All. And what, what, so this is an incredible coincidence. It is an immensely readable book on the horror genre, and he was just here in Milwaukee. And if you gentlemen will allow me to briefly explain Of course. Boswell Book Company, the great book company here in Milwaukee. It's a, like River West Radio, it's a, River West Film and Video. It's a vital cultural nexus of the community. My heart would break in a million pieces if, if this, when Zav was indicating a potential non-longevity, and I just, my, just not good. I'll put it that way. And then we have the radio station, purging and so on and so forth. And popcorn time. Well, no, I'm doing it. And I am just so happy and thankful on a daily basis that this, that River West Film and Video continues to thrive. And now that River West Radio is firmly entrenched in here because it would just be ripping, literally ripping out the heart of River West. And so Zav, a million, million heartfelt thanks. Not in just in a time of, oh my God, but when the times are decent, now, thank you so much for doing this because this would rip, the river would be like the horror. It would be. It's what, it's what Brando was talking about at the end of Apocalypse Now. Yeah. And it would be the horror. It would be. That's the horror. It would be like gravity all of a sudden just stopping dead in its track on earth and everything went haywire. Let's bring this back to media in a second where, for a second, because this is a media, this, if there's any tying thread between River West Radio and River West Film and Video, it's media. River West Radio is a media giant. It's a generating, content generating platform, let's say. And then River West Film and Video is a content distribution medium, platform. And so that's how, that's the two things they have in common. Otherwise, I mean, there's obviously music, sound, and audio, oral, lots of oral stimulation in a DVD, but it's mostly, mostly visual stimulation. And then River West Radio is, of course, an oral, experience. And there is a visual element. So, but those things are all merging. They're all collapsing together. I've said this many times that the difference between CBS News, the New York Times, and, oh wait, okay, CBS, the New York Times, National Public Radio, up until the 1980s, these were very distinct things. You went to National Public Radio to listen to the radio. You went to the New York Times to read your newspaper at the, in the morning or on your way to work on the subway and so on. And you tuned into CBS to watch the news, watch entertainment.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.26, "end": 7.18, "text": " where he is attempting to merge technology with the flesh,", "seek": 0.0,
