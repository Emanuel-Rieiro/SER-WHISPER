{"text": " Hi everyone, Brian Farrell here, and welcome to We Are Many, a show about people working for change and how that work changes them in the process. As always, this podcast is brought to you by WagingNonViolence.org. Let's get started. As longtime supporters of the fossil fuel industry and political candidates that deny global warming, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was perhaps the last group anyone would have expected to reverse its stance on climate change legislation. But that's exactly what it did, or so it appeared at least, during a press conference held at the National Press Club in 2009. Here's Chamber spokesperson Hingo Sembra disavowing the group's stance on the notoriously false climate solution known as clean coal. And that clean coal is a technology that has not only not been proven, it basically doesn't exist. And it's just obvious we have to put our money, it's a sane business decision, we have to put our money where the proof is. Okay, this is, I'm Eric Wohlschlegel, I'm with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is not an official U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, so I don't know what pretense is here. I know some of you in the press world, but this is a fraudulent press activity and a stunt. Who are you really, sir? So, if you have any questions, you're welcome to direct them to me with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Who are you really, sir? And do you have a business card? Are you with the U.S. Chamber? I do. We can discuss afterwards. Okay. Can I see your business card? Can I see yours? Are you here representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce? Yes, I am. Okay, well I work there and you do not look familiar to me at all. Could I see your business card? Could I see your business card? Yes, I am. This guy does not represent the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Can we finish the interview? No. This is not an official Chamber of Commerce. This is not... I'm on deadline. Yeah, got it. So, they're misrepresenting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Sir, if you want to have a... If anyone has any questions and wants to talk to the real Chamber of Commerce, they can direct, you can direct your questions to me. So, are you an activist? What's your position? If you would like to have a press conference, you can have your own press conference, sir. What is your position? You can't come in here and barge in and interrupt our press conference. What is your position? I don't know what... Sorry? What is your position at the Chamber of Commerce? I just spoke my position. What is your title? Your official title at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce? I'm the assistant to Mr. Donahue. Okay. This guy is a fraud. He's lying. This is, you know, a stunt that I've never seen before. Yes, in fact, it was a hoax. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's biggest pro-business lobby group, was a fraud for the fossil fuel industry. But that didn't stop it from becoming news. Reuters, Fox Business, CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, they all reported on the stunt. Some were fooled by it. Others were amused. In the end, though, the incident brought more attention to the Chamber's stance on climate change than just about any protest or environmental report ever had. But that wasn't the end of the story. The Chamber, apparently not yet realizing its image problem, decided to sue for copyright infringement. The defendant in that case, which would later be dropped, was the activist duo known as the Yes Men. Using various names, but principally Andy Bickelbaum and Mike Bonanno, the Yes Men have been shaming corporate wrongdoers with elaborate hoaxes for over 15 years and making movies about it. Their latest film, The Yes Men Are Revolting, is going to be available digitally on June 9th before opening in New York City on June 12th. Recently, I had a chance to speak with Andy Bickelbaum, a man you just heard posing as a U.S. Chamber representative with the rather unlikely name of Hingo Sembra. We talked about his new film and how his mischievous youth from a high school prank gone awry to getting fired from a computer programming job led, ultimately and unwittingly, to a career of hilarious but highly effective activism. Before getting into that, though, Andy would have to endure my own attempt at some humor. I'm going to begin. I wrote a really lame joke to start this off. Oh, good. I'm kind of embarrassed. All right. I'll just start. All right. I'm here with NSA cultural liaison Jude Finisterra. Hey. How you doing? Wait a minute. What? Is this a prank? I'm sorry. That was a terrible way to start this off. I just felt like this pressure to like come in with a joke. It's so hard to think of jokes. I'm a terrible joke writer. Really? Yeah. Kind of unnatural. Well, I'm good at like on the spot, like doing something funny when the cameras are on and everything, but like actually thinking through like, how do you tell a joke? Yeah. God, I don't know if you've ever known how that's... Yeah. I think the more thought you put into it, the worse it comes out. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Sort of like this one, how I put a lot of thought into it and it didn't really work at all. That's really familiar. A lot of the actions that I've been involved in, the more thought I put into them, the worse they were. Not always. But yeah, there is a correlation. Well, I'll start it off correct then. I am here with Andy Bickelbaum of the Yes Men, but that also is just one of your names that you go by. And I wanted to start off actually asking how you come up with all the different names that you do use in the actions. Like, I think they are amazingly hilarious yet believable because they're just so out there. Jude Finisterra. Or Renee Oswin and Hingo Sembrow. Like, is it just like off the cuff or what are you thinking when you come up with those? Yeah. Some of them are off the cuff. Some of them just come out of the blue. Some of them, I mean, one thing we do is search for Catholic saint names because there's a lot of them and they're really odd. There's a lot of really odd ones. Like there's patron saints of the impossible, like St. Jude, which is why the guy who announced the... You know, Bhopal action by Dow was named Jude Finisterra. Finisterra meant the end of the earth. Wow. There's... Yeah. Some of them are just obvious, like Shepard Wolf for the Halliburton guy. Do you have a favorite one that you've used over the years? Probably Granwith Huletberry. I love that one. I wrote that one down too and I actually was going to say it, but realized I didn't know how to say it. Yeah. Granwith Huletberry. What's that? I still have zero idea. I don't know how any of it makes any sense. There is no name Granwith, although it sounded perfect. Like that's obviously a Welsh name, but there is no such thing or Huletberry. It's kind of amazing. Well, so the Yes Men have a new movie coming out in June. Yeah. And it's called The Yes Men Are Revolting. Yep. And it has... I just watched it and loved it. It has everything I love about you guys in it. The creativity and the humor and the mischief. And all that stuff. But the thing that stood out to me as really new this time was how you guys actually kind of got into the personal side of what you do. Obviously that was an intentional decision, maybe in the editing process, but did you think about that going into it? Yeah. The whole idea from the going into it. I mean, the idea for this film came during Occupy, basically. And we thought it would be really important to highlight just how powerful this movement really was. We really wanted to talk about what was happening to us as people during Occupy and how that fits into a bigger picture of activism. And what was happening to us during Occupy was we were getting this huge breath of fresh air. We felt like, oh my God, so much is possible. You know, just a few people show up and camp out in this spot and boom, it turns into this crazy thing that changes the way we talk about inequality in this country. Or actually, it makes us able to talk about inequality in the media. Massive change. And we've seen it keep going in different forms and transform itself and infuse other movements with energy. So at the time, it was pretty obvious that was the thing to talk about. And especially we wanted to talk about how it had given us new hope and really made us see the power of activism overall. And it also showed us the power of our own activism. Because, you know, often over the years after doing these things, you've kind of like lost hope or thought that, you know, this action didn't do anything. You know, we'll do things and they finish and then nothing really seems to change. But at Occupy, a lot of people came up to us and said, you know, I got my start in activism by watching your first movie or your second movie. And that made us think about just how important it is to keep doing things, even if you don't know that, how they're succeeding or if they're succeeding, because it gets into the culture and people, it changes things in one way or another. And it's going to, that energy will take a new shape and a new form. In this case, Occupy, it was a little part of that, you know, mysteriously. I mean, not a big part, obviously, but that was a tremendous feeling to have. And we wanted to communicate that feeling of being part of a movement to a larger number of people. And so we had to tell a personal story because that is such a personal story. And, you know, so we had to tell the story of feeling despair and feeling hopeless and feeling like nothing is really working. And then realizing, oh, it has been working. We just didn't see how. It's actually been in the air in one way or another. And that's worth it.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 3.16, "text": " Hi everyone, Brian Farrell here, and welcome to We Are Many,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [2421, 1518, 11, 10765, 9067, 19771,

people working for change and how that work changes them in the process. As always, this podcast is brought to you by WagingNonViolence.org. Let's get started. As longtime supporters of the fossil fuel industry and political candidates that deny global warming, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was perhaps the last group anyone would have expected to reverse its stance on climate change legislation. But that's exactly what it did, or so it appeared at least, during a press conference held at the National Press Club in 2009. Here's Chamber spokesperson Hingo Sembra disavowing the group's stance on the notoriously false climate solution known as clean coal. And that clean coal is a technology that has not only not been proven, it basically doesn't exist. And it's just obvious we have to put our money, it's a sane business decision, we have to put our money where the proof is. Okay, this is, I'm Eric Wohlschlegel, I'm with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is not an official U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, so I don't know what pretense is here. I know some of you in the press world, but this is a fraudulent press activity and a stunt. Who are you really, sir? So, if you have any questions, you're welcome to direct them to me with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Who are you really, sir? And do you have a business card? Are you with the U.S. Chamber? I do. We can discuss afterwards. Okay. Can I see your business card? Can I see yours? Are you here representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce? Yes, I am. Okay, well I work there and you do not look familiar to me at all. Could I see your business card? Could I see your business card? Yes, I am. This guy does not represent the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Can we finish the interview? No. This is not an official Chamber of Commerce. This is not... I'm on deadline. Yeah, got it. So, they're misrepresenting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Sir, if you want to have a... If anyone has any questions and wants to talk to the real Chamber of Commerce, they can direct, you can direct your questions to me. So, are you an activist? What's your position? If you would like to have a press conference, you can have your own press conference, sir. What is your position? You can't come in here and barge in and interrupt our press conference. What is your position? I don't know what... Sorry? What is your position at the Chamber of Commerce? I just spoke my position. What is your title? Your official title at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce? I'm the assistant to Mr. Donahue. Okay. This guy is a fraud. He's lying. This is, you know, a stunt that I've never seen before. Yes, in fact, it was a hoax. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's biggest pro-business lobby group, was a fraud for the fossil fuel industry. But that didn't stop it from becoming news. Reuters, Fox Business, CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, they all reported on the stunt. Some were fooled by it. Others were amused. In the end, though, the incident brought more attention to the Chamber's stance on climate change than just about any protest or environmental report ever had. But that wasn't the end of the story. The Chamber, apparently not yet realizing its image problem, decided to sue for copyright infringement. The defendant in that case, which would later be dropped, was the activist duo known as the Yes Men. Using various names, but principally Andy Bickelbaum and Mike Bonanno, the Yes Men have been shaming corporate wrongdoers with elaborate hoaxes for over 15 years and making movies about it. Their latest film, The Yes Men Are Revolting, is going to be available digitally on June 9th before opening in New York City on June 12th. Recently, I had a chance to speak with Andy Bickelbaum, a man you just heard posing as a U.S. Chamber representative with the rather unlikely name of Hingo Sembra. We talked about his new film and how his mischievous youth from a high school prank gone awry to getting fired from a computer programming job led, ultimately and unwittingly, to a career of hilarious but highly effective activism. Before getting into that, though, Andy would have to endure my own attempt at some humor. I'm going to begin. I wrote a really lame joke to start this off. Oh, good. I'm kind of embarrassed. All right. I'll just start. All right. I'm here with NSA cultural liaison Jude Finisterra. Hey. How you doing? Wait a minute. What? Is this a prank? I'm sorry. That was a terrible way to start this off. I just felt like this pressure to like come in with a joke. It's so hard to think of jokes. I'm a terrible joke writer. Really? Yeah. Kind of unnatural. Well, I'm good at like on the spot, like doing something funny when the cameras are on and everything, but like actually thinking through like, how do you tell a joke? Yeah. God, I don't know if you've ever known how that's... Yeah. I think the more thought you put into it, the worse it comes out. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Sort of like this one, how I put a lot of thought into it and it didn't really work at all. That's really familiar. A lot of the actions that I've been involved in, the more thought I put into them, the worse they were. Not always. But yeah, there is a correlation. Well, I'll start it off correct then. I am here with Andy Bickelbaum of the Yes Men, but that also is just one of your names that you go by. And I wanted to start off actually asking how you come up with all the different names that you do use in the actions. Like, I think they are amazingly hilarious yet believable because they're just so out there. Jude Finisterra. Or Renee Oswin and Hingo Sembrow. Like, is it just like off the cuff or what are you thinking when you come up with those? Yeah. Some of them are off the cuff. Some of them just come out of the blue. Some of them, I mean, one thing we do is search for Catholic saint names because there's a lot of them and they're really odd. There's a lot of really odd ones. Like there's patron saints of the impossible, like St. Jude, which is why the guy who announced the... You know, Bhopal action by Dow was named Jude Finisterra. Finisterra meant the end of the earth. Wow. There's... Yeah. Some of them are just obvious, like Shepard Wolf for the Halliburton guy. Do you have a favorite one that you've used over the years? Probably Granwith Huletberry. I love that one. I wrote that one down too and I actually was going to say it, but realized I didn't know how to say it. Yeah. Granwith Huletberry. What's that? I still have zero idea. I don't know how any of it makes any sense. There is no name Granwith, although it sounded perfect. Like that's obviously a Welsh name, but there is no such thing or Huletberry. It's kind of amazing. Well, so the Yes Men have a new movie coming out in June. Yeah. And it's called The Yes Men Are Revolting. Yep. And it has... I just watched it and loved it. It has everything I love about you guys in it. The creativity and the humor and the mischief. And all that stuff. But the thing that stood out to me as really new this time was how you guys actually kind of got into the personal side of what you do. Obviously that was an intentional decision, maybe in the editing process, but did you think about that going into it? Yeah. The whole idea from the going into it. I mean, the idea for this film came during Occupy, basically. And we thought it would be really important to highlight just how powerful this movement really was. We really wanted to talk about what was happening to us as people during Occupy and how that fits into a bigger picture of activism. And what was happening to us during Occupy was we were getting this huge breath of fresh air. We felt like, oh my God, so much is possible. You know, just a few people show up and camp out in this spot and boom, it turns into this crazy thing that changes the way we talk about inequality in this country. Or actually, it makes us able to talk about inequality in the media. Massive change. And we've seen it keep going in different forms and transform itself and infuse other movements with energy. So at the time, it was pretty obvious that was the thing to talk about. And especially we wanted to talk about how it had given us new hope and really made us see the power of activism overall. And it also showed us the power of our own activism. Because, you know, often over the years after doing these things, you've kind of like lost hope or thought that, you know, this action didn't do anything. You know, we'll do things and they finish and then nothing really seems to change. But at Occupy, a lot of people came up to us and said, you know, I got my start in activism by watching your first movie or your second movie. And that made us think about just how important it is to keep doing things, even if you don't know that, how they're succeeding or if they're succeeding, because it gets into the culture and people, it changes things in one way or another. And it's going to, that energy will take a new shape and a new form. In this case, Occupy, it was a little part of that, you know, mysteriously. I mean, not a big part, obviously, but that was a tremendous feeling to have. And we wanted to communicate that feeling of being part of a movement to a larger number of people. And so we had to tell a personal story because that is such a personal story. And, you know, so we had to tell the story of feeling despair and feeling hopeless and feeling like nothing is really working. And then realizing, oh, it has been working. We just didn't see how. It's actually been in the air in one way or another. And that's worth it.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.04, "text": " Hi everyone, Brian Farrell here, and welcome to We Are Many, a show about people working", "seek": 0.0, "tokens":
