{"text": " When I walk by, I usually pick you up a bag of chips when I go shopping, something different or something spicy. Dad chips, as you like to call them. And when I saw this, the wrap was really what took me over. So they are gluten-free. Ingredients are potatoes, vegetable oil, corn, sugar, dehydrated vegetables, tomato, onion, garlic, salt, brown sugar, fructose, sodium, acetate, fancy molasses. Not just molasses, fancy. Fancy. Yeast extract, acidic acid, natural flavor, citric acid, high oleic sunflower oil, caramel color, spices, spice extracts. I'll have one. Get in there. It's like a bonus Test Market Thursday. I do like a ripple chip. Go ahead. You can bite it into the mic. People aren't going to crucify you for it. Can you taste the pulled pork? I guess you haven't tasted pulled pork in a long time, have you? It's got a very barbecue flavor to it. Yeah, it tastes like a rippled barbecue chip. It's good. It's not bad. Yeah, I can handle those. My favorite chip is a ripple all-dressed chip. I do like the Doritos too, but if you're going with a chip, ripple, like me, a Ruffles specifically, all-dressed. Well, we have got some chip-eaten scenarios coming up this week. We are going to be watching John Wick 2 because I'm going to see the opening of John Wick 3 this weekend with Keanu Reeves. Fantastic franchise. We are also going to check out the series finale of Big Bang Theory tonight. And of course, for those that don't know, we have that bet that we made yesterday on who was going to have the bigger audience for their series finale, or season finale, rather, series finale, Game of Thrones or Big Bang Theory. And our guesses are sealed. And the terms of the bet are if Candace loses, she has to get rid of her Jimmy Choo shoes that she's only worn twice in her entire life. And if I lose, I've got to get rid of boxes upon boxes upon boxes upon boxes of my DVDs that I've collected from over the years. It's a sad day. It's a sad day for both of us. Hey, you threw it down. Yeah, I know. You threw my shoes and, well, I'm throwing those random boxes from the back. So we got that and, of course, the season finale of series finale of Game of Thrones coming up on Sunday. Oh my gosh! I want to talk about it, but I know that all of our audience doesn't listen and I also know we have a spoiler-free that we talk about after each. Well, let's do, let's talk about this because there are some people online that are going crazy. They are so disappointed with the way season eight is going and the way some of their favorite characters are turning out that there is a petition online that is 35,000 signatures strong thus far asking for the writers to be fired from Game of Thrones, hire new ones, and completely redo season eight. Then those people should save their money and pay the salary of all the people that they want. These people do this because they were hired, because they were the best to do it, and this is the way that they wanted it executed. You are being entertained by these people and if you, 35,000 people, really want it all rewritten for your happy bow that you feel that it's supposed to be, because I'm sure all 35,000 of you really, really all agree that it should be the same way. And I'm sure you all do. And then what you should do is raise all that money and then you pay the salary of all the people that need to go ahead and make that execution for your work. I think it's funny. It's almost very childlike when you tell a child a story and they get so used to the story, whether it be a Christmas story or whatever it may be, and you decide to change a little bit and they go, no, no, no, tell it like you always, I want you to tell me a story, but I want you to tell it this way. Of course. Because people, they're so entitled. So entitled. It's entitlement. No, no, that's not the way I wanted the story to end. You've got to end it differently because my feelings are hurt. You're going to, do you remember, was it Black Mirror that had you could, you could pick the way the end of the show would work? Yeah, Bandersnatch. We reviewed that on Talking Movies with Brian Latake. It was very, it was a choose your own adventure style of storytelling, which they said they're going to be investing more money into because they were happy with the results of it. That's what I can see starting to happen after this Game of Thrones. Your next really big HBO show is going to have something similar happen to accommodate the feelings of people who feel that a paper cup was annoying, to see in a production or that they didn't like that. I don't want to give any spoilers, but they didn't like this and they didn't like that. And I've seen the memes. I think it's very silly. Well, remember, we heard the story about Jon Snow, Kit Harington. He got, he got married to one of the, his fellow cast members. And he had told her, because they have all signed NDAs, like they are sworn to secrecy. Like this one's buckled up as tight as Avengers Endgame was when it came to giving away spoilers for the show. And he told his wife the ending of what was going to happen as far as what he knew from the script. And didn't she, didn't he say that she didn't talk to him for two days? She was so angry. That's a rumor. Yeah. That I had read and online. I think it's come through, you know, to me many times. Yeah. Quite, quite upset about it. And she was probably upset based off the last episode. Well, and keep in mind, this is a story that is no stranger to killing off major characters, having twists and turns like television has never seen in a hundred years. My favorite that I've seen. Oh, I don't think I could say it. As far as predictions? No, as far as people being upset is that in the, in this episode, in this past episode. Careful now. No spoilers. Careful. Careful. A horse shows up. And people are upset that this horse shows up based off of what happens in the previous scene. And then yet they're not, because how could a horse just show up? And then you think, really? So the flying dragons, the white walkers. The mountain. These things were okay in your world, but the horse showing up was really what put you over the edge in this? This is what I mean. Really? Like you got, you got to get some hobbies. That's what these people need. Hobbies. Listen, if you're not happy with the way a story is told, then stop watching. Stop watching. Stop listening to the story. Yeah, or do, you know what's a really good idea? People always do those, they do it with Star Wars a lot because you show me them. They do these fan tributes where they say this. Fan films, yeah. Fan films. This is how I would have liked it to be, or could you imagine if this would have happened? Do that. Take that, those 35,000 people, pool your money together and do one of those. There's a great channel on YouTube called How It Should Have Ended, and it's very comedic, and they do it with a lot of superhero movies. And they, yeah, it's a very comedic take on how the movie probably should have, then their eyes should have ended to be much funnier. Yeah, I think it's great. Then go be a producer. Go be a lighting director. Go do all those things and do it yourself. I'll be honest with you, the reason why I watch movies and television shows is because I like the way it makes me feel. If it incites any kind of emotion in me, whether it be fear from watching a horror film, whether it be, you know, love from watching a romance movie or a comedic romance, or if you watch a comedy because you want to laugh, you're not watching Game of Thrones because you're looking for a happy ending. Yeah. That's not why you're watching the show. I know. I don't understand. They don't like the way certain characters have gone, and this scene... It's not your story. Your only job in this whole process is to watch, to be entertained. Right. And you are not even being, your entertainment isn't good enough for you. That's where we're at in society. Nope. No, this isn't good enough. I want to, I need to have a petition. I don't know how much you love petitions. Oh, sure, yeah. I'm actually looking at making a petition to stop petitions because I think petitions are stupid. They're ridiculous. Anyways, we have a very busy show. We will talk a little bit more entertainment. And you mentioned Black Mirror. I've got some news on that coming up in What's Trending Music News. You can use us on the way. We have some people guessing on what the newfie said on the Dave line yesterday. That's coming up a little bit later on. And Peepers responds to my question about him taking LSD. All that and more on a Thursday edition of We Learn in the Morning with Dave and Candice Ray. Busy right now. That is spring. Now that spring has sprung, he's got condos, he's got houses, he's got side-by-sides, he's got everything. If you are buying or selling property in Winnipeg or the surrounding area, check out mikemason.remax.ca. Get in touch with the guy We Learn in the Morning trusts with their real estate. Mike Mason of Remax. Click the link down in the pod script. This is a really tough story to read. This happened here in Winnipeg. A dog was beaten and stabbed three times and hate messages were spray-painted on the walls of a Winnipeg home after a break and enter. On Tuesday. When police arrived, they found the home that had been trashed and vandalized and the dog who also suffered from multiple wounds. They destroyed the inside of our house. The owner of the home wrote in a Facebook post that was accompanied by pictures of the aftermath. The photos show pictures that have been spray-painted over and over and one of the messages read die and the other messages read Paki lover die. The dog's family name is Petey and he was to the animal hospital where he is expected to survive. He was beat with a baseball bat and stabbed deeply three times with a butcher knife. Physically, he will survive. Mentally, that'll take time. We really don't know what the nature of the incident is at this time, says Constable Jay Murphy. Last month, Jewish cafe on Cordon was vandalized and hate messages were left on the walls. An investigation by Winnipeg police, however, led to allegations. That was fake. Yes. Yeah, it was fake. They ended up. Including the attack that left one of the owners injured was staged and charges against the owner of Beer Max Cafe. Yeah, so it's funny when that story came out, I didn't want to talk about it on the show, but I was chatting with a few friends about it and I said the worst part about that story is that when another story pops up where you see a possible hate crime happening, you're going to question it. And as soon as you started reading that, I kind of thought, hmm, I wonder if this is real, which is really too bad that my head even went there because that shit like that should be taken seriously. Desensitized. Yeah, totally. Right. And it's interesting. I thought when I read the article, I thought it was interesting that they also threw that back, an investigation and referring to an incident that happened last month, which was fake. So if it was fake and they know that it was fake, why bring it up now? Because that's how the media does things because they want you to go back and click on that. Oh, I didn't hear about that story. Well, then I guess I should as now somebody who reads this stuff, just not engage with it and not say anything until, you know, I'll be honest with you. I've been really disappointed with the way media has been going in the past five years. I mean, not even to touch on the whole Tommy Robinson situation, which is going on over in the UK, where here is a gentleman who was falsely imprisoned for 10 weeks in solitary confinement. They're they they are jailing journalists. This hasn't happened in 70 years. It's it's incredible just how the media the media is there. There's no more down the middle. Here's just the story. Everything's got to have a bias in it. Everything's got to have an angle on it. Everything's got to be, you know, supporting whatever the political agenda is for that company and where they stand politically. It's just it's it's really unfortunate. And again, it's a perfect example of somebody just saying, oh, yeah, but don't forget there is this fake one. So who knows? We'll do some investigating. But here's the story so far. Right. And if if this is true, which you would hope that not that I hope that it's true, but, you know, the media that, you know, that this isn't a false story, that there's not another person out there that's creating this. But you've you've really physically hurt a dog. Yeah. You know, and if that is where if that were to be fake, if you're going to go down that line, that's terrible. And that person should be prosecuted for that. And we shouldn't the media then shouldn't refer to it as a possible fake. Yeah, because it happened until the until all of a sudden, the story comes out. They've done the investigation three weeks from now. You know what? We can actually link this to this story together or not at all, because then, like you said, now you're reading it. And the first thing you thought of was, is this a fake story? Right. Is this somebody who set this up? Yeah, I it's getting harder and harder to read. I mean, it's funny. People always say, oh, Donald Trump, fake news. There is he's not wrong. There's a lot of fake news out there. And you can't just go on what you read anymore, because who knows what the person's agenda is behind it? There there's there's no more unbiased writing. Sad. Also, from what I know from analytics and SEO from companies, if you know how to work your analytics, and you can pay for your SEO, and you can pay for having your pages done properly with these big corporations, that's what makes you number one on these sites, you know, sometimes a new company will launch and all of a sudden, they're number one. You think, well, how did that happen? You have to have the right platform on the back end. That's why for us, it's taken us a long time to get safety net, even when you Google it on that first page, because I don't have the means to all these massive companies to like these news and media outlets to make them the first option that they have, or their sub companies also to have. Just to touch a little bit more on the whole Tommy Robinson thing. I won't get into details, but he was falsely imprisoned. The court ruled after 10 weeks of him being in prison said no, that that wasn't right. But now he decided to try and expose the this the things that we were talking about how biased media is and how biased governments are becoming. And he's trying to expose that. So he started he he's actually running for public office. He's running for one of the one of the seats in the European Union. And he's been banned off Facebook. He's been banned off Twitter. He's been banned off all social media because they're saying that he is a right wing racist. I have dug as deep as I could. I cannot find a single racist thing this man has done. He has protested radical Islam. He has protested I'll say that again. He has protested radical Islam, and has is very passionate about immigration laws in Britain in Great Britain. And because the general consensus is that that's, according to media is that that's racist. So he was go, Oh, he's racist, and he's gone. So now the courts are actually trying to retry him. They're trying to retry him on the exact same charge, which in North America is called double jeopardy. Yeah, I thought you weren't allowed. Yeah, it's called double jeopardy. And they're actually trying to hurt his campaign to sit. It kind of reminds me of that movie. Narcos where Pablo Escobar got voted in by the people in the government said, We don't care. You're not going to sit with us, which is not what government is government is elected officials. And I'm not saying Pablo Escobar should have been in there. But here's an example of a guy who had no criminal record prior to this from what I could find. And they're trying to keep him out of government. They're trying to keep him out of an elected official position.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.18, "text": " When I walk by,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [1133, 286, 1792, 538, 11], "temperature":

different or something spicy. Dad chips, as you like to call them. And when I saw this, the wrap was really what took me over. So they are gluten-free. Ingredients are potatoes, vegetable oil, corn, sugar, dehydrated vegetables, tomato, onion, garlic, salt, brown sugar, fructose, sodium, acetate, fancy molasses. Not just molasses, fancy. Fancy. Yeast extract, acidic acid, natural flavor, citric acid, high oleic sunflower oil, caramel color, spices, spice extracts. I'll have one. Get in there. It's like a bonus Test Market Thursday. I do like a ripple chip. Go ahead. You can bite it into the mic. People aren't going to crucify you for it. Can you taste the pulled pork? I guess you haven't tasted pulled pork in a long time, have you? It's got a very barbecue flavor to it. Yeah, it tastes like a rippled barbecue chip. It's good. It's not bad. Yeah, I can handle those. My favorite chip is a ripple all-dressed chip. I do like the Doritos too, but if you're going with a chip, ripple, like me, a Ruffles specifically, all-dressed. Well, we have got some chip-eaten scenarios coming up this week. We are going to be watching John Wick 2 because I'm going to see the opening of John Wick 3 this weekend with Keanu Reeves. Fantastic franchise. We are also going to check out the series finale of Big Bang Theory tonight. And of course, for those that don't know, we have that bet that we made yesterday on who was going to have the bigger audience for their series finale, or season finale, rather, series finale, Game of Thrones or Big Bang Theory. And our guesses are sealed. And the terms of the bet are if Candace loses, she has to get rid of her Jimmy Choo shoes that she's only worn twice in her entire life. And if I lose, I've got to get rid of boxes upon boxes upon boxes upon boxes of my DVDs that I've collected from over the years. It's a sad day. It's a sad day for both of us. Hey, you threw it down. Yeah, I know. You threw my shoes and, well, I'm throwing those random boxes from the back. So we got that and, of course, the season finale of series finale of Game of Thrones coming up on Sunday. Oh my gosh! I want to talk about it, but I know that all of our audience doesn't listen and I also know we have a spoiler-free that we talk about after each. Well, let's do, let's talk about this because there are some people online that are going crazy. They are so disappointed with the way season eight is going and the way some of their favorite characters are turning out that there is a petition online that is 35,000 signatures strong thus far asking for the writers to be fired from Game of Thrones, hire new ones, and completely redo season eight. Then those people should save their money and pay the salary of all the people that they want. These people do this because they were hired, because they were the best to do it, and this is the way that they wanted it executed. You are being entertained by these people and if you, 35,000 people, really want it all rewritten for your happy bow that you feel that it's supposed to be, because I'm sure all 35,000 of you really, really all agree that it should be the same way. And I'm sure you all do. And then what you should do is raise all that money and then you pay the salary of all the people that need to go ahead and make that execution for your work. I think it's funny. It's almost very childlike when you tell a child a story and they get so used to the story, whether it be a Christmas story or whatever it may be, and you decide to change a little bit and they go, no, no, no, tell it like you always, I want you to tell me a story, but I want you to tell it this way. Of course. Because people, they're so entitled. So entitled. It's entitlement. No, no, that's not the way I wanted the story to end. You've got to end it differently because my feelings are hurt. You're going to, do you remember, was it Black Mirror that had you could, you could pick the way the end of the show would work? Yeah, Bandersnatch. We reviewed that on Talking Movies with Brian Latake. It was very, it was a choose your own adventure style of storytelling, which they said they're going to be investing more money into because they were happy with the results of it. That's what I can see starting to happen after this Game of Thrones. Your next really big HBO show is going to have something similar happen to accommodate the feelings of people who feel that a paper cup was annoying, to see in a production or that they didn't like that. I don't want to give any spoilers, but they didn't like this and they didn't like that. And I've seen the memes. I think it's very silly. Well, remember, we heard the story about Jon Snow, Kit Harington. He got, he got married to one of the, his fellow cast members. And he had told her, because they have all signed NDAs, like they are sworn to secrecy. Like this one's buckled up as tight as Avengers Endgame was when it came to giving away spoilers for the show. And he told his wife the ending of what was going to happen as far as what he knew from the script. And didn't she, didn't he say that she didn't talk to him for two days? She was so angry. That's a rumor. Yeah. That I had read and online. I think it's come through, you know, to me many times. Yeah. Quite, quite upset about it. And she was probably upset based off the last episode. Well, and keep in mind, this is a story that is no stranger to killing off major characters, having twists and turns like television has never seen in a hundred years. My favorite that I've seen. Oh, I don't think I could say it. As far as predictions? No, as far as people being upset is that in the, in this episode, in this past episode. Careful now. No spoilers. Careful. Careful. A horse shows up. And people are upset that this horse shows up based off of what happens in the previous scene. And then yet they're not, because how could a horse just show up? And then you think, really? So the flying dragons, the white walkers. The mountain. These things were okay in your world, but the horse showing up was really what put you over the edge in this? This is what I mean. Really? Like you got, you got to get some hobbies. That's what these people need. Hobbies. Listen, if you're not happy with the way a story is told, then stop watching. Stop watching. Stop listening to the story. Yeah, or do, you know what's a really good idea? People always do those, they do it with Star Wars a lot because you show me them. They do these fan tributes where they say this. Fan films, yeah. Fan films. This is how I would have liked it to be, or could you imagine if this would have happened? Do that. Take that, those 35,000 people, pool your money together and do one of those. There's a great channel on YouTube called How It Should Have Ended, and it's very comedic, and they do it with a lot of superhero movies. And they, yeah, it's a very comedic take on how the movie probably should have, then their eyes should have ended to be much funnier. Yeah, I think it's great. Then go be a producer. Go be a lighting director. Go do all those things and do it yourself. I'll be honest with you, the reason why I watch movies and television shows is because I like the way it makes me feel. If it incites any kind of emotion in me, whether it be fear from watching a horror film, whether it be, you know, love from watching a romance movie or a comedic romance, or if you watch a comedy because you want to laugh, you're not watching Game of Thrones because you're looking for a happy ending. Yeah. That's not why you're watching the show. I know. I don't understand. They don't like the way certain characters have gone, and this scene... It's not your story. Your only job in this whole process is to watch, to be entertained. Right. And you are not even being, your entertainment isn't good enough for you. That's where we're at in society. Nope. No, this isn't good enough. I want to, I need to have a petition. I don't know how much you love petitions. Oh, sure, yeah. I'm actually looking at making a petition to stop petitions because I think petitions are stupid. They're ridiculous. Anyways, we have a very busy show. We will talk a little bit more entertainment. And you mentioned Black Mirror. I've got some news on that coming up in What's Trending Music News. You can use us on the way. We have some people guessing on what the newfie said on the Dave line yesterday. That's coming up a little bit later on. And Peepers responds to my question about him taking LSD. All that and more on a Thursday edition of We Learn in the Morning with Dave and Candice Ray. Busy right now. That is spring. Now that spring has sprung, he's got condos, he's got houses, he's got side-by-sides, he's got everything. If you are buying or selling property in Winnipeg or the surrounding area, check out mikemason.remax.ca. Get in touch with the guy We Learn in the Morning trusts with their real estate. Mike Mason of Remax. Click the link down in the pod script. This is a really tough story to read. This happened here in Winnipeg. A dog was beaten and stabbed three times and hate messages were spray-painted on the walls of a Winnipeg home after a break and enter. On Tuesday. When police arrived, they found the home that had been trashed and vandalized and the dog who also suffered from multiple wounds. They destroyed the inside of our house. The owner of the home wrote in a Facebook post that was accompanied by pictures of the aftermath. The photos show pictures that have been spray-painted over and over and one of the messages read die and the other messages read Paki lover die. The dog's family name is Petey and he was to the animal hospital where he is expected to survive. He was beat with a baseball bat and stabbed deeply three times with a butcher knife. Physically, he will survive. Mentally, that'll take time. We really don't know what the nature of the incident is at this time, says Constable Jay Murphy. Last month, Jewish cafe on Cordon was vandalized and hate messages were left on the walls. An investigation by Winnipeg police, however, led to allegations. That was fake. Yes. Yeah, it was fake. They ended up. Including the attack that left one of the owners injured was staged and charges against the owner of Beer Max Cafe. Yeah, so it's funny when that story came out, I didn't want to talk about it on the show, but I was chatting with a few friends about it and I said the worst part about that story is that when another story pops up where you see a possible hate crime happening, you're going to question it. And as soon as you started reading that, I kind of thought, hmm, I wonder if this is real, which is really too bad that my head even went there because that shit like that should be taken seriously. Desensitized. Yeah, totally. Right. And it's interesting. I thought when I read the article, I thought it was interesting that they also threw that back, an investigation and referring to an incident that happened last month, which was fake. So if it was fake and they know that it was fake, why bring it up now? Because that's how the media does things because they want you to go back and click on that. Oh, I didn't hear about that story. Well, then I guess I should as now somebody who reads this stuff, just not engage with it and not say anything until, you know, I'll be honest with you. I've been really disappointed with the way media has been going in the past five years. I mean, not even to touch on the whole Tommy Robinson situation, which is going on over in the UK, where here is a gentleman who was falsely imprisoned for 10 weeks in solitary confinement. They're they they are jailing journalists. This hasn't happened in 70 years. It's it's incredible just how the media the media is there. There's no more down the middle. Here's just the story. Everything's got to have a bias in it. Everything's got to have an angle on it. Everything's got to be, you know, supporting whatever the political agenda is for that company and where they stand politically. It's just it's it's really unfortunate. And again, it's a perfect example of somebody just saying, oh, yeah, but don't forget there is this fake one. So who knows? We'll do some investigating. But here's the story so far. Right. And if if this is true, which you would hope that not that I hope that it's true, but, you know, the media that, you know, that this isn't a false story, that there's not another person out there that's creating this. But you've you've really physically hurt a dog. Yeah. You know, and if that is where if that were to be fake, if you're going to go down that line, that's terrible. And that person should be prosecuted for that. And we shouldn't the media then shouldn't refer to it as a possible fake. Yeah, because it happened until the until all of a sudden, the story comes out. They've done the investigation three weeks from now. You know what? We can actually link this to this story together or not at all, because then, like you said, now you're reading it. And the first thing you thought of was, is this a fake story? Right. Is this somebody who set this up? Yeah, I it's getting harder and harder to read. I mean, it's funny. People always say, oh, Donald Trump, fake news. There is he's not wrong. There's a lot of fake news out there. And you can't just go on what you read anymore, because who knows what the person's agenda is behind it? There there's there's no more unbiased writing. Sad. Also, from what I know from analytics and SEO from companies, if you know how to work your analytics, and you can pay for your SEO, and you can pay for having your pages done properly with these big corporations, that's what makes you number one on these sites, you know, sometimes a new company will launch and all of a sudden, they're number one. You think, well, how did that happen? You have to have the right platform on the back end. That's why for us, it's taken us a long time to get safety net, even when you Google it on that first page, because I don't have the means to all these massive companies to like these news and media outlets to make them the first option that they have, or their sub companies also to have. Just to touch a little bit more on the whole Tommy Robinson thing. I won't get into details, but he was falsely imprisoned. The court ruled after 10 weeks of him being in prison said no, that that wasn't right. But now he decided to try and expose the this the things that we were talking about how biased media is and how biased governments are becoming. And he's trying to expose that. So he started he he's actually running for public office. He's running for one of the one of the seats in the European Union. And he's been banned off Facebook. He's been banned off Twitter. He's been banned off all social media because they're saying that he is a right wing racist. I have dug as deep as I could. I cannot find a single racist thing this man has done. He has protested radical Islam. He has protested I'll say that again. He has protested radical Islam, and has is very passionate about immigration laws in Britain in Great Britain. And because the general consensus is that that's, according to media is that that's racist. So he was go, Oh, he's racist, and he's gone. So now the courts are actually trying to retry him. They're trying to retry him on the exact same charge, which in North America is called double jeopardy. Yeah, I thought you weren't allowed. Yeah, it's called double jeopardy. And they're actually trying to hurt his campaign to sit. It kind of reminds me of that movie. Narcos where Pablo Escobar got voted in by the people in the government said, We don't care.
