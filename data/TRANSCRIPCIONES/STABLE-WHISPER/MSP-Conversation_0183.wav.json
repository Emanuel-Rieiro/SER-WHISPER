{"text": " HandUp is a business. It's a for-profit company. It says on your website that 100% of donations go to the people that are being supported. So I'm wondering, how does HandUp sustain itself if it's not taking any sort of cut from the donations that are going to people in the community? Yeah, that's a great question. And it's funny, we get that question a lot, which I think is good because people want to know, again, going back to transparency and accountability, they really want to understand how that works. So right now, like you said, we don't take a percentage of donations and we don't take a percentage from what we're passing on to our nonprofit partners either. We have an optional tip that we ask donors to contribute, $5 to HandUp that goes towards our operations. And between 85 and 90% of donors opt into this. So we've been able to continue using this model and it's been successful for us. There are other potential revenue channels in the future. I mean, we are building, again, this platform that's a tool for our nonprofit partners where they're able to engage with their clients. They're able to track transactions and redemptions and progress towards certain goals. So that platform, B2B software, may be an opportunity in the future. But yeah, right now, that optional tip model has been successful. So do you look at HandUp more as like a social network or is it more like a Kickstarter or somewhere in between? Or a crowdfunding platform, very similar to Akiva or even Indiegogo Life. But we have this evolving social network aspect and it's so cool to watch. So one of the things that donors can do when they contribute to someone on the site is send words of support. Really just positive messages like, I believe in you and I hope this donation helps, thinking about you. And these words of supports are sent to the recipient via text message or email. And what's awesome is then the recipients, the members who are fundraising on the site, are able to respond, again, via text message or email. And so there's this relationship built between the donors and the members fundraising on HandUp. And then beyond that, what we're seeing is donors offering in-kind donations. Oh, you're fundraising for a laptop? You know what? I have an old laptop that I want to give you. Or, oh, you're ready to look for work again? I might have an opportunity. And one time, we actually, Robert and Sandra, a couple, they were fundraising on HandUp to cover those month-to-month basic needs and they were homeless at the time. And because of HandUp, they were able to connect with someone in their neighborhood who happened to have an affordable place to live. And they ended up moving into this apartment and essentially graduating from HandUp because they were able to restabilize in their life. And it's those things that are so awesome to see. And when you think about peer-to-peer and what that means and using technology to bring humans together, that's happening. I mean, people want to connect with other people and, you know, give back but also feel connected to the impact that they're making. Yeah. So there's a lot of noise on the internet. It's hard to find meaning in a lot of it a lot of the times. But having a platform, it seems that dedicated to really extending a HandUp to people in the neighborhood, people local to you who you can have an immediate impact on. I can see a lot of value in that. Those were some great stories. Do you have any other inspiring stories of success that you can share about someone who's used your platform and graduated to, you know, being a self-sustaining person? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. There's so many wonderful stories. I mean, it's just, it's amazing to watch people progress also over three months, six months, a year. One recent story from end of last year, right before the holidays, a woman named Raquel, who is a single mom and also a teacher here in the Bay Area. Unfortunately, she found herself homeless with her children right before the holidays. So they were staying in hotels and sleeping in their car or, you know, kids dropped off with friends while Raquel slept in the car. I mean, just really challenging times. And I mean, just to know, one of those things about homelessness is it's sometimes it's temporary and it's very transitional. And I mean, Raquel was working at the time. So it's not always that image that many folks have in their head of what homelessness is. So Raquel, Raquel got connected with Project Homeless Connect, our partner here, and created a profile so that she could fundraise to move into stable housing. And in really just about a month, she raised over $3,000. She was able to handle some of those fees from hotels while they were waiting for an available place to live and then use that towards initial security deposit and moving costs. And so now Raquel and her kids are in a stable apartment and she's able to focus on, you know, continuing to be self-sufficient. And so we don't limit how many times someone would be able to fundraise on hand up. So now Raquel is fundraising for university fees so that she can go to school and take that next step for a sustainable career. That's a really great story. And so how many people have actually gone through your platform in total? Yeah. So let's see, hand up's just over a year and a half old. We've served over 500 people on the platform. So we've had over 500 people fundraise to meet their basic needs. Any idea of the success rate so far? You know, the way that we've been looking at success is goals met and needs met. So to date, we're looking at about 1,600 different basic needs that have been met on the platform, which again ranges from healthcare, housing, transportation, food, clothing. So I guess if you've had, you know, 500 something people on the platform and over a thousand needs met, it sounds like most of, most if not all of them have been successful, at least, at least getting one of their needs met. And that's really awesome. So what cities is hand up currently working in then? Where do you work now? And kind of how do you plan out where you're going to go next? Sure. So we, you know, we've been very focused here in the Bay Area. We have partners in San Francisco and East Bay as well as South Bay. And we now have over the past couple of months expanded beyond the Bay Area to partners in Detroit. As well as across Washington and Oregon State. Wow. Detroit in particular, I can definitely see a great need there. That's really awesome. So how can people get involved if they want to help somebody on hand up? Sure. I mean, I would encourage everyone to visit handup.org and read through people's stories and see who's fundraising and what their goals are. And of course, contributing towards those goals is really the best way to get involved right now. We also, we just launched a new product, which we call Hand Up Campaigns. So anyone can create a campaign to fundraise for a person that's on hand up or a specific area. So you could create a campaign for homelessness in San Francisco and fundraise for that. So that's just another way that you can get involved and rally your network and fundraise to give back in your own community. People that really are not sure how to give back or they want to contribute, but they just don't know how to go about it. I hope that Hand Up is a way for them to do that and see the impact that they're making. Yeah. I was actually just having a conversation at dinner the other night about how it's not even always a question of giving, but it's an ability to give. It's actually, sometimes it can be a question of, does someone have an ability to receive? Yeah. You know, there's a question of ego or of, I guess, humility or sometimes even shame, thinking like I need to actually ask strangers for help or even people I know for help. It can be very scary for people. No, that's very true. And that's why it's so important for us in how we share other stories and how we present people that it's in a way that's very respectful and very dignified. And again, that's also why it's a conversation with the person in need and their case manager to make sure that it's the right avenue for them. Right. We also, yeah, I mean, we also have ways that we can protect identities, especially for women who are survivors of domestic violence and that sort of thing. They obviously cannot show their photo and their real name. So we have the option to use a different photo and use an alias online as well. That's really interesting. Murphy, thank you so much for taking the time to join us on P2P Connects Us. And I'm looking forward to seeing more success on Hand Up in the future. Thank you so much. Thank you for inviting me on to share our story. And chat with your community. So thank you.

It's a for-profit company. It says on your website that 100% of donations go to the people that are being supported. So I'm wondering, how does HandUp sustain itself if it's not taking any sort of cut from the donations that are going to people in the community? Yeah, that's a great question. And it's funny, we get that question a lot, which I think is good because people want to know, again, going back to transparency and accountability, they really want to understand how that works. So right now, like you said, we don't take a percentage of donations and we don't take a percentage from what we're passing on to our nonprofit partners either. We have an optional tip that we ask donors to contribute, $5 to HandUp that goes towards our operations. And between 85 and 90% of donors opt into this. So we've been able to continue using this model and it's been successful for us. There are other potential revenue channels in the future. I mean, we are building, again, this platform that's a tool for our nonprofit partners where they're able to engage with their clients. They're able to track transactions and redemptions and progress towards certain goals. So that platform, B2B software, may be an opportunity in the future. But yeah, right now, that optional tip model has been successful. So do you look at HandUp more as like a social network or is it more like a Kickstarter or somewhere in between? Or a crowdfunding platform, very similar to Akiva or even Indiegogo Life. But we have this evolving social network aspect and it's so cool to watch. So one of the things that donors can do when they contribute to someone on the site is send words of support. Really just positive messages like, I believe in you and I hope this donation helps, thinking about you. And these words of supports are sent to the recipient via text message or email. And what's awesome is then the recipients, the members who are fundraising on the site, are able to respond, again, via text message or email. And so there's this relationship built between the donors and the members fundraising on HandUp. And then beyond that, what we're seeing is donors offering in-kind donations. Oh, you're fundraising for a laptop? You know what? I have an old laptop that I want to give you. Or, oh, you're ready to look for work again? I might have an opportunity. And one time, we actually, Robert and Sandra, a couple, they were fundraising on HandUp to cover those month-to-month basic needs and they were homeless at the time. And because of HandUp, they were able to connect with someone in their neighborhood who happened to have an affordable place to live. And they ended up moving into this apartment and essentially graduating from HandUp because they were able to restabilize in their life. And it's those things that are so awesome to see. And when you think about peer-to-peer and what that means and using technology to bring humans together, that's happening. I mean, people want to connect with other people and, you know, give back but also feel connected to the impact that they're making. Yeah. So there's a lot of noise on the internet. It's hard to find meaning in a lot of it a lot of the times. But having a platform, it seems that dedicated to really extending a HandUp to people in the neighborhood, people local to you who you can have an immediate impact on. I can see a lot of value in that. Those were some great stories. Do you have any other inspiring stories of success that you can share about someone who's used your platform and graduated to, you know, being a self-sustaining person? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. There's so many wonderful stories. I mean, it's just, it's amazing to watch people progress also over three months, six months, a year. One recent story from end of last year, right before the holidays, a woman named Raquel, who is a single mom and also a teacher here in the Bay Area. Unfortunately, she found herself homeless with her children right before the holidays. So they were staying in hotels and sleeping in their car or, you know, kids dropped off with friends while Raquel slept in the car. I mean, just really challenging times. And I mean, just to know, one of those things about homelessness is it's sometimes it's temporary and it's very transitional. And I mean, Raquel was working at the time. So it's not always that image that many folks have in their head of what homelessness is. So Raquel, Raquel got connected with Project Homeless Connect, our partner here, and created a profile so that she could fundraise to move into stable housing. And in really just about a month, she raised over $3,000. She was able to handle some of those fees from hotels while they were waiting for an available place to live and then use that towards initial security deposit and moving costs. And so now Raquel and her kids are in a stable apartment and she's able to focus on, you know, continuing to be self-sufficient. And so we don't limit how many times someone would be able to fundraise on hand up. So now Raquel is fundraising for university fees so that she can go to school and take that next step for a sustainable career. That's a really great story. And so how many people have actually gone through your platform in total? Yeah. So let's see, hand up's just over a year and a half old. We've served over 500 people on the platform. So we've had over 500 people fundraise to meet their basic needs. Any idea of the success rate so far? You know, the way that we've been looking at success is goals met and needs met. So to date, we're looking at about 1,600 different basic needs that have been met on the platform, which again ranges from healthcare, housing, transportation, food, clothing. So I guess if you've had, you know, 500 something people on the platform and over a thousand needs met, it sounds like most of, most if not all of them have been successful, at least, at least getting one of their needs met. And that's really awesome. So what cities is hand up currently working in then? Where do you work now? And kind of how do you plan out where you're going to go next? Sure. So we, you know, we've been very focused here in the Bay Area. We have partners in San Francisco and East Bay as well as South Bay. And we now have over the past couple of months expanded beyond the Bay Area to partners in Detroit. As well as across Washington and Oregon State. Wow. Detroit in particular, I can definitely see a great need there. That's really awesome. So how can people get involved if they want to help somebody on hand up? Sure. I mean, I would encourage everyone to visit handup.org and read through people's stories and see who's fundraising and what their goals are. And of course, contributing towards those goals is really the best way to get involved right now. We also, we just launched a new product, which we call Hand Up Campaigns. So anyone can create a campaign to fundraise for a person that's on hand up or a specific area. So you could create a campaign for homelessness in San Francisco and fundraise for that. So that's just another way that you can get involved and rally your network and fundraise to give back in your own community. People that really are not sure how to give back or they want to contribute, but they just don't know how to go about it. I hope that Hand Up is a way for them to do that and see the impact that they're making. Yeah. I was actually just having a conversation at dinner the other night about how it's not even always a question of giving, but it's an ability to give. It's actually, sometimes it can be a question of, does someone have an ability to receive? Yeah. You know, there's a question of ego or of, I guess, humility or sometimes even shame, thinking like I need to actually ask strangers for help or even people I know for help. It can be very scary for people. No, that's very true. And that's why it's so important for us in how we share other stories and how we present people that it's in a way that's very respectful and very dignified. And again, that's also why it's a conversation with the person in need and their case manager to make sure that it's the right avenue for them. Right. We also, yeah, I mean, we also have ways that we can protect identities, especially for women who are survivors of domestic violence and that sort of thing. They obviously cannot show their photo and their real name. So we have the option to use a different photo and use an alias online as well. That's really interesting. Murphy, thank you so much for taking the time to join us on P2P Connects Us. And I'm looking forward to seeing more success on Hand Up in the future. Thank you so much.
