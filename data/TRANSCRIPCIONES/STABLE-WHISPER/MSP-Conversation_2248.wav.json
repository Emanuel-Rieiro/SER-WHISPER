{"text": " And it would be unrealistic to not have any mention of her being a woman, obviously. But I thought it was very realistically and like not it wasn't subtle, but it was a a real world like example of like, yeah, they didn't let us do this because we're women, obviously. So we so that's why we would do these test runs. But I mean, like the whole movie wasn't centered around that. It was about really appreciated that. Yeah. And it was so nice because it was like, oh, finally, we just it's just that she's human. Yeah, that's why they don't trust her. They don't understand her not because oh, she's a woman. And yet and yet it this movie, it is universal in that humanity, but it also very specifically talk speaks to the experience of being a woman, which I really appreciated. Like, so they don't go ahead and like say it that much, which I was a little bit worried about it. But like, I was a little worried about it in terms of like, so at the trailer, you know, the trailer, how it's like, it all starts with a hero. And then it like, or like, it all starts with her and then it changes. Yeah, a hero. And that was like, very cheesy. I'm like, okay, I understand why you did it because it's the easy like shot. But I was a little bit annoyed with that. It's like, oh, look, she's like female hero kind of thing. And it's, it's only I think it's only annoying because it feels almost a little condescending because it's taken this fucking long to make a female led MCU. But anyway, I mean, I'm, I'm totally fine with it being in the marketing because it wasn't in the movie at all. Yes, yes. And that's why like, that's why I am. That's why I was very happy with the movie in that aspect. And yet, and I want to get into this later, but I want to kind of go over first impressions first. But I did want to mention the the falling down scene was so good, powerful and strong to me when she just the getting up again. And how we just, it speaks to humanity and the voiceover is just like, that's what makes her human. That's what makes her like get back up again. But we still only saw photos of like only saw images of her we didn't see it didn't cut to like, different humans around the world. It still is her and it is significant because she's a woman and that's part of her and her experience. Yeah, and that scene in particular, I mean, my heart swelled a little bit when that happened. But really, it's, it's gotten to a point where I'm happy to say that I feel like, you know, I used to say, Oh, this is a movie that I wish that I had when I was 10 years old. Yeah, thankfully, it's like, Oh, this is a movie that can join all those other things that I wish I had when I was 10 years old, because there's so many now. And at that point, I'm like, this movie is it? For me, I feel like this movie is for the 10 year olds that are watching the, you know, her as a 10 year old get up from, you know, falling off her bike or, or get up from baseball or whatever, because it's like, I liked that they had actual like flashbacks to her. Yes, child. Yes. Oh, my gosh. I was like, okay, that's this is for the, you know, the eight year olds that are watching this movie right now. We have the same brain because I was literally just thinking about how I loved how specific it was. Because it didn't just show her like, falling down, like, when she was in Air Force training, and then when she was a Cree, etc. But it showed her as a young girl as well. And that felt very, like, I, I, I like cried at that part. Because yeah, so there's something so powerful about seeing that it's, it's not just her throughout her years, because because it's not just showing her lifetime, it's showing the significance of young girls getting up again. And yeah, I have a hard time. It's hard to say hard to explain, because it's, it's, it's very, it feels very important. And I know you said, like, like, it is for those girls. But I also still do feel like it's for me. And it's for it's for us and the young girls that we used to be and the women we will become. And it's for it's for humans. It's for Yeah, I guess it's more of like other like Warner Woman and the new She-Ra and like all these other things that I wish that I had when I was younger, I would be like, Oh, this is this is for me. And then this was the first time that I watched a movie that I was like, Oh, now instead of thinking about me wanting this movie, I immediately think of the 10 year olds sitting behind me that get to see this and how I didn't have a movie like this when I was 10. And so that's just it's a cool transition. I feel like we're finally I'm finally at the point where you're starting to become more things that I wish I had. And this is just another one to add to the list. And that's really cool. It's I have a list now. It's no longer like, Oh, the first time I've ever seen, you know, this, it's like, No, I've seen this a lot lately. And that's awesome. Yeah. And it's as always, it's there needs to be more and for more people and more diverse. You get it. We get it. But it's still it. I want to celebrate this because it is it is important. And I'm glad that this exists now. Yeah, very cool to see. And I love that we got to see like multiple women as well with Dr. Lawson and Maria and her daughter, Monica, who is so cute. I loved her. She's like, I got the ketchup stains out. And it was so cool that she got to help design like the colors. Yes, I'm not gonna lie that like, that like neon thing that was going on before they settled on the when they were like, definitely not. I was like, yes, be a neon light, please. But it's great because like, she doesn't have to be a neon light, but we can have other superhero women who are who are like the neon light. I'm so excited because this movie opens up the possibility for other, like, like different kinds of women being in the front like superheroes because like, I love I love sarcastic, smart, determined Carol, but I am so excited to see other variations of like personalities that we get to see because it's so great. Another another moment that I was thinking of that kind of highlights like the experience of being a woman, obviously, it's a little upsetting is when the fucking dude on a motorcycle is like, hey, yeah, and like the whole like, you should smile more kind of thing, which is just laughing, right? It's so hard. Like, I really like that scene. But it was also like hard to watch a little bit because it is so relatable, I guess, in a upsetting way. I maybe it illustrated how stupid it is. Exactly. And I saw an interviewer, there was an interviewer who asked her about that scene, because I know I'm going to talk a little bit about the trolls again. But there's backlash on like her the posters, because people were like, why is she smiling in the posters, whatever. And so an interviewer asked her like, so that scene, was that in the movie before you got that feedback? Or like, was that is that kind of like a nod to like, the haters like, fuck you. And she's like, no, that was that was definitely in the that was in the movie before, like, we got the backlash about like her not smiling in the posters. It's just because that's like a an experience that women have all the time. So it's, yeah, the I think the interviewer said, like, so so does that mean like, that art predicts life or whatever? She's like, No, this is like a common thread that. Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, she steals his bike. I was like, yes. That was so good. Just like beat him up. She was just like, lowers her newspaper and looks at the bike. And I'm like, fuck, yeah, girl, get it. Motorcycle thief. I love her. Yeah. And you know, I, of course, I was super excited about how it was gonna be set in the 90s and everything. But I felt like the whole like 90s throwback stuff was, it was like the perfect amount. Like the fact that she's having to go to an internet cafe to Oh my god, go on Alta Vista. And then she has to use an actual map to, you know, find out what places and she she kind of adapts like the grunge look. Nick's like, the grunge is a good look for you or something. When she steals off the mannequin. But the one of the funniest scenes is when they are loading screen. So yes, oh my god. So after Talos, the scroll, it's like, I want you to hear this, like, intermission for or like the from the black box. Yeah, just like, as they're all waiting. And she's like, what are we waiting for? And they're like, it's loading. And they're all just very patient, but but not annoyed. Because it could have been it could have been very cheesy to make it like, oh, they're so annoyed. Get it because it's taking so long to load. But no, that's, that's life in the 90s. Why would it be faster? That doesn't? Why would it be faster? It takes time to process information. That's what that's exactly what I mean. It was just like, it wasn't like, oh, let's throw in all these like 90s references. It was just like, yeah, that's, that's, that's how CDs loaded. Like, you just had to wait. Wait on that little bar. And just get comfy. And I was just like, yeah. And in the security, the security guard, when Nick Fury finds her, he's like, he said he saw someone breaking out of the blockbuster woman who looked like she was dressed up for laser tag. And I love that because laser tag was like way more popular back then in the 90s. Also, and like, cosplay didn't really exist. So nowadays, if they made it set in the like, to like 2019, it'd be like someone said like they were dressed up for a science sci fi convention or whatever. But that's like, it felt very, very perfect. And well, well attuned to the 90s. But not overwhelming. Not like a parody of the 90s. Yeah, like, it wasn't just like bombarding you. It's like, you know, the soundtrack was great. Yeah, I was like, this is good. And, but it's funny, because one of the other moments that I laughed because of the friend that I was seeing it with, and who was sitting next to me is when she when she's talking to the cop after she comes out of the blockbuster. And she's like, do you have any place that has communication devices? Friend is next to me. She's just like, Radio Shack, Radio Shack. And I was like, of course, they're gonna show her. Man. Oh, my gosh. Radio Shack. It was good. It was. I must say, I think this is like the perfect, the perfect movie for us to discuss on Generation Fangirl. It feels very much made for us in our nostalgic land. It's it was so much fun. And I hope like, I like that it wasn't so it wasn't like set in the 90s as a parody to appease people who didn't know the 90s. Right? Yeah. But it was set like, realistically in the 90s. It's not like making the 90s a joke", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.32, "text": " And it would be unrealistic to not have any mention of her being a woman,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [400, 309,

But I thought it was very realistically and like not it wasn't subtle, but it was a a real world like example of like, yeah, they didn't let us do this because we're women, obviously. So we so that's why we would do these test runs. But I mean, like the whole movie wasn't centered around that. It was about really appreciated that. Yeah. And it was so nice because it was like, oh, finally, we just it's just that she's human. Yeah, that's why they don't trust her. They don't understand her not because oh, she's a woman. And yet and yet it this movie, it is universal in that humanity, but it also very specifically talk speaks to the experience of being a woman, which I really appreciated. Like, so they don't go ahead and like say it that much, which I was a little bit worried about it. But like, I was a little worried about it in terms of like, so at the trailer, you know, the trailer, how it's like, it all starts with a hero. And then it like, or like, it all starts with her and then it changes. Yeah, a hero. And that was like, very cheesy. I'm like, okay, I understand why you did it because it's the easy like shot. But I was a little bit annoyed with that. It's like, oh, look, she's like female hero kind of thing. And it's, it's only I think it's only annoying because it feels almost a little condescending because it's taken this fucking long to make a female led MCU. But anyway, I mean, I'm, I'm totally fine with it being in the marketing because it wasn't in the movie at all. Yes, yes. And that's why like, that's why I am. That's why I was very happy with the movie in that aspect. And yet, and I want to get into this later, but I want to kind of go over first impressions first. But I did want to mention the the falling down scene was so good, powerful and strong to me when she just the getting up again. And how we just, it speaks to humanity and the voiceover is just like, that's what makes her human. That's what makes her like get back up again. But we still only saw photos of like only saw images of her we didn't see it didn't cut to like, different humans around the world. It still is her and it is significant because she's a woman and that's part of her and her experience. Yeah, and that scene in particular, I mean, my heart swelled a little bit when that happened. But really, it's, it's gotten to a point where I'm happy to say that I feel like, you know, I used to say, Oh, this is a movie that I wish that I had when I was 10 years old. Yeah, thankfully, it's like, Oh, this is a movie that can join all those other things that I wish I had when I was 10 years old, because there's so many now. And at that point, I'm like, this movie is it? For me, I feel like this movie is for the 10 year olds that are watching the, you know, her as a 10 year old get up from, you know, falling off her bike or, or get up from baseball or whatever, because it's like, I liked that they had actual like flashbacks to her. Yes, child. Yes. Oh, my gosh. I was like, okay, that's this is for the, you know, the eight year olds that are watching this movie right now. We have the same brain because I was literally just thinking about how I loved how specific it was. Because it didn't just show her like, falling down, like, when she was in Air Force training, and then when she was a Cree, etc. But it showed her as a young girl as well. And that felt very, like, I, I, I like cried at that part. Because yeah, so there's something so powerful about seeing that it's, it's not just her throughout her years, because because it's not just showing her lifetime, it's showing the significance of young girls getting up again. And yeah, I have a hard time. It's hard to say hard to explain, because it's, it's, it's very, it feels very important. And I know you said, like, like, it is for those girls. But I also still do feel like it's for me. And it's for it's for us and the young girls that we used to be and the women we will become. And it's for it's for humans. It's for Yeah, I guess it's more of like other like Warner Woman and the new She-Ra and like all these other things that I wish that I had when I was younger, I would be like, Oh, this is this is for me. And then this was the first time that I watched a movie that I was like, Oh, now instead of thinking about me wanting this movie, I immediately think of the 10 year olds sitting behind me that get to see this and how I didn't have a movie like this when I was 10. And so that's just it's a cool transition. I feel like we're finally I'm finally at the point where you're starting to become more things that I wish I had. And this is just another one to add to the list. And that's really cool. It's I have a list now. It's no longer like, Oh, the first time I've ever seen, you know, this, it's like, No, I've seen this a lot lately. And that's awesome. Yeah. And it's as always, it's there needs to be more and for more people and more diverse. You get it. We get it. But it's still it. I want to celebrate this because it is it is important. And I'm glad that this exists now. Yeah, very cool to see. And I love that we got to see like multiple women as well with Dr. Lawson and Maria and her daughter, Monica, who is so cute. I loved her. She's like, I got the ketchup stains out. And it was so cool that she got to help design like the colors. Yes, I'm not gonna lie that like, that like neon thing that was going on before they settled on the when they were like, definitely not. I was like, yes, be a neon light, please. But it's great because like, she doesn't have to be a neon light, but we can have other superhero women who are who are like the neon light. I'm so excited because this movie opens up the possibility for other, like, like different kinds of women being in the front like superheroes because like, I love I love sarcastic, smart, determined Carol, but I am so excited to see other variations of like personalities that we get to see because it's so great. Another another moment that I was thinking of that kind of highlights like the experience of being a woman, obviously, it's a little upsetting is when the fucking dude on a motorcycle is like, hey, yeah, and like the whole like, you should smile more kind of thing, which is just laughing, right? It's so hard. Like, I really like that scene. But it was also like hard to watch a little bit because it is so relatable, I guess, in a upsetting way. I maybe it illustrated how stupid it is. Exactly. And I saw an interviewer, there was an interviewer who asked her about that scene, because I know I'm going to talk a little bit about the trolls again. But there's backlash on like her the posters, because people were like, why is she smiling in the posters, whatever. And so an interviewer asked her like, so that scene, was that in the movie before you got that feedback? Or like, was that is that kind of like a nod to like, the haters like, fuck you. And she's like, no, that was that was definitely in the that was in the movie before, like, we got the backlash about like her not smiling in the posters. It's just because that's like a an experience that women have all the time. So it's, yeah, the I think the interviewer said, like, so so does that mean like, that art predicts life or whatever? She's like, No, this is like a common thread that. Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, she steals his bike. I was like, yes. That was so good. Just like beat him up. She was just like, lowers her newspaper and looks at the bike. And I'm like, fuck, yeah, girl, get it. Motorcycle thief. I love her. Yeah. And you know, I, of course, I was super excited about how it was gonna be set in the 90s and everything. But I felt like the whole like 90s throwback stuff was, it was like the perfect amount. Like the fact that she's having to go to an internet cafe to Oh my god, go on Alta Vista. And then she has to use an actual map to, you know, find out what places and she she kind of adapts like the grunge look. Nick's like, the grunge is a good look for you or something. When she steals off the mannequin. But the one of the funniest scenes is when they are loading screen. So yes, oh my god. So after Talos, the scroll, it's like, I want you to hear this, like, intermission for or like the from the black box. Yeah, just like, as they're all waiting. And she's like, what are we waiting for? And they're like, it's loading. And they're all just very patient, but but not annoyed. Because it could have been it could have been very cheesy to make it like, oh, they're so annoyed. Get it because it's taking so long to load. But no, that's, that's life in the 90s. Why would it be faster? That doesn't? Why would it be faster? It takes time to process information. That's what that's exactly what I mean. It was just like, it wasn't like, oh, let's throw in all these like 90s references. It was just like, yeah, that's, that's, that's how CDs loaded. Like, you just had to wait. Wait on that little bar. And just get comfy. And I was just like, yeah. And in the security, the security guard, when Nick Fury finds her, he's like, he said he saw someone breaking out of the blockbuster woman who looked like she was dressed up for laser tag. And I love that because laser tag was like way more popular back then in the 90s. Also, and like, cosplay didn't really exist. So nowadays, if they made it set in the like, to like 2019, it'd be like someone said like they were dressed up for a science sci fi convention or whatever. But that's like, it felt very, very perfect. And well, well attuned to the 90s. But not overwhelming. Not like a parody of the 90s. Yeah, like, it wasn't just like bombarding you. It's like, you know, the soundtrack was great. Yeah, I was like, this is good. And, but it's funny, because one of the other moments that I laughed because of the friend that I was seeing it with, and who was sitting next to me is when she when she's talking to the cop after she comes out of the blockbuster. And she's like, do you have any place that has communication devices? Friend is next to me. She's just like, Radio Shack, Radio Shack. And I was like, of course, they're gonna show her. Man. Oh, my gosh. Radio Shack. It was good. It was. I must say, I think this is like the perfect, the perfect movie for us to discuss on Generation Fangirl. It feels very much made for us in our nostalgic land. It's it was so much fun. And I hope like, I like that it wasn't so it wasn't like set in the 90s as a parody to appease people who didn't know the 90s. Right? Yeah. But it was set like, realistically in the 90s. It's not like making the 90s a joke", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.68, "text": " And it would be unrealistic to not have any mention of her being a woman, obviously.", "seek": 0.0,
