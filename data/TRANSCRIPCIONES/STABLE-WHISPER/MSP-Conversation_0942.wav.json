{"text": " So I saw a tweet that referenced our great liberal feminist prime minister. It talked about a mosque visit he did recently. It was a tweet by at David Akin, A-K-I-N, senior reporter for the National Post, which stated, only men are permitted on the main floor. Women will watch Trudeau from the balcony. Diversity can be a source of strength, not just a source of weakness. And as I look at this beautiful room with the sisters upstairs, everyone here, the diversity we have just within this mosque. Only men are permitted on the main floor. Women will watch Trudeau from the balcony. All I tweeted was that this was not okay. And I dug up another old tweet of mine, which showed a contrast of Trudeau standing surrounded by women at the pride parade. And then another picture with him raising his hands in prayer at an obviously gender segregated mosque. Both those tweets led to a bit of a Twitter storm. People compared it to gender segregation in sports, gender bathrooms. Vegans mentioned the morality of attending events that serve meat and the predictable, but Orthodox Jews do it too. So let me start by dismantling some of these comparisons. Yes, Orthodox Jews do it too. And I'd oppose our country's leader participating in that as well. You can dialogue with conservative religious people without participating in their bad practices. Gender segregated event at a mosque is not the same as him using a gender segregated public toilet. Can't believe I'm having to explain this, but here goes. Attending a mosque that shoves women in the back and going to a men's washroom is not comparable because the second class status of women in Islam and in major religions generally, in fact, is pretty evident. If you engage with the scriptures, honestly, washrooms were actually not segregated to make women second class citizens, but to make them more comfortable, perhaps. However, in 2016, with increased awareness about trans rights, it is pretty evident that they do exclude and add to the marginalization of our trans population. So, of course, I'm on board with that fight too. And honestly, my main concern regarding toilets is just people not peeing on seats. Anyway, so the initial intent of segregated public toilets was never to exclude women or trans people. And yes, I get it. Now, with Christian conservatives fighting for it to continue, I'm sure at times certain washrooms are segregated with the specific intent to exclude. And if Trudeau knowingly participated in a trans exclusionary event, I'd complain about that too. So, to sum it up, the intent behind shoving women to the back of the mosque is quite different and far more sinister than the original intent of creating male and female washrooms. The intent to exclude is deliberate in one and an unfortunate side effect of the other. That people are trying to rectify. Moving on to gender segregation in sports. Don't we think there could be an understandable reason for women to compete with women and men to compete with men? To even out the playing field, maybe? Cue the social justice warriors jumping in to call me a transphobe or anti-feminist. For the record, I don't think it's anti-feminist to say that, on the whole, biological males will likely have more upper body strength. I mean, demanding to be treated equally doesn't mean we have to pretend to be exactly the same as men in all aspects. We're built a bit differently, and that's okay. And before I excite the anti-feminists, actual transphobes, and anti-leftists too much, let me say I am a proud feminist, and I also care about trans rights. Yes, gender separation in sports presents some challenges and tough spots for trans athletes, and I'm not even sure where I stand on some of those issues. But again, the intent of dividing the sports that way was not to exclude. Sticking women in a different, less central area of the mosque is precisely done for the reason of excluding. To make sure they aren't evoking feelings of lust in men, who are supposedly not civilized or in control of their bodies enough to handle the mere presence of women. An insult to both men and women, if you ask me. So no, Justin Trudeau attending a gender-segregated mosque event is not at all the same thing as him going to a gendered bathroom or a sporting event which groups men and women in separate categories. As for the vegan argument, it's really comparing apples to oranges. Justin is a self-identified feminist, who is participating in an event that is quite obviously not treating women equally. You'd totally have a comparable case if Justin was a self-professed vegan, but continued to contradict himself and participated in events that mistreated animals, or went to a steak night after talking about how it's 2016 and he doesn't eat animals. Look, I totally get that Justin, Obama, and gang, they need to be politicians, and they need to cater to all groups, and try and ease tensions, build bridges, but their refusal to address any issues within Islam results in the opposite of easing tensions. Muslims start being seen as a group that gets special privileges, that is shielded from criticism, even in the face of extreme and sometimes worrying behavior. And this gives power to anti-Muslim bigots, who more and more seem like the only people addressing it. Incorrectly and tribally addressing it for all the wrong reasons, sure, but at least on the surface, they seem not to be engaging in denial or apologetics for such bad practices. Such gender exclusion should not be okayed. Like racial segregation isn't. Make it a relic, please. Toss it into the history books, where it belongs. Support us. Help us nudge our communities forward. At the very least, don't participate in regressive events. Support those of us from Muslim communities that are fighting for equality, for more rights, not those of us fighting to perpetuate these archaic practices. If you visit mosques, find some that are LGBT friendly, or women friendly. It is possible. They do exist. Prop those Muslims up. I speak to you today as a woman born and raised in Islam. Please don't hold us to a lower standard of morality. Your intent may be noble, to simply protect minorities, but it results in lower standards and the infantilization of our communities. And increased hostility from those who truly are bigoted towards us. I agree. It's a fine line to walk between critiquing Islam and opposing increasing anti-Muslim bigotry. But it's totally doable. You don't have to pick just one of those things. We can call out bad practices and stand out from Muslims who face prejudice. I speak as an ex-Muslim today because I couldn't reconcile my faith with modernity. Because I couldn't reconcile the belief in a magical sky being with logic or adulthood. But despite being an ex-Muslim, I'm very much a part of the community. I care for it and want the best for it. I've said this before, but with Trump on the rise, it's of utmost importance that compassionate liberals address these issues. So please, dear Mr. Prime Minister, consider that it is 2016. And if equality is important to you, if feminism matters, please, at the very least, do not partake in events where women are treated like second-class citizens. Sincerely, a liberal Canadian immigrant woman from the Muslim community. And before I end this, I will briefly address the flip side too. No, this isn't a Sharia takeover of Canada. And those who think it is clearly have no idea what living under Sharia is like. Let's scale it back. Accurate, proportionate, and fair criticism is important. Otherwise, no one takes you seriously and you turn into a Pamela Geller type. Let's not do that. Oppose bigotry on both sides.

our great liberal feminist prime minister. It talked about a mosque visit he did recently. It was a tweet by at David Akin, A-K-I-N, senior reporter for the National Post, which stated, only men are permitted on the main floor. Women will watch Trudeau from the balcony. Diversity can be a source of strength, not just a source of weakness. And as I look at this beautiful room with the sisters upstairs, everyone here, the diversity we have just within this mosque. Only men are permitted on the main floor. Women will watch Trudeau from the balcony. All I tweeted was that this was not okay. And I dug up another old tweet of mine, which showed a contrast of Trudeau standing surrounded by women at the pride parade. And then another picture with him raising his hands in prayer at an obviously gender segregated mosque. Both those tweets led to a bit of a Twitter storm. People compared it to gender segregation in sports, gender bathrooms. Vegans mentioned the morality of attending events that serve meat and the predictable, but Orthodox Jews do it too. So let me start by dismantling some of these comparisons. Yes, Orthodox Jews do it too. And I'd oppose our country's leader participating in that as well. You can dialogue with conservative religious people without participating in their bad practices. Gender segregated event at a mosque is not the same as him using a gender segregated public toilet. Can't believe I'm having to explain this, but here goes. Attending a mosque that shoves women in the back and going to a men's washroom is not comparable because the second class status of women in Islam and in major religions generally, in fact, is pretty evident. If you engage with the scriptures, honestly, washrooms were actually not segregated to make women second class citizens, but to make them more comfortable, perhaps. However, in 2016, with increased awareness about trans rights, it is pretty evident that they do exclude and add to the marginalization of our trans population. So, of course, I'm on board with that fight too. And honestly, my main concern regarding toilets is just people not peeing on seats. Anyway, so the initial intent of segregated public toilets was never to exclude women or trans people. And yes, I get it. Now, with Christian conservatives fighting for it to continue, I'm sure at times certain washrooms are segregated with the specific intent to exclude. And if Trudeau knowingly participated in a trans exclusionary event, I'd complain about that too. So, to sum it up, the intent behind shoving women to the back of the mosque is quite different and far more sinister than the original intent of creating male and female washrooms. The intent to exclude is deliberate in one and an unfortunate side effect of the other. That people are trying to rectify. Moving on to gender segregation in sports. Don't we think there could be an understandable reason for women to compete with women and men to compete with men? To even out the playing field, maybe? Cue the social justice warriors jumping in to call me a transphobe or anti-feminist. For the record, I don't think it's anti-feminist to say that, on the whole, biological males will likely have more upper body strength. I mean, demanding to be treated equally doesn't mean we have to pretend to be exactly the same as men in all aspects. We're built a bit differently, and that's okay. And before I excite the anti-feminists, actual transphobes, and anti-leftists too much, let me say I am a proud feminist, and I also care about trans rights. Yes, gender separation in sports presents some challenges and tough spots for trans athletes, and I'm not even sure where I stand on some of those issues. But again, the intent of dividing the sports that way was not to exclude. Sticking women in a different, less central area of the mosque is precisely done for the reason of excluding. To make sure they aren't evoking feelings of lust in men, who are supposedly not civilized or in control of their bodies enough to handle the mere presence of women. An insult to both men and women, if you ask me. So no, Justin Trudeau attending a gender-segregated mosque event is not at all the same thing as him going to a gendered bathroom or a sporting event which groups men and women in separate categories. As for the vegan argument, it's really comparing apples to oranges. Justin is a self-identified feminist, who is participating in an event that is quite obviously not treating women equally. You'd totally have a comparable case if Justin was a self-professed vegan, but continued to contradict himself and participated in events that mistreated animals, or went to a steak night after talking about how it's 2016 and he doesn't eat animals. Look, I totally get that Justin, Obama, and gang, they need to be politicians, and they need to cater to all groups, and try and ease tensions, build bridges, but their refusal to address any issues within Islam results in the opposite of easing tensions. Muslims start being seen as a group that gets special privileges, that is shielded from criticism, even in the face of extreme and sometimes worrying behavior. And this gives power to anti-Muslim bigots, who more and more seem like the only people addressing it. Incorrectly and tribally addressing it for all the wrong reasons, sure, but at least on the surface, they seem not to be engaging in denial or apologetics for such bad practices. Such gender exclusion should not be okayed. Like racial segregation isn't. Make it a relic, please. Toss it into the history books, where it belongs. Support us. Help us nudge our communities forward. At the very least, don't participate in regressive events. Support those of us from Muslim communities that are fighting for equality, for more rights, not those of us fighting to perpetuate these archaic practices. If you visit mosques, find some that are LGBT friendly, or women friendly. It is possible. They do exist. Prop those Muslims up. I speak to you today as a woman born and raised in Islam. Please don't hold us to a lower standard of morality. Your intent may be noble, to simply protect minorities, but it results in lower standards and the infantilization of our communities. And increased hostility from those who truly are bigoted towards us. I agree. It's a fine line to walk between critiquing Islam and opposing increasing anti-Muslim bigotry. But it's totally doable. You don't have to pick just one of those things. We can call out bad practices and stand out from Muslims who face prejudice. I speak as an ex-Muslim today because I couldn't reconcile my faith with modernity. Because I couldn't reconcile the belief in a magical sky being with logic or adulthood. But despite being an ex-Muslim, I'm very much a part of the community. I care for it and want the best for it. I've said this before, but with Trump on the rise, it's of utmost importance that compassionate liberals address these issues. So please, dear Mr. Prime Minister, consider that it is 2016. And if equality is important to you, if feminism matters, please, at the very least, do not partake in events where women are treated like second-class citizens. Sincerely, a liberal Canadian immigrant woman from the Muslim community. And before I end this, I will briefly address the flip side too. No, this isn't a Sharia takeover of Canada. And those who think it is clearly have no idea what living under Sharia is like. Let's scale it back. Accurate, proportionate, and fair criticism is important. Otherwise, no one takes you seriously and you turn into a Pamela Geller type. Let's not do that. Oppose bigotry on both sides.
