{"text": " article is an excerpt from a new book, the Research Ed Guide to Education Myths, just published by John Catt International. And if our website traffic is any indication, the excerpt seems to have struck a chord with readers. The myth you set out to bust is that memorable events provide the template for creating memorable lessons. And you argue that the key to understanding why that's a myth is to recognize that there are two different types of memory. So what are those types of memory and how do they differ? Yeah, I mean, as you said, it's really understandable why any of us would think that, but it's based in a misunderstanding about these two types of memory. So we have these two types of memory. We have episodic memory. So if you think about the words episode, episodic, it's that's our autobiographical memory, the memory of our everyday memory that just happens. You don't consciously think, oh, what did I have for breakfast? What did I have for lunch? You just know that stuff. You just sort of remember it. But it's a very sort of easy come, easy go kind of memory. So you'll remember what you had for lunch, you know, yesterday maybe or a couple of days ago. But if I said, what did you have for lunch on March the 19th? Yeah, you probably don't remember. It's very unlikely to remember. So that's episodic memory. And then the other kind of memory is semantic memory. And that's memory that is more tightly organized and it takes effort. So you need to sort of think about things in order to actually remember them in your semantic memory. One thing you could think about is, you know, if you're being driven around somewhere, like maybe when you were a kid, you didn't really attend to how you got somewhere. So you may, if it's a journey did lots, you may remember, you may not. You're driving yourself and you actually have to remember the route. That's when you actually attended to it and you actually remembered it. So yeah, semantic memory takes conscious effort to remember. Episodic doesn't really at all. And you argue that ultimately what schools are trying to do, despite the fact that much of what we consciously remember about our schooling experience is episodic in nature, what schools are actually trying to do is to produce semantic memories. Is that right? Yeah. I mean, there's nothing wrong with episodic memory. It's not like a bad thing. It's just not so useful in terms of doing the things that schools want students to be able to do, which is to leave at the end, ultimately able to think critically and creatively about stuff. And in order to do that, we need to build semantic memory. And the reason why that's superior for those kinds of tasks is because it's much more flexible and transferable than episodic. And if I can just explain why that is with your episodic memories, they're very tagged with your, with contextual cues. So you remember, if you're remembering something, you remember all sorts of other things that go with that, like where you were, what the noises were, who you were with, how hot it was, et cetera, et cetera. So because it's tagged with those contextual cues, then in order to remember it, you generally need those contextual cues to remember it. Or sometimes you remember the contextual cues rather than the actual thing. And anyone who's taught anyone will probably be really familiar with this, that you teach a lesson and then the next day you say, hey, do you remember what we were learning yesterday? And the students will tell you all sorts of things about the context of the lesson, like, hey, we were using scissors or Marty was late or it was really hot or you knocked your coffee over. Yeah, all those things happen. What about the stuff I was teaching you? And they can't remember that. And that's because they've got episodic memories of the event that was the lesson, but not actually the stuff you actually wanted them to remember. Yeah, I thought the aside you make in the article about this being one of the reasons why school transitions are difficult for students was really interesting, that many of those cues are all of a sudden missing. And that makes it hard for them to actually remember what they were supposed to have learned. Yeah, I mean, that's what happens is that, I mean, ultimately, when a memory is really, really secure and it's really firmly in the semantic memory, that's less necessary. But, you know, it's not like they're in one type and then they're in the other. There's a sort of transition between the two. That the student is still relying on quite a lot of contextual cues and not aware that they are. But you move the student even to just a different classroom down the hall, you know, and they don't remember it as much. But let alone if you move them from, you know, I don't know, come and be your assistant junior high to high or whatever it is, then or from high school to university, whatever, then so much of the context is different in terms of the rooms and the people and who they're with and their friends. It's really appreciated how much whatever it was they knew was packaged within in a bundle with all those context clues. So remove the context and what they knew sort of evaporates. It's quite volatile. So let's turn then to the implications for classroom practice. How can educators best produce semantic memory? Well, what you need to do is make sure that you're making your students think hard about whatever it is you want them to remember. Which sounds really obvious, but quite often if we really dissect our lesson practice, we might be directing them to think hard about something else, like getting on with your peers, which is obviously a valuable thing to do if that's what you want them to learn. But if you, you know, actually that's not the whole point of a lesson. It's to add fractions or learn the capitals of Western Europe or whatever, then that's what they need to think about. So it's about making sure lesson design gets them to think hard about what you want them to learn and not be diverted by unintentionally sabotaging the learning by getting them to focus on sort of complicated practical stuff. So for example, if we want students to learn something in science, then if they're doing an experiment, then what they will remember is the physical doing of the experiment. Now, there's a time and a place for that. It's not like never do experiments. But if what we thought was, I want them to know about friction, and we thought, well, we'll do this experiment, which will demonstrate friction, and then we'll know about friction. Probably they won't. Probably they'll remember, oh, yeah, we got up to different surfaces, and we got some carpet, and we got some lino, and we got some glass, and we put the car on. And they'll remember the stuff, the doing bit, but they won't remember, oh, yeah, and that's called friction, and a glass has less friction than the carpet. That bit will be lost, probably. I mean, this is on balance. It's not like a one-to-one correlation that will always work. But if you're betting and having a good bet, they're much more likely to remember what friction is if you get them to think hard about friction rather than doing an experiment to test it. That doesn't mean you don't want to do the experiment as well. It's just being aware of that so that when you plan, you are aware that the practical stuff isn't going to result in memory, so I need to balance that in some other way. At a minimum, it's suggested to me your discussion that the experiment should come after the concept has been taught in a more traditional manner, perhaps as a way of trying to create an additional episodic memory to reinforce what had been learned otherwise. Yeah, well, that's true. I mean, again, I'm not saying, I'm not being completely fundamentalist about this and saying never, never, never do it first. But generally, I think if you're trying to have a really safe bet, I'd say teach the stuff first and then reinforce it in a different context, which we know is good. Because if we're doing it in different contexts, then it's not overly tied to one context because that makes it too episodic. Do it in a different context. And if it's something, we also know that emotional events are also remembered, but they're remembered for the emotion rather than the thing itself. But that doesn't mean we can't use emotion to cement something that's already there. So, yeah, say using our example of friction, I'd say I would teach it first and then then do the experiment. So then press it there. I'll do a caveat to that. I'd say, you know, this is when we're planning, say, scientific curriculum development. Let's look. It's not just what I do in my classroom now, but maybe if I go, you know what, when they're four or five and they're really young, let's also get them experimenting with cars and different surfaces in a sort of episodic way as well. And so we can pick them up in when they're 10 or whatever age it is that when they're learning about friction. So that's sort of they've had that sort of embodied experience way back when. Then we're going to teach them about it. And then we're going to go back and do the practical thing again so that we can consolidate what they've learned. So trying to bring all the bits of memory in together, working together, but just getting the order right. Another implication you draw in the article is the potential value of revisiting concepts multiple times once they've been taught once. I read it as something of a defense of cycling in the curriculum. Why might that be the case? Well, there's a phenomenon called retrieval practice. Now, this is a concept that's really robust in the scientific literature. It's decades and decades old. And again, it's one of those sort of counterintuitive things that you wouldn't think of. But actually, what makes a memory stronger is the act of refinding it. So when you rubble around in your long-term memory for that memory, it's the act of finding it, finding something you've sort of half forgotten that will make that memory stronger. So in a way, that makes sense because, you know, your brain remembers so much stuff. And if you don't think about it, I suppose your brain goes, hey, that's not that interesting. Obviously, it doesn't want me to remember that well and bungs it on the back shelf somewhere of your long-term memory, if I can use that metaphor. If you think about it and then your brain has to go and find it, and bring it back into your working memory, then your brain goes, oh, oh, she wants me to remember this stuff. And so that memory gets stronger. So that's called the retrieval effect. The act of retrieval makes memory stronger. So that being the case, when we teach something, it's not enough just to teach and go, oh, we're good to go. They've got friction now. Then what you also need to do is maybe a week later when you've moved on and you're doing, I don't know, gravity, then you're going to go, hey, remember this other force, friction? Or not even say, do you remember, because then you're priming them. Just give them a little pop quiz about friction so that you have to rubble around their memory and find that. And then, so that's a week later, and then maybe three weeks later, maybe two months later, maybe a term later, a year later, two years later. You keep on coming back, just briefly, but crucially, you're not going to tell them. You're going to ask them, so they have to do the work of looking. Because it's that work of looking, that retrieval, that primes the memory to get stronger.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 2.04, "text": " article is an excerpt from a new book,", "seek": 0.0,

just published by John Catt International. And if our website traffic is any indication, the excerpt seems to have struck a chord with readers. The myth you set out to bust is that memorable events provide the template for creating memorable lessons. And you argue that the key to understanding why that's a myth is to recognize that there are two different types of memory. So what are those types of memory and how do they differ? Yeah, I mean, as you said, it's really understandable why any of us would think that, but it's based in a misunderstanding about these two types of memory. So we have these two types of memory. We have episodic memory. So if you think about the words episode, episodic, it's that's our autobiographical memory, the memory of our everyday memory that just happens. You don't consciously think, oh, what did I have for breakfast? What did I have for lunch? You just know that stuff. You just sort of remember it. But it's a very sort of easy come, easy go kind of memory. So you'll remember what you had for lunch, you know, yesterday maybe or a couple of days ago. But if I said, what did you have for lunch on March the 19th? Yeah, you probably don't remember. It's very unlikely to remember. So that's episodic memory. And then the other kind of memory is semantic memory. And that's memory that is more tightly organized and it takes effort. So you need to sort of think about things in order to actually remember them in your semantic memory. One thing you could think about is, you know, if you're being driven around somewhere, like maybe when you were a kid, you didn't really attend to how you got somewhere. So you may, if it's a journey did lots, you may remember, you may not. You're driving yourself and you actually have to remember the route. That's when you actually attended to it and you actually remembered it. So yeah, semantic memory takes conscious effort to remember. Episodic doesn't really at all. And you argue that ultimately what schools are trying to do, despite the fact that much of what we consciously remember about our schooling experience is episodic in nature, what schools are actually trying to do is to produce semantic memories. Is that right? Yeah. I mean, there's nothing wrong with episodic memory. It's not like a bad thing. It's just not so useful in terms of doing the things that schools want students to be able to do, which is to leave at the end, ultimately able to think critically and creatively about stuff. And in order to do that, we need to build semantic memory. And the reason why that's superior for those kinds of tasks is because it's much more flexible and transferable than episodic. And if I can just explain why that is with your episodic memories, they're very tagged with your, with contextual cues. So you remember, if you're remembering something, you remember all sorts of other things that go with that, like where you were, what the noises were, who you were with, how hot it was, et cetera, et cetera. So because it's tagged with those contextual cues, then in order to remember it, you generally need those contextual cues to remember it. Or sometimes you remember the contextual cues rather than the actual thing. And anyone who's taught anyone will probably be really familiar with this, that you teach a lesson and then the next day you say, hey, do you remember what we were learning yesterday? And the students will tell you all sorts of things about the context of the lesson, like, hey, we were using scissors or Marty was late or it was really hot or you knocked your coffee over. Yeah, all those things happen. What about the stuff I was teaching you? And they can't remember that. And that's because they've got episodic memories of the event that was the lesson, but not actually the stuff you actually wanted them to remember. Yeah, I thought the aside you make in the article about this being one of the reasons why school transitions are difficult for students was really interesting, that many of those cues are all of a sudden missing. And that makes it hard for them to actually remember what they were supposed to have learned. Yeah, I mean, that's what happens is that, I mean, ultimately, when a memory is really, really secure and it's really firmly in the semantic memory, that's less necessary. But, you know, it's not like they're in one type and then they're in the other. There's a sort of transition between the two. That the student is still relying on quite a lot of contextual cues and not aware that they are. But you move the student even to just a different classroom down the hall, you know, and they don't remember it as much. But let alone if you move them from, you know, I don't know, come and be your assistant junior high to high or whatever it is, then or from high school to university, whatever, then so much of the context is different in terms of the rooms and the people and who they're with and their friends. It's really appreciated how much whatever it was they knew was packaged within in a bundle with all those context clues. So remove the context and what they knew sort of evaporates. It's quite volatile. So let's turn then to the implications for classroom practice. How can educators best produce semantic memory? Well, what you need to do is make sure that you're making your students think hard about whatever it is you want them to remember. Which sounds really obvious, but quite often if we really dissect our lesson practice, we might be directing them to think hard about something else, like getting on with your peers, which is obviously a valuable thing to do if that's what you want them to learn. But if you, you know, actually that's not the whole point of a lesson. It's to add fractions or learn the capitals of Western Europe or whatever, then that's what they need to think about. So it's about making sure lesson design gets them to think hard about what you want them to learn and not be diverted by unintentionally sabotaging the learning by getting them to focus on sort of complicated practical stuff. So for example, if we want students to learn something in science, then if they're doing an experiment, then what they will remember is the physical doing of the experiment. Now, there's a time and a place for that. It's not like never do experiments. But if what we thought was, I want them to know about friction, and we thought, well, we'll do this experiment, which will demonstrate friction, and then we'll know about friction. Probably they won't. Probably they'll remember, oh, yeah, we got up to different surfaces, and we got some carpet, and we got some lino, and we got some glass, and we put the car on. And they'll remember the stuff, the doing bit, but they won't remember, oh, yeah, and that's called friction, and a glass has less friction than the carpet. That bit will be lost, probably. I mean, this is on balance. It's not like a one-to-one correlation that will always work. But if you're betting and having a good bet, they're much more likely to remember what friction is if you get them to think hard about friction rather than doing an experiment to test it. That doesn't mean you don't want to do the experiment as well. It's just being aware of that so that when you plan, you are aware that the practical stuff isn't going to result in memory, so I need to balance that in some other way. At a minimum, it's suggested to me your discussion that the experiment should come after the concept has been taught in a more traditional manner, perhaps as a way of trying to create an additional episodic memory to reinforce what had been learned otherwise. Yeah, well, that's true. I mean, again, I'm not saying, I'm not being completely fundamentalist about this and saying never, never, never do it first. But generally, I think if you're trying to have a really safe bet, I'd say teach the stuff first and then reinforce it in a different context, which we know is good. Because if we're doing it in different contexts, then it's not overly tied to one context because that makes it too episodic. Do it in a different context. And if it's something, we also know that emotional events are also remembered, but they're remembered for the emotion rather than the thing itself. But that doesn't mean we can't use emotion to cement something that's already there. So, yeah, say using our example of friction, I'd say I would teach it first and then then do the experiment. So then press it there. I'll do a caveat to that. I'd say, you know, this is when we're planning, say, scientific curriculum development. Let's look. It's not just what I do in my classroom now, but maybe if I go, you know what, when they're four or five and they're really young, let's also get them experimenting with cars and different surfaces in a sort of episodic way as well. And so we can pick them up in when they're 10 or whatever age it is that when they're learning about friction. So that's sort of they've had that sort of embodied experience way back when. Then we're going to teach them about it. And then we're going to go back and do the practical thing again so that we can consolidate what they've learned. So trying to bring all the bits of memory in together, working together, but just getting the order right. Another implication you draw in the article is the potential value of revisiting concepts multiple times once they've been taught once. I read it as something of a defense of cycling in the curriculum. Why might that be the case? Well, there's a phenomenon called retrieval practice. Now, this is a concept that's really robust in the scientific literature. It's decades and decades old. And again, it's one of those sort of counterintuitive things that you wouldn't think of. But actually, what makes a memory stronger is the act of refinding it. So when you rubble around in your long-term memory for that memory, it's the act of finding it, finding something you've sort of half forgotten that will make that memory stronger. So in a way, that makes sense because, you know, your brain remembers so much stuff. And if you don't think about it, I suppose your brain goes, hey, that's not that interesting. Obviously, it doesn't want me to remember that well and bungs it on the back shelf somewhere of your long-term memory, if I can use that metaphor. If you think about it and then your brain has to go and find it, and bring it back into your working memory, then your brain goes, oh, oh, she wants me to remember this stuff. And so that memory gets stronger. So that's called the retrieval effect. The act of retrieval makes memory stronger. So that being the case, when we teach something, it's not enough just to teach and go, oh, we're good to go. They've got friction now. Then what you also need to do is maybe a week later when you've moved on and you're doing, I don't know, gravity, then you're going to go, hey, remember this other force, friction? Or not even say, do you remember, because then you're priming them. Just give them a little pop quiz about friction so that you have to rubble around their memory and find that. And then, so that's a week later, and then maybe three weeks later, maybe two months later, maybe a term later, a year later, two years later. You keep on coming back, just briefly, but crucially, you're not going to tell them. You're going to ask them, so they have to do the work of looking. Because it's that work of looking, that retrieval, that primes the memory to get stronger.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.44, "text": " article is an excerpt from a new book, the Research Ed Guide to Education Myths, just published by", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [7222, 307, 364, 42760, 662, 490, 257, 777, 1446, 11, 264, 10303, 3977, 18727, 281, 10680, 26371, 82, 11, 445, 6572, 538], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.062153269735614906, "compression_ratio": 1.552, "no_speech_prob": 0.05260416492819786, "words": [{"word": " article", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.24, "probability": 0.6893854737281799, "tokens": [7222]}, {"word": " is", "start": 0.24, "end": 0.6, "probability": 0.9980372786521912, "tokens": [307]}, {"word": " an", "start": 0.6, "end": 0.78, "probability": 0.9987332224845886, "tokens": [364]}, {"word": " excerpt", "start": 0.78, "end": 1.28, "probability": 0.9999193549156189, "tokens": [42760, 662]}, {"word": " from", "start": 1.28, "end": 1.48, "probability": 0.9994797110557556, "tokens": [490]}, {"word": " a", "start": 1.48, "end": 1.58, "probability": 0.998062789440155, "tokens": [257]}, {"word": " new", "start": 1.58, "end": 1.74, "probability": 0.9995194673538208, "tokens": [777]}, {"word": " book,", "start": 1.74, "end": 2.04, "probability": 0.9998453855514526, "tokens": [1446, 11]}, {"word": " the", "start": 2.2, "end": 2.3, "probability": 0.6920020580291748, "tokens": [264]}, {"word": " Research", "start": 2.32, "end": 3.02, "probability": 0.8113570213317871, "tokens": [10303]}, {"word": " Ed", "start": 3.02, "end": 3.38, "probability": 0.9666297435760498, "tokens": [3977]}, {"word": " Guide", "start": 3.38, "end": 3.66, "probability": 0.9498932361602783, "tokens": [18727]}, {"word": " to", "start": 3.66, "end": 3.9, "probability": 0.9991395473480225, "tokens": [281]}, {"word": " Education", "start": 4.0, "end": 4.4, "probability": 0.9991212487220764, "tokens": [10680]}, {"word": " Myths,", "start": 4.4, "end": 5.0, "probability": 0.9983215034008026, "tokens": [26371, 82, 11]}, {"word": " just", "start": 5.68, "end": 5.78, "probability": 0.9990910291671753, "tokens": [445]}, {"word": " published", "start": 5.78, "end": 6.2, "probability": 0.9999042749404907, "tokens": [6572]}, {"word": " by", "start": 6.2, "end": 6.44, "probability": 0.9999649524688721, "tokens": [538]}]}, {"id": 1, "start": 6.44, "end": 12.92, "text": " John Catt International.
