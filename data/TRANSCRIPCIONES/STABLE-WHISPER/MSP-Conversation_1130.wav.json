{"text": " The current political climate, heightened terror alerts and escalated tension in Australia following counter-terrorism raids, has in fact contributed to an increase in racial abuse, in particular towards Muslim women. How would you describe the rate of incidents that have transpired in Australia? And that, of course, is bearing in mind that a large number of incidents go unreported. I don't have the exact figures as far as reporting goes, but I certainly agree with you that it's a vastly under-reported issue. We're very mindful and very concerned about the fact that Muslim women in particular have been harassed, intimidated. There are some instances where they've been spat upon by simply walking down the street and getting along with their daily lives. That's obviously a concern for us. You know, we've had many meetings with the community and the community leaders, together with the leadership, I would put, such as the Muslim Women's Association. And we've continually reinforced the need that women need to have confidence in the police. They need to have confidence in reporting to us. You know, there appears to be quite a discrepancy between the reporting on social media compared to what's actually reported to us. It makes it very hard for us to get a handle on what's accurate, you know, and get an understanding of the rate of incidents, you know, if at all. What I need to stress to the community is have confidence in your police. You know, we are getting a better understanding of the community issues. You know, we've worked tirelessly, particularly over the last several months, to engage and get a better understanding. You know, we can't do it alone and we keep saying that. Have confidence in your police because that's exactly who we are. We represent you and we're there to service your needs, including if you can't walk down the street or there's circumstances when people have been aggressive to you, whether they've spoken with rude language, whether they've spat upon you, those types of things we can't put up with. We simply can't condone and we won't. But let me encourage everyone, please, if you are subjected to that type of behaviour, you must report it to the police. Give us an opportunity to help you and give us an opportunity to work through these issues to try and stamp it out. Yes, that's definitely correct. It's all about a collaborative effort by the entire community as a whole, working together to ensure that the message is clear and the message is available. Now, Superintendent, dealing with an incident of racial abuse can be quite terrifying, especially for women who encounter such an incident. How is the person encouraged? How is the person encouraged to respond during a racial attack and sometimes even when it's involving threats of violence? What I would urge the listeners to do is not respond to the person who is trying to engage with you in such a negative and destructive way. Ignore them as best you can. Take some shelter. If it's on a public street and it's near shops, go inside the shop. Seek some type of shelter from the abuse. And report to the police straight away. If you're being intimidated, ring triple zero. The police will respond as quickly as we can, but you do not, please do not, suffer this abuse. I cannot stress that highly enough. If you're in a public space, if it might be the railway station, seek shelter within the railway station. If it's a shopping centre, seek shelter, again, away from the public space. Go somewhere you feel safe. And I guess it's a very unfortunate indictment of the community at the moment that women particularly can't walk down the street and feel that they can't walk down safely. Not only are we responsible for dealing with actual incidents of crime, but one of our main responsibilities is dealing with the perception of fear. Now, something doesn't necessarily have to happen for people to feel unsafe or have that raised fear. That's something that we need to address. Now, that may well be simply through a heightened police presence, sometimes people see police, they think something's gone wrong. A lot of the times, one of our main strategies is making sure we have a visible presence in the community just to reassure the community and reduce that level of fear. So just because you see uniformed police doesn't mean something's happened. We're actually out and about making sure something doesn't happen and providing that safety, that security, that feeling you can walk down the street quite safely is really important to us. That is absolutely important. And if it does help women and if it does diffuse any type of fear, then I'm sure the police will make sure to comply with that. Now, we touched on this briefly before, and I understand that police take all reports of racist attacks very seriously. And their goal is to alleviate fear in the community regarding incidents motivated by racism. But how do we convince and reassure those who have a fear of reporting or think there is no point or benefit in reporting to the police? I guess it's about the police convincing the community that we're there for them. It's a very strong community sense of the police as part of the community. We're working very hard to try and continue to break down those barriers. In actual fact, we have a specific section within the New South Wales Police Force that deals with what we term bias-motivated crimes. And when someone is abused or intimidated or assaulted or subjected to unfair treatment, it might be a handicap or a disability, that's what we term a bias-motivated crime. And we take that very, very seriously. I do understand that people have come from lands where authority is viewed in less than a positive light. I understand that. I get that. What I'm trying to stress is, that we're not like that. We have worked very hard in the areas of customs service. We've worked very hard in the areas of victim follow-up. I'm urging the listeners in the community to have confidence in their police and give us the opportunity to work for them and prove that we're not like the authority figures back home. In actual fact, we do care, and we do care very much about our community. Of course. And we should also stress to people that by reporting it, you may be able to prevent these incidents from happening to someone else. So your reporting plays a fundamental role in gathering data to ensure that such an incident wouldn't happen to someone else. Now, what is the timeframe within which complaints or reports can be lodged? There's no timeframe. If something happened to you a week ago, if something happened to you a month ago and you feel it was significant, please report it. A lot of our activities, a lot of our strategic direction is based upon the incidents of reported crime. How we forecast our policing activities, how we know to be in the right areas at the right time is based on our prediction, but part of that main data that we use is previous incidents. So if we have an issue or a spate of certain types of crimes happening in an area, we know we can work out the general time, the general place that these things have been prevalent, and then we can overlay our resources to try and address those issues. We try and be one step ahead of the crime or the unsavoury type of behaviour. Now, if we don't have that data to base that forecasting on, it makes it very hard. And we try and use a science about it. It's not so much guesswork, but we rely on the information provided by the community to allow us to try and predict accurately where and when we need to be. So I can see that gathering accurate data is of value to the police. Now, we also know that bystanders can play a critical role in standing up to racism when it occurs. What would you also recommend to those who are ever to witness a particular incident involving racial vilification or abuse to do? What you say is quite true. It can be an extremely traumatic experience to be subjected to that type of abuse. The last thing you'll focus on is the sort of information that we would consider vital. If you happen to see one of these incidents, whether it's someone being assaulted, whether it's someone being intimidated or subjected to clearly racial or cultural or religious abuse, take note. Take note what they look like, what they're wearing, how old they are, what sort of car they're in, and particularly the registration of that vehicle. And have confidence in that. Confidence in that information is vital to police. And have confidence in passing it on. If you are walking down the street and you see someone being physically assaulted, particularly a woman, try and take the steps as best you can to try and protect that person. And I'm not saying engage in a physical confrontation with the attacker. I'm saying try and, as best you can, intercede and provide some level of protection to that person who's being subjected to that abuse without exposing yourself as best you can to any heightened level of danger. But please, as soon as you see that incident, the first thing you need to do is ring triple zero. What you can do as safely as you can for yourself. But ringing the police is your first priority. Offering some type of assistance to that, particularly in the circumstance of a woman. Offering what sort of assistance you can to alleviate her predicament. Sometimes people don't want to get involved. But at the very least, please ring triple zero and allow us to come and take charge of that situation.", "segments": [{"start": 0.14, "end": 1.9, "text": " The current political climate,", "seek":

escalated tension in Australia following counter-terrorism raids, has in fact contributed to an increase in racial abuse, in particular towards Muslim women. How would you describe the rate of incidents that have transpired in Australia? And that, of course, is bearing in mind that a large number of incidents go unreported. I don't have the exact figures as far as reporting goes, but I certainly agree with you that it's a vastly under-reported issue. We're very mindful and very concerned about the fact that Muslim women in particular have been harassed, intimidated. There are some instances where they've been spat upon by simply walking down the street and getting along with their daily lives. That's obviously a concern for us. You know, we've had many meetings with the community and the community leaders, together with the leadership, I would put, such as the Muslim Women's Association. And we've continually reinforced the need that women need to have confidence in the police. They need to have confidence in reporting to us. You know, there appears to be quite a discrepancy between the reporting on social media compared to what's actually reported to us. It makes it very hard for us to get a handle on what's accurate, you know, and get an understanding of the rate of incidents, you know, if at all. What I need to stress to the community is have confidence in your police. You know, we are getting a better understanding of the community issues. You know, we've worked tirelessly, particularly over the last several months, to engage and get a better understanding. You know, we can't do it alone and we keep saying that. Have confidence in your police because that's exactly who we are. We represent you and we're there to service your needs, including if you can't walk down the street or there's circumstances when people have been aggressive to you, whether they've spoken with rude language, whether they've spat upon you, those types of things we can't put up with. We simply can't condone and we won't. But let me encourage everyone, please, if you are subjected to that type of behaviour, you must report it to the police. Give us an opportunity to help you and give us an opportunity to work through these issues to try and stamp it out. Yes, that's definitely correct. It's all about a collaborative effort by the entire community as a whole, working together to ensure that the message is clear and the message is available. Now, Superintendent, dealing with an incident of racial abuse can be quite terrifying, especially for women who encounter such an incident. How is the person encouraged? How is the person encouraged to respond during a racial attack and sometimes even when it's involving threats of violence? What I would urge the listeners to do is not respond to the person who is trying to engage with you in such a negative and destructive way. Ignore them as best you can. Take some shelter. If it's on a public street and it's near shops, go inside the shop. Seek some type of shelter from the abuse. And report to the police straight away. If you're being intimidated, ring triple zero. The police will respond as quickly as we can, but you do not, please do not, suffer this abuse. I cannot stress that highly enough. If you're in a public space, if it might be the railway station, seek shelter within the railway station. If it's a shopping centre, seek shelter, again, away from the public space. Go somewhere you feel safe. And I guess it's a very unfortunate indictment of the community at the moment that women particularly can't walk down the street and feel that they can't walk down safely. Not only are we responsible for dealing with actual incidents of crime, but one of our main responsibilities is dealing with the perception of fear. Now, something doesn't necessarily have to happen for people to feel unsafe or have that raised fear. That's something that we need to address. Now, that may well be simply through a heightened police presence, sometimes people see police, they think something's gone wrong. A lot of the times, one of our main strategies is making sure we have a visible presence in the community just to reassure the community and reduce that level of fear. So just because you see uniformed police doesn't mean something's happened. We're actually out and about making sure something doesn't happen and providing that safety, that security, that feeling you can walk down the street quite safely is really important to us. That is absolutely important. And if it does help women and if it does diffuse any type of fear, then I'm sure the police will make sure to comply with that. Now, we touched on this briefly before, and I understand that police take all reports of racist attacks very seriously. And their goal is to alleviate fear in the community regarding incidents motivated by racism. But how do we convince and reassure those who have a fear of reporting or think there is no point or benefit in reporting to the police? I guess it's about the police convincing the community that we're there for them. It's a very strong community sense of the police as part of the community. We're working very hard to try and continue to break down those barriers. In actual fact, we have a specific section within the New South Wales Police Force that deals with what we term bias-motivated crimes. And when someone is abused or intimidated or assaulted or subjected to unfair treatment, it might be a handicap or a disability, that's what we term a bias-motivated crime. And we take that very, very seriously. I do understand that people have come from lands where authority is viewed in less than a positive light. I understand that. I get that. What I'm trying to stress is, that we're not like that. We have worked very hard in the areas of customs service. We've worked very hard in the areas of victim follow-up. I'm urging the listeners in the community to have confidence in their police and give us the opportunity to work for them and prove that we're not like the authority figures back home. In actual fact, we do care, and we do care very much about our community. Of course. And we should also stress to people that by reporting it, you may be able to prevent these incidents from happening to someone else. So your reporting plays a fundamental role in gathering data to ensure that such an incident wouldn't happen to someone else. Now, what is the timeframe within which complaints or reports can be lodged? There's no timeframe. If something happened to you a week ago, if something happened to you a month ago and you feel it was significant, please report it. A lot of our activities, a lot of our strategic direction is based upon the incidents of reported crime. How we forecast our policing activities, how we know to be in the right areas at the right time is based on our prediction, but part of that main data that we use is previous incidents. So if we have an issue or a spate of certain types of crimes happening in an area, we know we can work out the general time, the general place that these things have been prevalent, and then we can overlay our resources to try and address those issues. We try and be one step ahead of the crime or the unsavoury type of behaviour. Now, if we don't have that data to base that forecasting on, it makes it very hard. And we try and use a science about it. It's not so much guesswork, but we rely on the information provided by the community to allow us to try and predict accurately where and when we need to be. So I can see that gathering accurate data is of value to the police. Now, we also know that bystanders can play a critical role in standing up to racism when it occurs. What would you also recommend to those who are ever to witness a particular incident involving racial vilification or abuse to do? What you say is quite true. It can be an extremely traumatic experience to be subjected to that type of abuse. The last thing you'll focus on is the sort of information that we would consider vital. If you happen to see one of these incidents, whether it's someone being assaulted, whether it's someone being intimidated or subjected to clearly racial or cultural or religious abuse, take note. Take note what they look like, what they're wearing, how old they are, what sort of car they're in, and particularly the registration of that vehicle. And have confidence in that. Confidence in that information is vital to police. And have confidence in passing it on. If you are walking down the street and you see someone being physically assaulted, particularly a woman, try and take the steps as best you can to try and protect that person. And I'm not saying engage in a physical confrontation with the attacker. I'm saying try and, as best you can, intercede and provide some level of protection to that person who's being subjected to that abuse without exposing yourself as best you can to any heightened level of danger. But please, as soon as you see that incident, the first thing you need to do is ring triple zero. What you can do as safely as you can for yourself. But ringing the police is your first priority. Offering some type of assistance to that, particularly in the circumstance of a woman. Offering what sort of assistance you can to alleviate her predicament. Sometimes people don't want to get involved. But at the very least, please ring triple zero and allow us to come and take charge of that situation.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.14, "end": 16.58, "text": " The current political climate,
