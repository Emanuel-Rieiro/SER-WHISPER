{"text": " So there I was walking and then this tow truck drove up next to me. And it was three guys sitting in the front. And the one guy on the passenger seat, as it slowed down, started talking to me, asking me, where are you going? And I just pointed to the front. Where are you coming from? Just pointed to the back, like coming from back there, you know, and really not entertaining the conversation. And his two friends in the car kind of started egging him on, saying, ah, Antoine, you're going to let her talk to you like that. And they stopped and I thought, okay, it's over. Let me just get home. Whatever. And then I heard the door close and the guy had come out. The one that had been talking to me, I jumped out of the car and started chasing. Immediately I knew to run. Started running, started, then he was chasing me. And then he tripped me and there I was on the ground fighting with this person whose face I cannot even recall. And the other guys in the car also rolled up quite slowly and I'm battling with him, fighting with him as he was trying to get me into the car. And I think in that struggle, I must have kicked him where the sun doesn't shine. And that's when he retreated. But at the same time, a neighbor had come out, you know, just shouting out to say, what is going on there? And that's when they drove off. That is how I managed in my teenage years to escape this terrible pattern and trend that existed called jackrolling. And when I got home, speaking to my brother, speaking to other family members, people as they tried to comfort you and reassure you that now you're safe and everything, realized that it had happened to four other women, other girls in my network. Four other people. One of them, it was a successful jackroll. And the other three had escaped it in a combination or in a number of other ways. But just the threat and the sense of not feeling safe in your community, in your environment. Had always stayed with me. So even walking through town and even now in everything that you do, you're kind of always aware that there's the constant threat that you might become a victim of sexual assault. Our public spaces are not safe for women. And when we talk rape and when we looked at when we look at the stats, the statistician general Padilohotla released stats where he was reflecting on how prevalent it is in South Africa and also that it happens. The perpetrators are often people that the victim knows. It might not be an intimate partner, but so often it's also people that, you know, in your community, you know, people who are terrorizing the community. I remember Jeff Brown, people like Tebochom Rembole for those that maybe grew up in that era in Soweto particularly. But it would be these gangs or groups that you are aware of. You know, on a lucky day, you would just have a hello, hello. And that's the end of it. But on an unlucky day, it could develop into something, something even more dangerous. So gang rape is not just at the hands of strangers, but can also happen at the hands of people. That you are familiar with. So that's what we're exploring. It's prevalence. It's characteristics, how it affects the way women move around and inhabit community spaces. And gang rape is distinctive because although it is a situation in which no brutality or no threat even would be necessary to subdue the victim, it is sadistic and it happens on quite a scale. So that is what we're looking at. And I wondered about other women as well. Your level of safety, how you feel when you move through spaces. Do you feel safe? You know, and the people that you interact with, have some of them turned out to be that threat? And let's also be fair to say that and reflect the reality because it doesn't just happen to women. You know, I have a number of friends who belong to the LGBTIQ community. They've also been targets in the past of this similar kind of situation. So this is what we'll be exploring. And I do welcome your calls, your thoughts on 011-883-0702. This phenomenon of gang rapes, of jackrolling, and how it's also been referred to the other hybrids of it or references to it like streamlining and the other more colloquial local terms. But in essence, it is the abduction and the rape of a victim. We've got Professor Rachel Jukes joining us now. And she's the director at the Gender Health Unit at the South African Research Council. Prof, thank you so much for your time on this very, very disturbing issue. Well, thank you for inviting me, Azaria. So according to the research that has been done and our understanding of course of rape as we try to really get to the heart of why these kinds of crimes happen, what are some of the characteristics that you can tell us about gang rape and the gangs and the relationship or exchanges amongst those that belong to these gangs? Well, I think in a way that your sort of incredibly poignant personal story sort of highlights some of the issues that we deal with with gang rape. And it does make it slightly different from rape that's carried out by one person as an individual. Because there are two things that I can bring out from your story. The first is that it's very much a group act and it involves group bonding, but also sort of groups egging each other on. And I think that your story of talking about the way the other men in the car were sort of egging on the one who was initially talking to you and then persuading him to go after you highlights the fact that this is a male group sort of, you know, boys together, if you like, type activity. And the second thing is that it very often is carried out for fun, which is obviously, I think if you reflect back on your story about what would have been motivating those men at that time to be in a car, to be roaming around those streets, one would imagine to be looking for somebody who they might be able to rape. Because it does sound from your story like it's very likely that is what they were trying to do. It wasn't a total coincidence they started talking to you. And it's this idea in gang rape that this can be something which, you know, men, it's usually younger men. So men and adolescent boys come together and see as a way of, firstly, as entertainment, and secondly, as a way of, you know, entertainment, which cements bonds among the group who are involved. And obviously the consequences for women are really, really horrible. And at the most extreme, you know, women can die from being gang raped because of the injuries. And the psychological damage for women is absolutely phenomenal. But it is so, you know, it's so terrible, really, that within our society, we can have this situation where something which actually is carried out as a form of male entertainment can have such absolutely devastating consequences for women. Yeah, that's Professor Rachel Jukes. But we're also joined by Isaac Mangena, who wrote a piece some time back in the Mail and Guardian. And he's a former journalist. And now he's the head of communications at the South African Human Rights Commission. Now, Isaac, we wanted to talk to you because that piece was unforgettable, because you spoke of what you witnessed and what you saw to be really commonplace in Limpopo where you grew up. And this was after a Bram Fisherville teenager was gang raped in 2012. And you referred to something that was called Lebanda in Limpopo. Just briefly explain that. Yes, indeed. Thanks for the invite. Look, like any other South African at that time, after this 17-year-old disabled girl was gang raped, I was obviously horrified. And I was like, what is it? What is it that is going on in the minds of every person who can do such a heinous crime? But then I started to reflect back to my, you know, the same age as those boys were. I mean, there was one who was actually 18 years old and 12 and the oldest, I think he was 23. And I started to think about myself at that age. And if really we did have those kind of thoughts. And I realized that actually this is a phenomenon that has been going on for a long time. And I started to remember, you know, where I grew up, that we actually called this Lebanda, basically meaning the belt, which basically defines, you know, the number of guys who will sleep with one girl. And then I started kind of like reflecting as how it used to happen, basically. And indeed, it was an issue of peer pressure, issue of trying to fit in, issue of the older boys. It was basically inducting the younger boys into their groups, basically. If you wanted to be part of a certain group, you actually have to go through some of those initiations. And one of those would be you need to get a girl who we can actually sleep with, all of us. And it was something that was, at that time, you think that actually this is fun. This is, you know, it makes me feel like a man. And actually, boys will come to school and brag about it. They'll come to school and say, yo, this weekend, this is what we're going to do. We did, you know, this is this weekend. And you also get those who, even though they didn't, they'll just say it so that it is they, they get some respect to say, oh, shit, this is something that this person has done. And it's a very cool thing. It's interesting that you say that it was the older boys sort of inducting the younger boys. So it was seen to be part of what a rite of passage that this is the normal course of growing up. Yes, it was something like that. And you, like in my article, as you can see, I also reflected on the whole issue of Lepan, but in the olden days in 1950s and 60s, where it was, it was called check rolling. And you gave an example about yourself. And it was basically the check rolling was basically done by, by, by, by gangsters in the townships. The Musumi gang in, in, in, in, in Alexander Township were known for that basically. And it is, even though some girls knew up, knew, knew, knew, knew about what was happening, but you find that most of the time is a case of guys buying them alcohol. And then later, whether they know or whether they agree or they didn't agree, it just happens. And then for them, for, for, for, for, for those who get, who, who, who are involved in that are actually feeling now they belong, you know, now they, they've arrived and they've, they've passed that kind of passage that was put for them. So that is what, that is how the woman was targeted often with, with alcohol. Yeah. Often it would be with alcohol. At these taverns and plied with alcohol. Yes. It would often be with alcohol. It would often be with cigarettes or even to some extent, even though in my village, we didn't know about drugs, but to some extent you find that drugs are there. But also the example that you gave, it would be a situation where a girl, even though there were no cars, even when in, in groups, you just bump into a girl. Look, we'd not, we'd not live in this one. Let's take care. And then let's see. And then she's the arm. And then the girl will, will basically fall into place. And she won't even shout. She won't even do anything. And by that time, remember, you actually knew that the girl won't even go back home to say, this is what happened to me, because it's a case of what were you doing in the tavern at your age at 17 years old. And, and also the police stations were not even nearby. They were far. And the whole issue of stigma around the fact that actually slept with almost the whole soccer team was, was actually coming up there. And you actually feel that you don't even have to say anything about this. And even, even worse is that parents won't ask about certain, some of these issues. Actually, if, if, if you are unlucky, you'll be beaten. You'll be beaten for having been in the streets at night instead of being in the streets at night. And that's a big part of actually dealing with the issue that actually this, this young girl has just been getting raped. So I just, I just reflected when I saw that and that girl was actually disabled. And it, it, I started to realize that actually you find that for many who are unable to actually approach Azania or any other person, they will actually see those because of their physical disabilities as, as, as, as, as a target. Yeah. Isaac, thank you so much. Thank you for, for taking us back to that column and what you witnessed or what you grew up seeing, but thank you for that. Thanks. Thanks for having me. That's the head of communications at the SA Human Rights Commission. And also, by the way, Isaac himself never took part in Lebanda. We'll continue the conversation. I'll get Professor Rachel Jukes' reflections on what Isaac had to say after the two o'clock news, but we also welcome your calls. In the last 24 hours, 24 hours, what's happened in your world?

The agency is expected to publish a review of SA's debt rating on the third of next month. It's now released some advice in terms of what it'll be looking at. Saying South African authorities should not resort to quick fixes, like setting a minimum wage ahead of the local government elections in August. Jenna Kanaides has more. Fitch says there are several risks to the rating South Africa will receive next week. One of them mentioned is related to quick fixes in fiscal policy in the run-up to elections, which Fitch says will discourage investment. Finance Minister Pravin Gordon met with Fitch and Standard & Poor's last week, saying it's unclear at this stage whether the country's debt will be downgraded. Gordon and his team have been working hard to encourage investors in an effort to avoid the dreaded junk credit rating. Gia Nicolaides, Eyewitness News. Proudly South African products like Roybos Honeybush Tea and Karoo Lamb will now have their names protected in terms of an agreement concluded with the European Union. Minister and the Presidency Jeff Gadebe says Cabinet was briefed on the bilateral protocol on geographical indicators at its meeting yesterday.

And it was three guys sitting in the front. And the one guy on the passenger seat, as it slowed down, started talking to me, asking me, where are you going? And I just pointed to the front. Where are you coming from? Just pointed to the back, like coming from back there, you know, and really not entertaining the conversation. And his two friends in the car kind of started egging him on, saying, ah, Antoine, you're going to let her talk to you like that. And they stopped and I thought, okay, it's over. Let me just get home. Whatever. And then I heard the door close and the guy had come out. The one that had been talking to me, I jumped out of the car and started chasing. Immediately I knew to run. Started running, started, then he was chasing me. And then he tripped me and there I was on the ground fighting with this person whose face I cannot even recall. And the other guys in the car also rolled up quite slowly and I'm battling with him, fighting with him as he was trying to get me into the car. And I think in that struggle, I must have kicked him where the sun doesn't shine. And that's when he retreated. But at the same time, a neighbor had come out, you know, just shouting out to say, what is going on there? And that's when they drove off. That is how I managed in my teenage years to escape this terrible pattern and trend that existed called jackrolling. And when I got home, speaking to my brother, speaking to other family members, people as they tried to comfort you and reassure you that now you're safe and everything, realized that it had happened to four other women, other girls in my network. Four other people. One of them, it was a successful jackroll. And the other three had escaped it in a combination or in a number of other ways. But just the threat and the sense of not feeling safe in your community, in your environment. Had always stayed with me. So even walking through town and even now in everything that you do, you're kind of always aware that there's the constant threat that you might become a victim of sexual assault. Our public spaces are not safe for women. And when we talk rape and when we looked at when we look at the stats, the statistician general Padilohotla released stats where he was reflecting on how prevalent it is in South Africa and also that it happens. The perpetrators are often people that the victim knows. It might not be an intimate partner, but so often it's also people that, you know, in your community, you know, people who are terrorizing the community. I remember Jeff Brown, people like Tebochom Rembole for those that maybe grew up in that era in Soweto particularly. But it would be these gangs or groups that you are aware of. You know, on a lucky day, you would just have a hello, hello. And that's the end of it. But on an unlucky day, it could develop into something, something even more dangerous. So gang rape is not just at the hands of strangers, but can also happen at the hands of people. That you are familiar with. So that's what we're exploring. It's prevalence. It's characteristics, how it affects the way women move around and inhabit community spaces. And gang rape is distinctive because although it is a situation in which no brutality or no threat even would be necessary to subdue the victim, it is sadistic and it happens on quite a scale. So that is what we're looking at. And I wondered about other women as well. Your level of safety, how you feel when you move through spaces. Do you feel safe? You know, and the people that you interact with, have some of them turned out to be that threat? And let's also be fair to say that and reflect the reality because it doesn't just happen to women. You know, I have a number of friends who belong to the LGBTIQ community. They've also been targets in the past of this similar kind of situation. So this is what we'll be exploring. And I do welcome your calls, your thoughts on 011-883-0702. This phenomenon of gang rapes, of jackrolling, and how it's also been referred to the other hybrids of it or references to it like streamlining and the other more colloquial local terms. But in essence, it is the abduction and the rape of a victim. We've got Professor Rachel Jukes joining us now. And she's the director at the Gender Health Unit at the South African Research Council. Prof, thank you so much for your time on this very, very disturbing issue. Well, thank you for inviting me, Azaria. So according to the research that has been done and our understanding of course of rape as we try to really get to the heart of why these kinds of crimes happen, what are some of the characteristics that you can tell us about gang rape and the gangs and the relationship or exchanges amongst those that belong to these gangs? Well, I think in a way that your sort of incredibly poignant personal story sort of highlights some of the issues that we deal with with gang rape. And it does make it slightly different from rape that's carried out by one person as an individual. Because there are two things that I can bring out from your story. The first is that it's very much a group act and it involves group bonding, but also sort of groups egging each other on. And I think that your story of talking about the way the other men in the car were sort of egging on the one who was initially talking to you and then persuading him to go after you highlights the fact that this is a male group sort of, you know, boys together, if you like, type activity. And the second thing is that it very often is carried out for fun, which is obviously, I think if you reflect back on your story about what would have been motivating those men at that time to be in a car, to be roaming around those streets, one would imagine to be looking for somebody who they might be able to rape. Because it does sound from your story like it's very likely that is what they were trying to do. It wasn't a total coincidence they started talking to you. And it's this idea in gang rape that this can be something which, you know, men, it's usually younger men. So men and adolescent boys come together and see as a way of, firstly, as entertainment, and secondly, as a way of, you know, entertainment, which cements bonds among the group who are involved. And obviously the consequences for women are really, really horrible. And at the most extreme, you know, women can die from being gang raped because of the injuries. And the psychological damage for women is absolutely phenomenal. But it is so, you know, it's so terrible, really, that within our society, we can have this situation where something which actually is carried out as a form of male entertainment can have such absolutely devastating consequences for women. Yeah, that's Professor Rachel Jukes. But we're also joined by Isaac Mangena, who wrote a piece some time back in the Mail and Guardian. And he's a former journalist. And now he's the head of communications at the South African Human Rights Commission. Now, Isaac, we wanted to talk to you because that piece was unforgettable, because you spoke of what you witnessed and what you saw to be really commonplace in Limpopo where you grew up. And this was after a Bram Fisherville teenager was gang raped in 2012. And you referred to something that was called Lebanda in Limpopo. Just briefly explain that. Yes, indeed. Thanks for the invite. Look, like any other South African at that time, after this 17-year-old disabled girl was gang raped, I was obviously horrified. And I was like, what is it? What is it that is going on in the minds of every person who can do such a heinous crime? But then I started to reflect back to my, you know, the same age as those boys were. I mean, there was one who was actually 18 years old and 12 and the oldest, I think he was 23. And I started to think about myself at that age. And if really we did have those kind of thoughts. And I realized that actually this is a phenomenon that has been going on for a long time. And I started to remember, you know, where I grew up, that we actually called this Lebanda, basically meaning the belt, which basically defines, you know, the number of guys who will sleep with one girl. And then I started kind of like reflecting as how it used to happen, basically. And indeed, it was an issue of peer pressure, issue of trying to fit in, issue of the older boys. It was basically inducting the younger boys into their groups, basically. If you wanted to be part of a certain group, you actually have to go through some of those initiations. And one of those would be you need to get a girl who we can actually sleep with, all of us. And it was something that was, at that time, you think that actually this is fun. This is, you know, it makes me feel like a man. And actually, boys will come to school and brag about it. They'll come to school and say, yo, this weekend, this is what we're going to do. We did, you know, this is this weekend. And you also get those who, even though they didn't, they'll just say it so that it is they, they get some respect to say, oh, shit, this is something that this person has done. And it's a very cool thing. It's interesting that you say that it was the older boys sort of inducting the younger boys. So it was seen to be part of what a rite of passage that this is the normal course of growing up. Yes, it was something like that. And you, like in my article, as you can see, I also reflected on the whole issue of Lepan, but in the olden days in 1950s and 60s, where it was, it was called check rolling. And you gave an example about yourself. And it was basically the check rolling was basically done by, by, by, by gangsters in the townships. The Musumi gang in, in, in, in, in Alexander Township were known for that basically. And it is, even though some girls knew up, knew, knew, knew, knew about what was happening, but you find that most of the time is a case of guys buying them alcohol. And then later, whether they know or whether they agree or they didn't agree, it just happens. And then for them, for, for, for, for, for those who get, who, who, who are involved in that are actually feeling now they belong, you know, now they, they've arrived and they've, they've passed that kind of passage that was put for them. So that is what, that is how the woman was targeted often with, with alcohol. Yeah. Often it would be with alcohol. At these taverns and plied with alcohol. Yes. It would often be with alcohol. It would often be with cigarettes or even to some extent, even though in my village, we didn't know about drugs, but to some extent you find that drugs are there. But also the example that you gave, it would be a situation where a girl, even though there were no cars, even when in, in groups, you just bump into a girl. Look, we'd not, we'd not live in this one. Let's take care. And then let's see. And then she's the arm. And then the girl will, will basically fall into place. And she won't even shout. She won't even do anything. And by that time, remember, you actually knew that the girl won't even go back home to say, this is what happened to me, because it's a case of what were you doing in the tavern at your age at 17 years old. And, and also the police stations were not even nearby. They were far. And the whole issue of stigma around the fact that actually slept with almost the whole soccer team was, was actually coming up there. And you actually feel that you don't even have to say anything about this. And even, even worse is that parents won't ask about certain, some of these issues. Actually, if, if, if you are unlucky, you'll be beaten. You'll be beaten for having been in the streets at night instead of being in the streets at night. And that's a big part of actually dealing with the issue that actually this, this young girl has just been getting raped. So I just, I just reflected when I saw that and that girl was actually disabled. And it, it, I started to realize that actually you find that for many who are unable to actually approach Azania or any other person, they will actually see those because of their physical disabilities as, as, as, as, as a target. Yeah. Isaac, thank you so much. Thank you for, for taking us back to that column and what you witnessed or what you grew up seeing, but thank you for that. Thanks. Thanks for having me. That's the head of communications at the SA Human Rights Commission. And also, by the way, Isaac himself never took part in Lebanda. We'll continue the conversation. I'll get Professor Rachel Jukes' reflections on what Isaac had to say after the two o'clock news, but we also welcome your calls. In the last 24 hours, 24 hours, what's happened in your world?

The agency is expected to publish a review of SA's debt rating on the third of next month. It's now released some advice in terms of what it'll be looking at. Saying South African authorities should not resort to quick fixes, like setting a minimum wage ahead of the local government elections in August. Jenna Kanaides has more. Fitch says there are several risks to the rating South Africa will receive next week. One of them mentioned is related to quick fixes in fiscal policy in the run-up to elections, which Fitch says will discourage investment. Finance Minister Pravin Gordon met with Fitch and Standard & Poor's last week, saying it's unclear at this stage whether the country's debt will be downgraded. Gordon and his team have been working hard to encourage investors in an effort to avoid the dreaded junk credit rating. Gia Nicolaides, Eyewitness News.
