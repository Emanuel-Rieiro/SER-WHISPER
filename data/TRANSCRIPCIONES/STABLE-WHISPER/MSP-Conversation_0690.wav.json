{"text": " Welcome to Caps Lock and Cray, a podcast for serious criticism and serious feels. I'm your host, Avira, aka Caps Lock, and Cray's is Katie. Hi. And today we're going to talk about some just general news that's going on in the TV and film world. And then we're going to discuss the Mission Impossible series. Hell yeah. And particularly Rogue Nation, which was amazing. Amazing. So let's kick it off with some news. And what do you got for us today? All right. Well, all of my news is Star Wars based, so I hope you don't mind. I don't. This is where I get all my news about Star Wars is from you. So I just found out that the director of Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow, if that's how you pronounce it. Yeah. He's the director of Tomorrow. That's how you can remember his name. No. Is directing episode nine. Yes. That is the last one. Seven, eight, nine. Yes. Okay. And that makes me unhappy. As if you ever remembered the episode where we talked about Jurassic World, you'll know that I'm not a very big fan of him. And that movie had no flair whatsoever. Well, that really is a bummer. You know, the director of... So JJ's doing the next one, obviously. The first one. Yeah. The big one. Yeah. And then Rian Johnson, who directed Looper and Brick, is the next one after that. And then... That's a smart... You know, that's a good choice. Yeah. I'm fine with that. That's fine. It's an interesting choice. Now, I never saw Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not... What's it called? Safety Not Guaranteed, which, I mean, it does have time travel. So I should see it. But... That's not why he got the job. It's got Lindy Cred. Yes. No. Why he got the job is because he's directed one of the most box office success-y movies of our times, even though it's crap. I think his directing style is... Not a style. Safety Guaranteed. Oh. Get it? Yes. Because he makes standard movie that makes... A trillion million dollars. So that's not fun. And that's why they chose him, I think. Yeah. So that's part of my news. The other part is... Well, I guess it's the three-part Star Wars news. The second part being... I read an article from, like, a week or two ago that said that in Rogue One, Felicity Jones is rumored to be Boba Fett's daughter. Like, first she was, like, actually Leia. Aww. She's Boba Fett's daughter. I don't know what is going on there, and it's driving me crazy. But I read that, and I don't know if it's true. Or she is a bounty hunter, or the movie's about bounty hunters. I don't know. But if she is... Like, if this is all an attempt to just try to keep secret that she's Leia, is it... I don't think... She's no longer for sure she's not Leia. I don't... I don't think so. I mean, you saw a picture of her, right? Yeah. There's a photo release. Yeah, there was a photo release from it, like, a week or two ago that... Yeah. And she looks cool. And this is a prequel to actual Star Wars. Yes. So, yeah. And her hair looked real modern, not like... Not fun. Before 70s hair that they had. Yeah. No. But, yeah. So, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's going on there. And then, my third Star Wars news. This is just for me only. VR doesn't care about this whatsoever. But they also just announced at D23 that both Disneyland and... Hollywood Studios in Florida are getting a 14-acre Star Wars land expansion to the parks. So, like, an actual huge Star Wars land. And I am very excited. It's coming to Disney... Because we're all going to be able to go to the Mos Eisley Cantina Bar and drink. And it's going to be great. Wait, Disney World and Disneyland? Yeah, both. Both. Wow. And how long is that going to take? Forever. I saw a great tweet of this girl that I follow who was just like, I hope that they finish it before Florida is underwater. Oh, no. But, yeah. It's going to take forever, sure. Yeah. But that's exciting. Yeah. Once it's actually done. Like, I've always wanted, like, to go to the cantina. So, like, they could just do that first. And then I will be happy. I don't even need the rest of it. They could just have built the bar and I would be fine. I bet they're going to do it, like, in, you know, like, a little bit each. And then release. Yeah. Like, open that up. Yeah. And then just keep working on it some more. Yeah. Because they can't just, like, have a construction site for, like... A hundred years. Yeah. Yeah. Like... No, I know. Ten, twelve years or whatever. They did also just open a bar, the Indiana Jones Bar. So... And where? The Disney Springs, formerly Downtown Disney. Oh. So it's just, like, if you just go there, there's just that. Yeah. Well, no. There's lots of stuff there. But it's, like, part of, like, the new stuff. But that's open to, like... It's an empty space. You're going through all the big Harrison Ford movies. Bars are being built. Okay. Will you? What's your news? What you got? Well, my first news is from a little bit ago, which was the announcement that Annabeth Gish is going to be in the X-Files revival. And that is... Yeah. It deserves all the applause because I love her. And, you know, it's... It kind of bridges the whole world of the X-Files perfectly. I'm sure they'll get Robert Patrick as well because... Because out of the two, you would think, first, they would just get Robert Patrick. What if he's busy? I don't think he's busy. What is he doing? He's busy. Yeah, but he can't find, like, a little bit of time to just show up for a second. I don't know. I think he can. Okay. But maybe not. Who knows? Aren't they, like, done filming? So maybe not. Oh. Are they done? I thought it was from June to, like... No, I think we would have known if we ran... I thought it was, like, to the end of August. It's, like, right after their birthdays. Oh. I thought. I don't know if they were done. Why weren't they, like... Yeah. I don't think they're done yet. Well, maybe there's September. I'm not sure, but... You know what? If he's not in it, I don't care because she is. So there. I liked her more anyway. I liked Reyes. And I liked Doggett and Reyes. And... Yeah. It wasn't their... You know, I mean, the show at that point had been on for forever, and this is a bigger conversation. Every time... I feel like every time we bring up the X-Files, we're like, ooh, this is the thing for later. So we're going to have to do some kind of X-Files extravaganza. Okay, fine. But, yeah. I... Bottom line is we like them both a lot. Bottom line is if you like the X-Files, you like the, you know, the whole thing, and don't be a dick, and be like, well, if David Duchovny left, I'm not interested. Because guess what? Gillian Anderson was stuck there the whole time. So that means you favor him over her, and I hate you. Yeah. And you're wrong, and please get a new opinion. So... And because she was there, they did a great thing about introducing these two new people. Yeah. The integration of Doggett was incredible. Yeah, I liked it. And Reyes is just super fun. So great. And... I can't believe she tweeted about Whale Song. She did? Did you not see it? No. Okay, well, I'll show you later. Oh, my God. I'm speechless. I think there was a whale emoji. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. See, this is why she has to be in there. She's amazing. And so that was really exciting. And the second news was that because NBC had their TCAs, like, a couple days ago, they announced that the Xena reboot was actually a thing that was happening. So first, there was a... There was maybe a month ago, or a few weeks ago, some news being, like, a little burst of news about this being percolating and spreading around. And Lucy Lawless tweeted and said, guys, this is not happening. I would know. And then she tweeted that her husband yelled at her and said that she shouldn't say that. And then this was announced. So... Because her husband and Sam Raimi are involved. And... And... Yeah, that's exciting. That's really... I mean, I hope that Xena... Well, Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor... Xena and Gabrielle are involved with it. Yeah, that'd be good. I would hope. So, a plus to that. That makes me happy. Although, I don't know. NBC, I don't know about that. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, any... You don't have anything else? No. All my news is about Star Wars. Star Wars. Okay. All right. Let's just... Let's just talk about the Mission Impossible movies. Okay. You're kind of a little expert on them. You have made a vid. I have. Would you like to link to your vid? I will. Yeah. I made four Fester vids two years ago. Two years ago? Would you like to explain what Fester vids is? Oh, so... Sure. Okay. Fester vids in the vidding community is basically a holiday, a gift exchange where you sign up for a particular amount of fandoms that you are able to vid. And then you also write in, like... You offer a bunch of fandoms that you want. So, you then get matched up with someone who, like, you'll then make, like, a vid for. Yeah, they request... Based on what you request. Yeah, exactly. I'm only not finding the right words. Yeah, a request. Offers and requests. Yes. The correct words. So, yeah. So, a couple years ago, I had offered to do a Mission Impossible series, and that's what I got matched with, and so I made that. And at the time, it was the... The fourth? All four. Yeah. Yeah. Not this one, obviously. It just came out. And I think you should re-edit the thing or make a new one. No, I'll just make a new one. With all of it. Yeah. I don't know. I would like to just have her included. Once it's done, it's done. I don't want to re-edit it. I don't know. But sure, yeah. I'll link to that. It could be your... What's that Walt Whitman thing? Where... Leaves of grass or something like that. Sure. I am not a poet. But he kept re-editing it for 20 years. Okay. So, that could be yours. Okay, no. But I'll link to it. So... Yeah. Mission Impossible 1 through 5. Right. Let's do this. So, wait. Let's just say that we were very excited for this movie to come out because... Ghost Protocol, a couple years ago, we were so in love with. Yeah. Just in general. And as a franchise, this one... I mean, obviously, it does well. And it keeps getting more of them. And people like them. But I feel like they should be more famous and beloved as movies. It's true. Than they are because they are so good. And so, the fourth one... I mean, they're... Okay. How should we start? Well, let me start by saying... Mission Impossible, it seems to me, was America's reaction to James Bond. Right? Sure. Because it's a TV series from the oldie times. And even now, you have a movie series that's ongoing as well as the James Bond series. And especially because we got a Skyfall trailer right before Mission Impossible. You mean Spectre. Oh, sorry. Spectre. Yeah. Apologies to all the Bondies out there. And it was just very interesting to see kind of... I like how that trailer hits all the points of a James Bond movie. Yeah. Which is like, there's James Bond. There's the two ladies that are in the movie. Yeah. He kisses one of them. Sure. Tries to save the other one. Sure. And then there's a baddie. And then he's all like... James Bond. Yeah. And it's interesting because sort of going down the list and thinking about the five Mission Impossible movies, there sort of is the same formula but not quite. Well... Oh, you mean in terms of the ladies? We have Tom Cruise. Yeah. And then, of course, you have ladies who are in it. I mean, we can discuss further how the progression has been, which I think is really interesting. I do think it is really interesting. I don't know if you want to just start with that or not. Because if we did, I don't really... My problem is I don't really remember... Mission Impossible 1, directed by Brian De Palma. Yeah. And it's very... Yeah. And it's De Palma-y. So... And good. That one's good. Did he kiss anybody? Yeah. Who? Kristen Scott Thomas? Probably everyone. I haven't watched this one in full in a little bit, but he... There was the... What is her name? The other one. Not Kristen Scott Thomas. The one who is like John Voight's... Lady friend? Lady friend. Yeah. And she's like the main one in the movie. Wow. I don't remember her at all. Yeah. All right. Let's see. Her name is... Emmanuelle Baird? Sure. That girl. Yeah. So she's like the main one in the first movie. Wow. Okay. But that's the whole thing where like... It's very... Like, Bond-y with like the whole twist at the end where you like find out that his boss and her, like they're like the baddies the whole time. That's that one. And that one has like the most... Face masks? Face mask? Or no? Like really... Well, it was the first time you saw the face mask. The first one or the second one. Yeah. I mean, they definitely use them. Yeah. Those go away, which is really fun. And his biggest stunt was falling... Going down like a spider into the shaft. Yeah. So like... That's my favorite thing about Mission Impossible is like... We can get back to talking about like all the ladies, but like my favorite thing is like the progression of like the stunt work in these movies are sort of following like Tom Cruise's like descent into total stunts. Like the stunt person madness. Like... So the crazy thing in the first movie is Ethan breaking into the CIA and he like goes down that like the ceiling on the harness into the like laser thing. Yeah. Or whatever. And he can't drop any sweat or anything on the ground. And then that's it. Like the end. Yeah. That's the big thing. I think he falls out a window that explodes with water. Oh, yeah. That's... It was like an aquarium. Like an aquarium. Yeah, yeah. Because they shoot it and that's why it explodes. And then... Well, there's also like the train stuff at the end too, but it's not like he's doing it at that... You know what I mean? At that point, he's not. At this point in time, like Tom Cruise would like strap himself to the train since he did it to an airplane or whatever.

I'm your host, Avira, aka Caps Lock, and Cray's is Katie. Hi. And today we're going to talk about some just general news that's going on in the TV and film world. And then we're going to discuss the Mission Impossible series. Hell yeah. And particularly Rogue Nation, which was amazing. Amazing. So let's kick it off with some news. And what do you got for us today? All right. Well, all of my news is Star Wars based, so I hope you don't mind. I don't. This is where I get all my news about Star Wars is from you. So I just found out that the director of Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow, if that's how you pronounce it. Yeah. He's the director of Tomorrow. That's how you can remember his name. No. Is directing episode nine. Yes. That is the last one. Seven, eight, nine. Yes. Okay. And that makes me unhappy. As if you ever remembered the episode where we talked about Jurassic World, you'll know that I'm not a very big fan of him. And that movie had no flair whatsoever. Well, that really is a bummer. You know, the director of... So JJ's doing the next one, obviously. The first one. Yeah. The big one. Yeah. And then Rian Johnson, who directed Looper and Brick, is the next one after that. And then... That's a smart... You know, that's a good choice. Yeah. I'm fine with that. That's fine. It's an interesting choice. Now, I never saw Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not... What's it called? Safety Not Guaranteed, which, I mean, it does have time travel. So I should see it. But... That's not why he got the job. It's got Lindy Cred. Yes. No. Why he got the job is because he's directed one of the most box office success-y movies of our times, even though it's crap. I think his directing style is... Not a style. Safety Guaranteed. Oh. Get it? Yes. Because he makes standard movie that makes... A trillion million dollars. So that's not fun. And that's why they chose him, I think. Yeah. So that's part of my news. The other part is... Well, I guess it's the three-part Star Wars news. The second part being... I read an article from, like, a week or two ago that said that in Rogue One, Felicity Jones is rumored to be Boba Fett's daughter. Like, first she was, like, actually Leia. Aww. She's Boba Fett's daughter. I don't know what is going on there, and it's driving me crazy. But I read that, and I don't know if it's true. Or she is a bounty hunter, or the movie's about bounty hunters. I don't know. But if she is... Like, if this is all an attempt to just try to keep secret that she's Leia, is it... I don't think... She's no longer for sure she's not Leia. I don't... I don't think so. I mean, you saw a picture of her, right? Yeah. There's a photo release. Yeah, there was a photo release from it, like, a week or two ago that... Yeah. And she looks cool. And this is a prequel to actual Star Wars. Yes. So, yeah. And her hair looked real modern, not like... Not fun. Before 70s hair that they had. Yeah. No. But, yeah. So, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's going on there. And then, my third Star Wars news. This is just for me only. VR doesn't care about this whatsoever. But they also just announced at D23 that both Disneyland and... Hollywood Studios in Florida are getting a 14-acre Star Wars land expansion to the parks. So, like, an actual huge Star Wars land. And I am very excited. It's coming to Disney... Because we're all going to be able to go to the Mos Eisley Cantina Bar and drink. And it's going to be great. Wait, Disney World and Disneyland? Yeah, both. Both. Wow. And how long is that going to take? Forever. I saw a great tweet of this girl that I follow who was just like, I hope that they finish it before Florida is underwater. Oh, no. But, yeah. It's going to take forever, sure. Yeah. But that's exciting. Yeah. Once it's actually done. Like, I've always wanted, like, to go to the cantina. So, like, they could just do that first. And then I will be happy. I don't even need the rest of it. They could just have built the bar and I would be fine. I bet they're going to do it, like, in, you know, like, a little bit each. And then release. Yeah. Like, open that up. Yeah. And then just keep working on it some more. Yeah. Because they can't just, like, have a construction site for, like... A hundred years. Yeah. Yeah. Like... No, I know. Ten, twelve years or whatever. They did also just open a bar, the Indiana Jones Bar. So... And where? The Disney Springs, formerly Downtown Disney. Oh. So it's just, like, if you just go there, there's just that. Yeah. Well, no. There's lots of stuff there. But it's, like, part of, like, the new stuff. But that's open to, like... It's an empty space. You're going through all the big Harrison Ford movies. Bars are being built. Okay. Will you? What's your news? What you got? Well, my first news is from a little bit ago, which was the announcement that Annabeth Gish is going to be in the X-Files revival. And that is... Yeah. It deserves all the applause because I love her. And, you know, it's... It kind of bridges the whole world of the X-Files perfectly. I'm sure they'll get Robert Patrick as well because... Because out of the two, you would think, first, they would just get Robert Patrick. What if he's busy? I don't think he's busy. What is he doing? He's busy. Yeah, but he can't find, like, a little bit of time to just show up for a second. I don't know. I think he can. Okay. But maybe not. Who knows? Aren't they, like, done filming? So maybe not. Oh. Are they done? I thought it was from June to, like... No, I think we would have known if we ran... I thought it was, like, to the end of August. It's, like, right after their birthdays. Oh. I thought. I don't know if they were done. Why weren't they, like... Yeah. I don't think they're done yet. Well, maybe there's September. I'm not sure, but... You know what? If he's not in it, I don't care because she is. So there. I liked her more anyway. I liked Reyes. And I liked Doggett and Reyes. And... Yeah. It wasn't their... You know, I mean, the show at that point had been on for forever, and this is a bigger conversation. Every time... I feel like every time we bring up the X-Files, we're like, ooh, this is the thing for later. So we're going to have to do some kind of X-Files extravaganza. Okay, fine. But, yeah. I... Bottom line is we like them both a lot. Bottom line is if you like the X-Files, you like the, you know, the whole thing, and don't be a dick, and be like, well, if David Duchovny left, I'm not interested. Because guess what? Gillian Anderson was stuck there the whole time. So that means you favor him over her, and I hate you. Yeah. And you're wrong, and please get a new opinion. So... And because she was there, they did a great thing about introducing these two new people. Yeah. The integration of Doggett was incredible. Yeah, I liked it. And Reyes is just super fun. So great. And... I can't believe she tweeted about Whale Song. She did? Did you not see it? No. Okay, well, I'll show you later. Oh, my God. I'm speechless. I think there was a whale emoji. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. See, this is why she has to be in there. She's amazing. And so that was really exciting. And the second news was that because NBC had their TCAs, like, a couple days ago, they announced that the Xena reboot was actually a thing that was happening. So first, there was a... There was maybe a month ago, or a few weeks ago, some news being, like, a little burst of news about this being percolating and spreading around. And Lucy Lawless tweeted and said, guys, this is not happening. I would know. And then she tweeted that her husband yelled at her and said that she shouldn't say that. And then this was announced. So... Because her husband and Sam Raimi are involved. And... And... Yeah, that's exciting. That's really... I mean, I hope that Xena... Well, Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor... Xena and Gabrielle are involved with it. Yeah, that'd be good. I would hope. So, a plus to that. That makes me happy. Although, I don't know. NBC, I don't know about that. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, any... You don't have anything else? No. All my news is about Star Wars. Star Wars. Okay. All right. Let's just... Let's just talk about the Mission Impossible movies. Okay. You're kind of a little expert on them. You have made a vid. I have. Would you like to link to your vid? I will. Yeah. I made four Fester vids two years ago. Two years ago? Would you like to explain what Fester vids is? Oh, so... Sure. Okay. Fester vids in the vidding community is basically a holiday, a gift exchange where you sign up for a particular amount of fandoms that you are able to vid. And then you also write in, like... You offer a bunch of fandoms that you want. So, you then get matched up with someone who, like, you'll then make, like, a vid for. Yeah, they request... Based on what you request. Yeah, exactly. I'm only not finding the right words. Yeah, a request. Offers and requests. Yes. The correct words. So, yeah. So, a couple years ago, I had offered to do a Mission Impossible series, and that's what I got matched with, and so I made that. And at the time, it was the... The fourth? All four. Yeah. Yeah. Not this one, obviously. It just came out. And I think you should re-edit the thing or make a new one. No, I'll just make a new one. With all of it. Yeah. I don't know. I would like to just have her included. Once it's done, it's done. I don't want to re-edit it. I don't know. But sure, yeah. I'll link to that. It could be your... What's that Walt Whitman thing? Where... Leaves of grass or something like that. Sure. I am not a poet. But he kept re-editing it for 20 years. Okay. So, that could be yours. Okay, no. But I'll link to it. So... Yeah. Mission Impossible 1 through 5. Right. Let's do this. So, wait. Let's just say that we were very excited for this movie to come out because... Ghost Protocol, a couple years ago, we were so in love with. Yeah. Just in general. And as a franchise, this one... I mean, obviously, it does well. And it keeps getting more of them. And people like them. But I feel like they should be more famous and beloved as movies. It's true. Than they are because they are so good. And so, the fourth one... I mean, they're... Okay. How should we start? Well, let me start by saying... Mission Impossible, it seems to me, was America's reaction to James Bond. Right? Sure. Because it's a TV series from the oldie times. And even now, you have a movie series that's ongoing as well as the James Bond series. And especially because we got a Skyfall trailer right before Mission Impossible. You mean Spectre. Oh, sorry. Spectre. Yeah. Apologies to all the Bondies out there. And it was just very interesting to see kind of... I like how that trailer hits all the points of a James Bond movie. Yeah. Which is like, there's James Bond. There's the two ladies that are in the movie. Yeah. He kisses one of them. Sure. Tries to save the other one. Sure. And then there's a baddie. And then he's all like... James Bond. Yeah. And it's interesting because sort of going down the list and thinking about the five Mission Impossible movies, there sort of is the same formula but not quite. Well... Oh, you mean in terms of the ladies? We have Tom Cruise. Yeah. And then, of course, you have ladies who are in it. I mean, we can discuss further how the progression has been, which I think is really interesting. I do think it is really interesting. I don't know if you want to just start with that or not. Because if we did, I don't really... My problem is I don't really remember... Mission Impossible 1, directed by Brian De Palma. Yeah. And it's very... Yeah. And it's De Palma-y. So... And good. That one's good. Did he kiss anybody? Yeah. Who? Kristen Scott Thomas? Probably everyone. I haven't watched this one in full in a little bit, but he... There was the... What is her name? The other one. Not Kristen Scott Thomas. The one who is like John Voight's... Lady friend? Lady friend. Yeah. And she's like the main one in the movie. Wow. I don't remember her at all. Yeah. All right. Let's see. Her name is... Emmanuelle Baird? Sure. That girl. Yeah. So she's like the main one in the first movie. Wow. Okay. But that's the whole thing where like... It's very... Like, Bond-y with like the whole twist at the end where you like find out that his boss and her, like they're like the baddies the whole time. That's that one. And that one has like the most... Face masks? Face mask? Or no? Like really... Well, it was the first time you saw the face mask. The first one or the second one. Yeah. I mean, they definitely use them. Yeah. Those go away, which is really fun. And his biggest stunt was falling... Going down like a spider into the shaft. Yeah. So like... That's my favorite thing about Mission Impossible is like... We can get back to talking about like all the ladies, but like my favorite thing is like the progression of like the stunt work in these movies are sort of following like Tom Cruise's like descent into total stunts. Like the stunt person madness. Like... So the crazy thing in the first movie is Ethan breaking into the CIA and he like goes down that like the ceiling on the harness into the like laser thing. Yeah. Or whatever. And he can't drop any sweat or anything on the ground. And then that's it. Like the end. Yeah. That's the big thing. I think he falls out a window that explodes with water. Oh, yeah. That's... It was like an aquarium. Like an aquarium. Yeah, yeah. Because they shoot it and that's why it explodes. And then... Well, there's also like the train stuff at the end too, but it's not like he's doing it at that... You know what I mean? At that point, he's not. At this point in time, like Tom Cruise would like strap himself to the train since he did it to an airplane or whatever.
