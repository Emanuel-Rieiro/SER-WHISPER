{"text": " I once got bitten by mosquitoes so many times when I was a kid when I lived in Singapore. I actually got the blood infected in my leg once, and I couldn't walk. So for a couple of days anyway. I've got a real thing. I don't like them at all. Although, of course, in Japan, they're pretty unavoidable. But geez, it was like it's an overnight low of like two degrees or three degrees. It's not zero. I'm impressed that thing could live. But well, it didn't now. One for the good guys. It was a bit mean, wasn't it? I'm sorry, but I just don't like mosquitoes. Marzi 9862009. Now I'm seeing the action replay of me squashing it. Sorry about that. But no, mosquitoes. And I'm good with bugs. I always leave spiders. Okay, I'm cool with the mosquitoes, but I'm cool with insects in general. But mosquitoes, I just don't. I don't like them. So John McRoberts, great to see you. It's good to see everyone speaking up as well. So by the way, with the titles, I think that's what I was saying before the titles. If you've got title suggestions, it's great that you put them in the comments, except that the comments get deleted by Google at the end of the live video, which drives me nuts. So if you tweet it to me anonymously, or use your name, whatever, just create a Twitter account and tweet it with the hashtag TokyoTonight without a space, and I'll see it. And it'll go into the whole thing to get the T-shirt, and you get to title the show. So yeah, the one that I saw before I thought was kind of cool. So go and make sure you put it on Twitter. Marzi 9862009. England. That's cool. My sister's in England. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming, Marzi. Me. So I don't know why you're crying. Maybe it's because I stood up and showed I'm in my pajamas or something like that, or maybe it was a mosquito. But no, that had to be done. Nicholas Hoffman. Oh, no. So I guess I showed people a little bit more than they wanted to see, but there was no choice. That was an important situation. Red Rins, great to see you. That's right. This is live, and that's why you just got to see that. Nomberi Hito, great to see you. Man wins against small defenseless insect. Keta. Living in Osaka. I'm glad that you enjoyed it. It was self-defense. It was self-defense, man. Call it grand jury. I think I've got a good chance. They were resisting. That's not in good taste, is it? No. I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry. It was you or me. But anyway, who else we got? Knights Work Japan. It's good to see some new names here. Barringer, great to see. James O'Hara, good to see you. Emily Louise Maitland, always good to see you. So we've got a real great crowd, and with that, I'm going to get into the news topics. But again, great to see you guys, and I'm sorry that the audio version is going to have all this kind of bumping and chaos of me wrestling with what I will say now for the record was a grizzly bear that I defeated while recording the live show. So all that said, let us get into the video topics because there are a few tonight. There's a lot to talk about. I actually, oh, I ran into Abe today. I was like going to Nakano Station, and I saw Abe. It was like awesome. I think it's still a bit too soon for Ebola jokes, and trust me, I know because I've tried them. Okay, let's go into news topics and stories. So what do we got tonight? I need to remember myself. We're going to go through. There's going to be, we're talking about and also one thing I've noticed when I make this really small, it doesn't always capture all of the topics. So I just kind of want to make sure I get them all. So I am going to put a second window open here. It seems to sometimes skip through like the way that it automatically arranges them. But in terms of the topics that I've got that I want to talk about, well, maybe so, okay. There's a thing talking about which Jason, my agonist, asked for. I'm going to talk about the big debate about whether Japan should be aiming to revive or go through, they call it actually a painful revival or comfortable decline. And there's always been this thing, you know, why not just go into a comfortable decline? The butter shortage is driving me crazy. I'm going to update you guys on the big Japan butter shortage that's happening at the moment. Apparently, a story came up that Japan's country brand is number one of all country brands. I'm going to talk a bit about the Sony hack, which of course was kind of crazy. I'm not clear what triggered that or what's going on with that, but the Sony pictures hacking thing, it looks like it might be one of the biggest hacks in history. Also, a couple of examples from a Japanese article, a survey was done of managers of bad manners by their subordinates that they hate. So it's kind of a good thing on culture lessons or whatever that I'm going to talk about you guys as points that they said things like putting a, when you eat a meishi, putting it in your pocket right away. It's kind of a good thing. Bad form. It's kind of a, you can look at it. It's for Japanese people, the article, but it's a good cultural tip kind of a thing. Oh yeah, there was an interview with The Economist actually interviewed Shinzo Abe. So again, on the politics stuff, it was really interesting. It was good to see that they got a real detailed article and they published the full thing. So that was pretty awesome. I've got a link to that. I'm going to talk about that. And that is, I think it, the other topics I've got there from last week. Let me just make sure. Oh no, no, there's some more. I don't know. Again, it kind of randomly arranges these. That's why I want to go through the topics first to make sure I capture them. And you can tell me if I've missed one that you guys want to hear about. But in terms of other topics that I've got here, we've got, you know what I've just realized. Okay. I'm kind of reading off the screen the other way at the moment. Let me bring that over here. Oh, except that reformats it. So there was, ah, today is Pearl Harbor Day. I had no idea. And that's part of what, there's an article here talking about the perception that, you know, Pearl Harbor is widely kind of, it's not actually very widely felt or known or talked about in Japan, which I guess is kind of, it was kind of interesting to me perhaps what I first got here. But there's that. And wait a minute. This thing is just not being cooperative. With changing pages. So I might just leave it there. There was something else though. There was something else I really wanted to share. And, oh yeah. So the yen might be going to 130 yen to the dollar. It certainly is collapsing. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe the final one that I've got. So in Japan, Pearl Harbor is seen as just another battle. So if I get time, I'll talk about that. The other thing, apparently Casio, this is another Japanese story. Casio's top selling watch in the world isn't sold in Japan. And it's interesting what it is. It's a watch with a built-in kind of digital compass, or it's got even an analog compass, but it points to Mecca. And it only sells, obviously, in majority, well, I don't know if it sells in America or countries like that, but it sells mainly in majority Muslim countries. And you can see how that'd be kind of helpful if you want to, you know, bow to Mecca however many times a day, especially if there's not a prayer space available. And it's kind of cool that Casio does this. And this is like their best selling product. I've never heard of it before. That was kind of cool. Enough to talk about, but let's go through the topics that show up on this. And I'm going to go through them one by one now. I'm just looking at the comments as well. And I'm seeing some people, Benjamin Harris saying that it's going to be 200 yen to one pound soon. Oh, of course, pound. All right. Yeah. I can't do pound conversion. I thought, but you're saying dollars and we're exaggerating. But anyway, let's get into it. Boom. I took some Instagrams. Ah, so the one on the, that you can see on the left there, that's actually, I've caught, I ran into Abishinto. I was going to go and buy, looking for dinosaur Christmas presents. And I saw the LDP party campaigning. And I thought, well, sorry, son, I know this isn't what you're expecting, but no, no, the different type of dinosaur. But I actually caught him in the bit, which he was talking about on the news. When he was talking about how wonderful it's been under Abenomics and how there's no more people waiting for childcare. You know, of course we're using very convenient numbers, but I actually stood there and I heard that. And I noticed that all the people holding phones in the photographs I took that included the crowd were all holding the old fashioned flip phones. So we're not, I couldn't see smartphones. I don't know if that says something about the supporters, but in any case, yeah, Mr. Prime Minister, I guess I live in Tokyo. So of course the Prime Minister walks around and all that sort of stuff, but it was kind of funny to run into that. So also took a very nice photo of West Shinjuku today. Bit of HDR, a bit of, a bit of filming around with the filters, but I got some photos I quite like. So let's check out the most popular names. In Japan. And there are trends that happen with names. I mean, of course with English and as with Japanese. Baby, a photo of baby crying sumo. But the main takeaway from that is that of the, of the 300, 3,481 boys that were surveyed, there were 86 called Haruto. These things are generally influenced by, for example, people like popular talents, people who are in the media, stuff like that. That, that often lead to that. And it's kind of funny because of course these things do change in about, you know, they go in three or four year kind of fashion cycles, which means that the names of kids today are not like the names of adults that I know. For example, I don't know anyone called Haruto, but it's one of the most popular names right now. And I don't know how it got to be that, but look at that top of the ranking for the last, for the sixth straight year. So it's doing very well. Yuto came second with 60 and Sota came third with 57. Something I can imagine. Names are in and tough for guys. Of course, one thing as well with guys that's challenging, if you, if you're like me and looking for an international name, is that the, the generally speaking boys names are not very compatible with international, with English country, English speaking names. Girls names are very compatible, but, but guys aren't. So that's interesting. Haruto, Yuto and Sota. That's kind of cool. Those are the, the top three have been unchanged since 2012. I had no idea. So last three years, those are the solid top three. So yeah, I guess you're going to see a lot of kids come through that in a few years. With girls, the number one name was Mei. That's interesting. It sounds kind of Chinese to me, but they're all very short, aren't they? Actually, they're very Chinese sounding, all three. Followed by Yu. And last name's most popular name, Ning. Last year, Yu was the most popular and Ning was the number three. So apparently Ning was the most popular kanji character. They don't show it here, but I see it's a two character. For girls, there was a Hina, Hinata, Hana, Haruna were names that were popular for girls. Okay. So it goes into the types of kanji characters which are there. So that's kind of cool. I mean, you know, I had no idea what, what popular names are. I actually made a wee bit of a thing. When I was naming my son, I checked. It was, it was a name which works in both languages. I'm not going to give it away necessarily here. But I thought, and I checked, it's used mainly for boys in Japan. I just did a name search. I did a few photos just to check that these were, these were boys. I checked the Kung that they were using, Kun. And yeah, a lot of boys were using it. So I thought it was all good. Works in both languages. Excellent. So I named it. But it turned out that just from that year, there was like a popular female talent and the name can work in both genders. Although it was more common in boys up to that year. But all of a sudden that year, there was like a female broadcaster who was very popular, who had that first name, first name. So when I announced what the name of my son was, everyone came back to me. They said, is that a boy or a girl? Which I hope doesn't cause problems for him later because it suddenly became very popular as a girl's name. But you do get a lot of names like that actually in Japanese that work with both as well. That's interesting. Okay. So those are names. Anyway, one day Hika will make the list, says Don Bihito. We'll see. Landing Wombat. Sorry you got to take off, but see you later. So Kamiya, what's the next story that we've got? We got, boom. Pictures hack was worse than everyone thought. Well, this just keeps coming out. Of course, they're implying. So the things that I've been reading about this in terms of the information that I've heard, I guess everybody's up to speed on this. But for those who don't know, it turns out that Sony Pictures was very, very, very thoroughly hacked a few days ago to the point that pretty much all the salary information, a lot of social security numbers, salary, all that kind of stuff of all the employees of Sony Pictures was found and released online. A lot of very sensitive personal information, as well as the entire digital database of Sony Pictures. They released apparently, what's the name of the Brad Pitt movie again? There's a Brad Pitt war movie. I can't remember the name of it, but there's that and there's Annie and there's a couple of movies that haven't been released yet that have now been released online that were hacked. And the group that was doing it, I think they're called GOP or something, not GOP, that's the Republicans, but something like that anyway. And they kind of come off the messages that they've been sending and the threatening emails that they've been sending to employees, telling them that this isn't over. This is just the start. And they're going to, you know, it looks like it was from a failed extortion or maybe not a failed, it was from an extortion attempt to get Sony. And they were showing that they could make good on what they're doing. The emails, which are in terrible, terrible English and grammar claim, that they have insiders helping them do it. They also claim that they've gotten, they've obtained, they've hacked more than 100 terabytes of data. They've only released, well, they've released like however much so far, but it's only like 1% of what they have. But what they've released includes the fact that, of course, Sony, as everyone now knows, apparently kept, some IT person kept a list of everyone's individual passwords in a folder on their system, unprotected, called passwords. So through that, obviously a lot of information was gathered, so it must have been done over a very long time. The people say that they're getting back at Sony Pictures for something. It's not clear what. There was some speculation it might be North Korea, using either North Korean and or Chinese hackers, because they were very, North Korea has been very, very unhappy with a movie by Seth, I think it was Seth Rogen, on the theme of assassinating the North Korean president that was coming out. Although apparently today North Korea has denied it, but well, maybe they did, maybe they couldn't. It's kind of interesting to think that a country basically without internet could have hackers, but of course North Korea can. So that was one thing, and they kind of denied it and didn't deny it.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.88, "text": " I once got bitten by mosquitoes so many times when I was a kid when I lived

I actually got the blood infected in my leg once, and I couldn't walk. So for a couple of days anyway. I've got a real thing. I don't like them at all. Although, of course, in Japan, they're pretty unavoidable. But geez, it was like it's an overnight low of like two degrees or three degrees. It's not zero. I'm impressed that thing could live. But well, it didn't now. One for the good guys. It was a bit mean, wasn't it? I'm sorry, but I just don't like mosquitoes. Marzi 9862009. Now I'm seeing the action replay of me squashing it. Sorry about that. But no, mosquitoes. And I'm good with bugs. I always leave spiders. Okay, I'm cool with the mosquitoes, but I'm cool with insects in general. But mosquitoes, I just don't. I don't like them. So John McRoberts, great to see you. It's good to see everyone speaking up as well. So by the way, with the titles, I think that's what I was saying before the titles. If you've got title suggestions, it's great that you put them in the comments, except that the comments get deleted by Google at the end of the live video, which drives me nuts. So if you tweet it to me anonymously, or use your name, whatever, just create a Twitter account and tweet it with the hashtag TokyoTonight without a space, and I'll see it. And it'll go into the whole thing to get the T-shirt, and you get to title the show. So yeah, the one that I saw before I thought was kind of cool. So go and make sure you put it on Twitter. Marzi 9862009. England. That's cool. My sister's in England. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming, Marzi. Me. So I don't know why you're crying. Maybe it's because I stood up and showed I'm in my pajamas or something like that, or maybe it was a mosquito. But no, that had to be done. Nicholas Hoffman. Oh, no. So I guess I showed people a little bit more than they wanted to see, but there was no choice. That was an important situation. Red Rins, great to see you. That's right. This is live, and that's why you just got to see that. Nomberi Hito, great to see you. Man wins against small defenseless insect. Keta. Living in Osaka. I'm glad that you enjoyed it. It was self-defense. It was self-defense, man. Call it grand jury. I think I've got a good chance. They were resisting. That's not in good taste, is it? No. I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry. It was you or me. But anyway, who else we got? Knights Work Japan. It's good to see some new names here. Barringer, great to see. James O'Hara, good to see you. Emily Louise Maitland, always good to see you. So we've got a real great crowd, and with that, I'm going to get into the news topics. But again, great to see you guys, and I'm sorry that the audio version is going to have all this kind of bumping and chaos of me wrestling with what I will say now for the record was a grizzly bear that I defeated while recording the live show. So all that said, let us get into the video topics because there are a few tonight. There's a lot to talk about. I actually, oh, I ran into Abe today. I was like going to Nakano Station, and I saw Abe. It was like awesome. I think it's still a bit too soon for Ebola jokes, and trust me, I know because I've tried them. Okay, let's go into news topics and stories. So what do we got tonight? I need to remember myself. We're going to go through. There's going to be, we're talking about and also one thing I've noticed when I make this really small, it doesn't always capture all of the topics. So I just kind of want to make sure I get them all. So I am going to put a second window open here. It seems to sometimes skip through like the way that it automatically arranges them. But in terms of the topics that I've got that I want to talk about, well, maybe so, okay. There's a thing talking about which Jason, my agonist, asked for. I'm going to talk about the big debate about whether Japan should be aiming to revive or go through, they call it actually a painful revival or comfortable decline. And there's always been this thing, you know, why not just go into a comfortable decline? The butter shortage is driving me crazy. I'm going to update you guys on the big Japan butter shortage that's happening at the moment. Apparently, a story came up that Japan's country brand is number one of all country brands. I'm going to talk a bit about the Sony hack, which of course was kind of crazy. I'm not clear what triggered that or what's going on with that, but the Sony pictures hacking thing, it looks like it might be one of the biggest hacks in history. Also, a couple of examples from a Japanese article, a survey was done of managers of bad manners by their subordinates that they hate. So it's kind of a good thing on culture lessons or whatever that I'm going to talk about you guys as points that they said things like putting a, when you eat a meishi, putting it in your pocket right away. It's kind of a good thing. Bad form. It's kind of a, you can look at it. It's for Japanese people, the article, but it's a good cultural tip kind of a thing. Oh yeah, there was an interview with The Economist actually interviewed Shinzo Abe. So again, on the politics stuff, it was really interesting. It was good to see that they got a real detailed article and they published the full thing. So that was pretty awesome. I've got a link to that. I'm going to talk about that. And that is, I think it, the other topics I've got there from last week. Let me just make sure. Oh no, no, there's some more. I don't know. Again, it kind of randomly arranges these. That's why I want to go through the topics first to make sure I capture them. And you can tell me if I've missed one that you guys want to hear about. But in terms of other topics that I've got here, we've got, you know what I've just realized. Okay. I'm kind of reading off the screen the other way at the moment. Let me bring that over here. Oh, except that reformats it. So there was, ah, today is Pearl Harbor Day. I had no idea. And that's part of what, there's an article here talking about the perception that, you know, Pearl Harbor is widely kind of, it's not actually very widely felt or known or talked about in Japan, which I guess is kind of, it was kind of interesting to me perhaps what I first got here. But there's that. And wait a minute. This thing is just not being cooperative. With changing pages. So I might just leave it there. There was something else though. There was something else I really wanted to share. And, oh yeah. So the yen might be going to 130 yen to the dollar. It certainly is collapsing. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe the final one that I've got. So in Japan, Pearl Harbor is seen as just another battle. So if I get time, I'll talk about that. The other thing, apparently Casio, this is another Japanese story. Casio's top selling watch in the world isn't sold in Japan. And it's interesting what it is. It's a watch with a built-in kind of digital compass, or it's got even an analog compass, but it points to Mecca. And it only sells, obviously, in majority, well, I don't know if it sells in America or countries like that, but it sells mainly in majority Muslim countries. And you can see how that'd be kind of helpful if you want to, you know, bow to Mecca however many times a day, especially if there's not a prayer space available. And it's kind of cool that Casio does this. And this is like their best selling product. I've never heard of it before. That was kind of cool. Enough to talk about, but let's go through the topics that show up on this. And I'm going to go through them one by one now. I'm just looking at the comments as well. And I'm seeing some people, Benjamin Harris saying that it's going to be 200 yen to one pound soon. Oh, of course, pound. All right. Yeah. I can't do pound conversion. I thought, but you're saying dollars and we're exaggerating. But anyway, let's get into it. Boom. I took some Instagrams. Ah, so the one on the, that you can see on the left there, that's actually, I've caught, I ran into Abishinto. I was going to go and buy, looking for dinosaur Christmas presents. And I saw the LDP party campaigning. And I thought, well, sorry, son, I know this isn't what you're expecting, but no, no, the different type of dinosaur. But I actually caught him in the bit, which he was talking about on the news. When he was talking about how wonderful it's been under Abenomics and how there's no more people waiting for childcare. You know, of course we're using very convenient numbers, but I actually stood there and I heard that. And I noticed that all the people holding phones in the photographs I took that included the crowd were all holding the old fashioned flip phones. So we're not, I couldn't see smartphones. I don't know if that says something about the supporters, but in any case, yeah, Mr. Prime Minister, I guess I live in Tokyo. So of course the Prime Minister walks around and all that sort of stuff, but it was kind of funny to run into that. So also took a very nice photo of West Shinjuku today. Bit of HDR, a bit of, a bit of filming around with the filters, but I got some photos I quite like. So let's check out the most popular names. In Japan. And there are trends that happen with names. I mean, of course with English and as with Japanese. Baby, a photo of baby crying sumo. But the main takeaway from that is that of the, of the 300, 3,481 boys that were surveyed, there were 86 called Haruto. These things are generally influenced by, for example, people like popular talents, people who are in the media, stuff like that. That, that often lead to that. And it's kind of funny because of course these things do change in about, you know, they go in three or four year kind of fashion cycles, which means that the names of kids today are not like the names of adults that I know. For example, I don't know anyone called Haruto, but it's one of the most popular names right now. And I don't know how it got to be that, but look at that top of the ranking for the last, for the sixth straight year. So it's doing very well. Yuto came second with 60 and Sota came third with 57. Something I can imagine. Names are in and tough for guys. Of course, one thing as well with guys that's challenging, if you, if you're like me and looking for an international name, is that the, the generally speaking boys names are not very compatible with international, with English country, English speaking names. Girls names are very compatible, but, but guys aren't. So that's interesting. Haruto, Yuto and Sota. That's kind of cool. Those are the, the top three have been unchanged since 2012. I had no idea. So last three years, those are the solid top three. So yeah, I guess you're going to see a lot of kids come through that in a few years. With girls, the number one name was Mei. That's interesting. It sounds kind of Chinese to me, but they're all very short, aren't they? Actually, they're very Chinese sounding, all three. Followed by Yu. And last name's most popular name, Ning. Last year, Yu was the most popular and Ning was the number three. So apparently Ning was the most popular kanji character. They don't show it here, but I see it's a two character. For girls, there was a Hina, Hinata, Hana, Haruna were names that were popular for girls. Okay. So it goes into the types of kanji characters which are there. So that's kind of cool. I mean, you know, I had no idea what, what popular names are. I actually made a wee bit of a thing. When I was naming my son, I checked. It was, it was a name which works in both languages. I'm not going to give it away necessarily here. But I thought, and I checked, it's used mainly for boys in Japan. I just did a name search. I did a few photos just to check that these were, these were boys. I checked the Kung that they were using, Kun. And yeah, a lot of boys were using it. So I thought it was all good. Works in both languages. Excellent. So I named it. But it turned out that just from that year, there was like a popular female talent and the name can work in both genders. Although it was more common in boys up to that year. But all of a sudden that year, there was like a female broadcaster who was very popular, who had that first name, first name. So when I announced what the name of my son was, everyone came back to me. They said, is that a boy or a girl? Which I hope doesn't cause problems for him later because it suddenly became very popular as a girl's name. But you do get a lot of names like that actually in Japanese that work with both as well. That's interesting. Okay. So those are names. Anyway, one day Hika will make the list, says Don Bihito. We'll see. Landing Wombat. Sorry you got to take off, but see you later. So Kamiya, what's the next story that we've got? We got, boom. Pictures hack was worse than everyone thought. Well, this just keeps coming out. Of course, they're implying. So the things that I've been reading about this in terms of the information that I've heard, I guess everybody's up to speed on this. But for those who don't know, it turns out that Sony Pictures was very, very, very thoroughly hacked a few days ago to the point that pretty much all the salary information, a lot of social security numbers, salary, all that kind of stuff of all the employees of Sony Pictures was found and released online. A lot of very sensitive personal information, as well as the entire digital database of Sony Pictures. They released apparently, what's the name of the Brad Pitt movie again? There's a Brad Pitt war movie. I can't remember the name of it, but there's that and there's Annie and there's a couple of movies that haven't been released yet that have now been released online that were hacked. And the group that was doing it, I think they're called GOP or something, not GOP, that's the Republicans, but something like that anyway. And they kind of come off the messages that they've been sending and the threatening emails that they've been sending to employees, telling them that this isn't over. This is just the start. And they're going to, you know, it looks like it was from a failed extortion or maybe not a failed, it was from an extortion attempt to get Sony. And they were showing that they could make good on what they're doing. The emails, which are in terrible, terrible English and grammar claim, that they have insiders helping them do it. They also claim that they've gotten, they've obtained, they've hacked more than 100 terabytes of data. They've only released, well, they've released like however much so far, but it's only like 1% of what they have. But what they've released includes the fact that, of course, Sony, as everyone now knows, apparently kept, some IT person kept a list of everyone's individual passwords in a folder on their system, unprotected, called passwords. So through that, obviously a lot of information was gathered, so it must have been done over a very long time. The people say that they're getting back at Sony Pictures for something. It's not clear what. There was some speculation it might be North Korea, using either North Korean and or Chinese hackers, because they were very, North Korea has been very, very unhappy with a movie by Seth, I think it was Seth Rogen, on the theme of assassinating the North Korean president that was coming out. Although apparently today North Korea has denied it, but well, maybe they did, maybe they couldn't. It's kind of interesting to think that a country basically without internet could have hackers, but of course North Korea can. So that was one thing, and they kind of denied it and didn't deny it.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.88, "text": " I once got bitten by mosquitoes so many times when I was a kid when
