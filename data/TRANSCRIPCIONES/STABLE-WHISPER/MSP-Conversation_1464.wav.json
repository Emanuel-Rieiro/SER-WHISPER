{"text": " The first thing I want to talk about is, I don't know if any of you remember, about like maybe a few years ago there was this woman in Wood Green who was found dead in her flat after three years. No one had noticed she was dead or gone from their lives. So she was like a complete skeleton, like sat in front of some Christmas presents and they couldn't even identify how she died because she was just like dust and bone. And when I first read that article I thought like, oh she must have been like, you know, a junkie or had no family, no friends and all that stuff that you might assume. But actually like looking into it more, she had family, she had had friends over her life so far, she was like in her 30s. And she'd had boyfriends and jobs and was fairly like, you know, functional, whatever that means. And I was like, how does that even happen? It seemed that she was the kind of person who came and went from friendship groups and didn't really have strong opinions and wasn't, was kind of bland I guess. And I don't know if she was bland on purpose or not. But anyway, this is a poem about that lady, if I can find it. Are you guys okay? Do you need a hug? I do. Later on, come get me. Unless you're creepy. Okay, this is called Sayonara. So this is basically how to be like her. If you want no one to know that you've died, do this. Walk in crowds and tuck your elbows in. This is a rollercoaster life, they say. There should have been a height limit for safety's sake, only they didn't think of that until it was too late. So those of us who just aren't big enough, who don't fit snugly in the seats are bounced around and dangled screaming over laughing strangers. Somebody might even take a photograph. Somebody else might try to make you buy it. Whatever you do, remember to keep quiet when the others are debating psychological ideas or the climate. It's better to remain lukewarm. Be sure to turn up every day for work, but not arrive too early or stay late. Avoid letting the emails get on top of you, but never, ever have a good idea. If you insist on going to the doctor, it's best to ask for penicillin, especially if your GP has told you that it's just a cold. Fear growing old, but only mildly. If someone working at a till offers you stamps, decline. Unless you're at the post office when saying yes to stamps is fine. In supermarkets, buy a realistic mixture of fresh fruit and processed wheat-based junk. In meaningful relationships, remember anniversaries with chocolates and a card. If you're invited to a do involving fancy dress, think long and hard before agreeing to attend. If you must go, don't spend a fortune on the costume of a television villain from a cartoon of your youth, but don't homemake. Wear something obvious and uninspired and topical enough to be the thing that everybody else has thought of too. Smash mirrors. You will not be needing all that look. And looking at your eyes could otherwise entice a sort of hanging on. Let go and go without a peep. I promise you, it will be just as if you're lying in a dreamless sleep. No one will miss you, clear that's what you want. People will say that from what little they recall, the girl was nice. So I'm sort of nervous about this bit, because I usually do like very fluffy things, and anyone who's probably almost none of you, but anyone who knows my poetry stuff, I talk about boys a lot, and I sometimes talk about poo, and sometimes I talk about boys and poo in relation to each other. But I also have a lot of other poems I write that I tend not to crack out, because I don't like depressing people, I guess. But I write a lot of poems about one other subject that is not boys, because it's something I really give a shit about, which is the amount of children that are dying because they're being neglected or abused. And it's being noticed, but not acted upon. And then they go, oh shit, we kind of thought that might happen. And then they're already dead. And they're like, sorry, we failed you. We won't do it again. And then it happens like a week later. And I know it's a really grim topic. Being polite seems to be more important than potentially getting a kid out of a really bad situation. So like, if you hear through the wall, like really weird banging screaming, you're like, oh, I better not knock in, because how embarrassing if I'm wrong. Like, my neighbor might think I'm a bit of a dick. But like, if you're right, that's a massive deal. So like, who cares if your neighbor thinks you're a bit of a dick? You should probably knock in, you know? And over and over, this seems to happen. There was a baby called Perrin Barlow. He was nine months old, and he was killed by his parents. And, you know, a neighbor said after it was all over, oh, yeah, I did used to see him and his older siblings pressed against the window, pleading to be let out. And I just thought, okay, so why didn't you let them out or like smash the fucking window? So I, and I get that it's hard. And I get that there's loads of legislation and stuff as well. I don't even know how to say that word. Is it legislation or legislation? Thank you. Legislation. I don't know if you remember Anna Klimby. That was quite a big case as well. It was in the news a few years ago. But anyway, she was eight. Killed by her mother and her mother's boyfriend. And she, let me just remember how many, yeah, she, in the post-mortem, she had 128 marks on her body, like current wounds, 128. And she had been in hospital, but they had concluded that they must have been accidental, like 128. So sometimes people are telling, because that was a friend had actually brought her to the hospital. So that's cool. But then you get there and you're like, hey, social worker, woohoo. And a police officer, and they came and then they went, ah, she's probably all right. Cause it's only 128. So it must be just like lots of falling down. She must be really dizzy kid. So yeah, that also pisses me off. There was another kid called Blake Fowler. He was seven. He was killed. It was a head injury. They found, they found some like a substance that's only in ceilings in his hair because he'd obviously been like bounced off the ceiling. But he was actually very vocal compared to a lot of the children and was often just coming into school. And like telling his teachers everything. He wasn't very kind of frightened of what that might do. He just like talk about it all the time. But another thing he would do is like beat the shit out of everyone. He was like seven and like this hard little fucker. And he never understood. Apparently the teacher said that he didn't get why he shouldn't. Cause he would just say, but this is what my dad does, you know? So yeah. So I'm just going to read some poems that are kind of about this topic. Is that okay? Yeah. Is that okay? Okay. So this is called At Risk. Oh, one more thing. In Ireland, the first year of primary school, what do you call that here again? Reception. It's called junior infants. You just need to know that. Okay. At Risk. He was forever stuffing junior infants in the bottom of the can machine. Like as if their sweetness meant they should be stored amongst the cokes. They seldom cried. Partly out of shock. Partly out of glimpsing fizzy drinks they regularly lifted from the fridge in gym. And then they would put their limbs into the trolley only to be scolded at the checkouts. He liked how cleanly some would fit and often removed their Velcroed shoes, arranging them in natural looking footstep formations leading to the base of the machine. And once a child was neatly tucked away, he would go back to class and be a better pupil, sharing out the crayons and remembering to use the red for hearts and not for shading head wounds. That's that. So here's the thing, right? That's what I think about all that stuff. And I've always sort of ranted about the fact that people should do something if they know it's something. I've always ranted quite a lot. I had an incident where I had my opportunity to do what I, you know, practice what I preach. And I, well, this is called Nothing Happens. Nothing Happened in Poundland. I should have stopped her. But I was busy stocking up on Toblerones and cheap cod liver oil to grease my bones. In the queue, I gasped in shock, nearly at the top, delving as I froze amid the overcrowded shelving for the courage to shout stop. But then the cashier shouted next. And I fell out of and in line and also short. Short of your very basic need for some protection. For bigger hands to bat the jerking ones away. For sharper teeth to cut through hisses with firm justice. For softer words instilling credence that if you were brave enough to come with me and tell on mummy, everything would be okay. I made small steps and sought an ally in the cashier. That woman strangling her toddler. Do you see? But he didn't even shrug. And me, I walked away. So I guess I'm just saying, don't walk away. Even if I tell you not to. And then I did. And that's me. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so it's a strange experience for performers, I think, doing stand-up tragedy. Like, if you're a comedian and you decide to do something serious, then it's a strange experience to not have laughs. And if you're a spoken word performer, it's even weirder. I'm sure you guys feel a bit strange too. Like, it's strange to clap a really sad thing, even if you enjoyed it. So well done, audience, and well done, Amy, for getting through that together. This is a place where I want people to be able to talk about those things which we normally don't talk about. And so I'm really pleased that that's what you decided to do, even if it is weird to give you two thumbs up, particularly after the set. Like, now I know how weird those two thumbs were. I feel strange. But that's okay. It's okay to feel strange. Now, our next performer is, he's doing, right, so he's basically at the moment doing an amazing show that I've sort of seen in works in progress versions of it. It's called Good Grief. And he is crowdfunding it through Ideas Tap until March the 16th. So if you can fund, help fund his show about grief, really, I would urge you to do so. You can find out more about it at www. thegoodgriefproject.com and put your hands together for our final Tragedian of the Night, Jack Rook! Thank you very much. See, I didn't even tell Dave to do a plug. It's like on this morning when they're like, and you can check them out on here. I wish my name was No Signal because then it would make this lovely little sign here. I'm a hip-hop artist. My name's No Signal. Thanks very much for coming. My name's Jack Rook, and I'm about to tell you, Amy said, like, she likes to write about boys and poo. I like to write about being fat and my dead dad. Anybody got a dead dad? Give me a holler. Woo! Oh, yeah, dead parents, dead the lot. Brilliant. Well, not brilliant, but I suppose you've got to make the best out of a shitty situation, which is pretty much what my show Good Grief is. I'm going to read you some bits and bobs from it. I stupidly had a prop to bring you all, and then I left it on the rail replacement bus, which I'm going to invoice the overground for that, really. But, yeah, so I'm going to read some bits and bobs to you. Is anybody familiar with a poet called Holly McNeish? Yeah? Yeah, we've got a few, yeah. So, she did this night once called An Evening with Death, and it was through the eyes of poets and doctors, which was quite an interesting one. And on one side of the stage, she had a sign saying, Before I Die, I Want To. And on the other side of the stage, it said, Before I Die, I Need To. So I decided to write something in response to that, and imaginatively, I decided to call it Before I Die. Before I die, I want to eat bounty bars, just to be controversial. I want to star in my own less corny version of the Match.com commercial. I want to go at Sainsbury's self-checkout tills with a sledgehammer. I want to be a drag queen called Nigella Farage. And I want to see Nigel change his name to Raj. I want to have rough, filthy sex with you all. With you all, especially you. You. You. Lady on your phone. Oh, so... You can hit me up on BBM, Twitter, or maybe even give me a go on Tinder. I want to drink more, eat less. I want to see Katie Hopkins down the street, so I can sit as arrest her for hate crimes against fat people. I want less Claudia and more Tess. I want to hear that girl on the tube say that she doesn't mind if her boyfriend cries, because if his best mate died, he'd be worried, surely, if he didn't shed some tears. I want to go walk about the 270-square-mile Orindee Game Reserve in Namibia with Ray Mears. I want to find out that secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. I want to take a shit outside of American Apparel and wipe my arse on a copy of Vice magazine. I want to make Dad proud. I want to make Mum proud. I want to make Dave Pickering proud. I want to throw up outside proud in Camden, because everybody out in Camden after 10pm is a bit of an arsehole. I want to not speak so loud during at least one occasion where volume is typically frowned upon, i.e. assemblies, church services, or the STI clinic. I want to go to the Harvester salad bar and not feel compelled to hide all the good stuff at the bottom of the bowl, like the little bacon bits, the crispy onion. Has anybody gone to Harvester and done this? Because you just feel self-conscious, like, oh, I'm eating all the fatty foods at the salad bar again. I want the cast of TOWIE to stay in Marbs. I want to learn sign language. I want to learn sign language and communicate with people who have totally different stories to tell. I want to help my mum to find her confidence again. I want to help my mum come out of her shell. I want to go into All Saints with a pack of highlighters and colour in all their dull, monochrome, wanky clothes. I want to understand what the hell PPI even is. I want to see suicide not be the biggest killer of young men who are gay or have lost a parent or who feel that they are happiest when asleep, and I really want to be on the pink team of supermarket sweep. I want to see all those who use the compound words mega lulz or amazeballs hung up upside down by their balls and dragged via a rusty iron chain down a German motorway. I want to see Jeremy Clarkson hung upside down by his balls and dragged via a rusty iron chain down a German motorway. I want to hear my generation realise that the word frape is not okay. I want to hear my generation not describe things that are a bit lame with the word gay. I want to see us bridge the gap between young and old and I want to stop being hassled by cash for gold. I want to form a punk band. Called Fuck the Limelight with Michelle from Destiny's Child. And the one who got chucked out the XX. I want to hear a Flo Rida song that doesn't sell sex. I want Vogue to apologise for the fact that from 2003 to 2013 there was not one single solo cover featuring a black female model. I want to see my new neighbour come out and speak to me because I picked up her post. And this is actually true. Her name is Molly Coddle. I want to see Assata Shakur be acquitted so she can leave political refuge in Cuba, drink cocktails on Miami Beach and teach the truth. But I really want to avoid Magaluf. I want to experience proof of aliens like in the Spice World movie. Has anyone seen it? Where Meat Loaf drives the tour bus and drops the girls all off for a slash. And then I want to basically tell the Martians to tell Jerry not to quit next year. I want to meet Dad for a beer and a dream so I don't forget him. I want to get slim but never walk into a gym. I want to finish off life full to the brim. But before I die, I suppose I just need to be happy. Thank you. So the reason I stumbled on a word is because halfway through performing I realised that I've got a piece of chewing gum in my mouth. And then I thought, what would the performer etiquette be of spitting out chewing gum in front of 30 people in acne into my mouth and hoping nobody saw? And then I realised you'd all see. So I'm going to keep it in as a bit of a task to perform and have chewing gum in my mouth. Okay? So if you see it, then maybe shout a word like BINGO! And then I'll come over and give you 20 quid. So fuck off Amy McAllister. I'll give you 20 quid anyway. I'm sure I hear you that. I'm going to do a poem. I'm going to do one more poem. What would you guys like? Should we do something? Right, I'm going to lift. Let's be high energy, closing act. And let's go for something that I think Amy would like. This poem is called Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. I really want to spit out this chewing gum. Do you know what I'm going to do? Right. Everybody just hum. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Because it was really distracting and I would have just ended up spitting it out at this gentleman here. This poem is called Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. Mum, my mum wants us to pay for an over-expensive chat with some snooty twat from Hertfordshire Bereavement Services. Her name is Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. She's pale with a Lego haircut that defies all acknowledged laws of gravity. She smells like strep and deep heat. Feet like horse's hooves. She's outrageously posh. Walks in our house dressed in what looks like a pair of curtains and I'm certain that she's older than mine and mum's combined age. Our counselling session begins and ever so frail Gail starts to wriggle in our armchair. Every time I stare mum pinches my knee. We start talking and Gail comes out with the age-old cliche, tell me how does that make you feel? Me and mum sit opposite her on the sofa surrounded by a mountain of unwashed mugs, a stack of used scratch cards, an ashtray full of dog ends, a TV guide where I've drawn moustaches on Peggy Mitchell and a list of 26 people on the telly we'd like to punch because they're too smug.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.6, "text": " The first thing I want to talk about is,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens":

Green who was found dead in her flat after three years. No one had noticed she was dead or gone from their lives. So she was like a complete skeleton, like sat in front of some Christmas presents and they couldn't even identify how she died because she was just like dust and bone. And when I first read that article I thought like, oh she must have been like, you know, a junkie or had no family, no friends and all that stuff that you might assume. But actually like looking into it more, she had family, she had had friends over her life so far, she was like in her 30s. And she'd had boyfriends and jobs and was fairly like, you know, functional, whatever that means. And I was like, how does that even happen? It seemed that she was the kind of person who came and went from friendship groups and didn't really have strong opinions and wasn't, was kind of bland I guess. And I don't know if she was bland on purpose or not. But anyway, this is a poem about that lady, if I can find it. Are you guys okay? Do you need a hug? I do. Later on, come get me. Unless you're creepy. Okay, this is called Sayonara. So this is basically how to be like her. If you want no one to know that you've died, do this. Walk in crowds and tuck your elbows in. This is a rollercoaster life, they say. There should have been a height limit for safety's sake, only they didn't think of that until it was too late. So those of us who just aren't big enough, who don't fit snugly in the seats are bounced around and dangled screaming over laughing strangers. Somebody might even take a photograph. Somebody else might try to make you buy it. Whatever you do, remember to keep quiet when the others are debating psychological ideas or the climate. It's better to remain lukewarm. Be sure to turn up every day for work, but not arrive too early or stay late. Avoid letting the emails get on top of you, but never, ever have a good idea. If you insist on going to the doctor, it's best to ask for penicillin, especially if your GP has told you that it's just a cold. Fear growing old, but only mildly. If someone working at a till offers you stamps, decline. Unless you're at the post office when saying yes to stamps is fine. In supermarkets, buy a realistic mixture of fresh fruit and processed wheat-based junk. In meaningful relationships, remember anniversaries with chocolates and a card. If you're invited to a do involving fancy dress, think long and hard before agreeing to attend. If you must go, don't spend a fortune on the costume of a television villain from a cartoon of your youth, but don't homemake. Wear something obvious and uninspired and topical enough to be the thing that everybody else has thought of too. Smash mirrors. You will not be needing all that look. And looking at your eyes could otherwise entice a sort of hanging on. Let go and go without a peep. I promise you, it will be just as if you're lying in a dreamless sleep. No one will miss you, clear that's what you want. People will say that from what little they recall, the girl was nice. So I'm sort of nervous about this bit, because I usually do like very fluffy things, and anyone who's probably almost none of you, but anyone who knows my poetry stuff, I talk about boys a lot, and I sometimes talk about poo, and sometimes I talk about boys and poo in relation to each other. But I also have a lot of other poems I write that I tend not to crack out, because I don't like depressing people, I guess. But I write a lot of poems about one other subject that is not boys, because it's something I really give a shit about, which is the amount of children that are dying because they're being neglected or abused. And it's being noticed, but not acted upon. And then they go, oh shit, we kind of thought that might happen. And then they're already dead. And they're like, sorry, we failed you. We won't do it again. And then it happens like a week later. And I know it's a really grim topic. Being polite seems to be more important than potentially getting a kid out of a really bad situation. So like, if you hear through the wall, like really weird banging screaming, you're like, oh, I better not knock in, because how embarrassing if I'm wrong. Like, my neighbor might think I'm a bit of a dick. But like, if you're right, that's a massive deal. So like, who cares if your neighbor thinks you're a bit of a dick? You should probably knock in, you know? And over and over, this seems to happen. There was a baby called Perrin Barlow. He was nine months old, and he was killed by his parents. And, you know, a neighbor said after it was all over, oh, yeah, I did used to see him and his older siblings pressed against the window, pleading to be let out. And I just thought, okay, so why didn't you let them out or like smash the fucking window? So I, and I get that it's hard. And I get that there's loads of legislation and stuff as well. I don't even know how to say that word. Is it legislation or legislation? Thank you. Legislation. I don't know if you remember Anna Klimby. That was quite a big case as well. It was in the news a few years ago. But anyway, she was eight. Killed by her mother and her mother's boyfriend. And she, let me just remember how many, yeah, she, in the post-mortem, she had 128 marks on her body, like current wounds, 128. And she had been in hospital, but they had concluded that they must have been accidental, like 128. So sometimes people are telling, because that was a friend had actually brought her to the hospital. So that's cool. But then you get there and you're like, hey, social worker, woohoo. And a police officer, and they came and then they went, ah, she's probably all right. Cause it's only 128. So it must be just like lots of falling down. She must be really dizzy kid. So yeah, that also pisses me off. There was another kid called Blake Fowler. He was seven. He was killed. It was a head injury. They found, they found some like a substance that's only in ceilings in his hair because he'd obviously been like bounced off the ceiling. But he was actually very vocal compared to a lot of the children and was often just coming into school. And like telling his teachers everything. He wasn't very kind of frightened of what that might do. He just like talk about it all the time. But another thing he would do is like beat the shit out of everyone. He was like seven and like this hard little fucker. And he never understood. Apparently the teacher said that he didn't get why he shouldn't. Cause he would just say, but this is what my dad does, you know? So yeah. So I'm just going to read some poems that are kind of about this topic. Is that okay? Yeah. Is that okay? Okay. So this is called At Risk. Oh, one more thing. In Ireland, the first year of primary school, what do you call that here again? Reception. It's called junior infants. You just need to know that. Okay. At Risk. He was forever stuffing junior infants in the bottom of the can machine. Like as if their sweetness meant they should be stored amongst the cokes. They seldom cried. Partly out of shock. Partly out of glimpsing fizzy drinks they regularly lifted from the fridge in gym. And then they would put their limbs into the trolley only to be scolded at the checkouts. He liked how cleanly some would fit and often removed their Velcroed shoes, arranging them in natural looking footstep formations leading to the base of the machine. And once a child was neatly tucked away, he would go back to class and be a better pupil, sharing out the crayons and remembering to use the red for hearts and not for shading head wounds. That's that. So here's the thing, right? That's what I think about all that stuff. And I've always sort of ranted about the fact that people should do something if they know it's something. I've always ranted quite a lot. I had an incident where I had my opportunity to do what I, you know, practice what I preach. And I, well, this is called Nothing Happens. Nothing Happened in Poundland. I should have stopped her. But I was busy stocking up on Toblerones and cheap cod liver oil to grease my bones. In the queue, I gasped in shock, nearly at the top, delving as I froze amid the overcrowded shelving for the courage to shout stop. But then the cashier shouted next. And I fell out of and in line and also short. Short of your very basic need for some protection. For bigger hands to bat the jerking ones away. For sharper teeth to cut through hisses with firm justice. For softer words instilling credence that if you were brave enough to come with me and tell on mummy, everything would be okay. I made small steps and sought an ally in the cashier. That woman strangling her toddler. Do you see? But he didn't even shrug. And me, I walked away. So I guess I'm just saying, don't walk away. Even if I tell you not to. And then I did. And that's me. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so it's a strange experience for performers, I think, doing stand-up tragedy. Like, if you're a comedian and you decide to do something serious, then it's a strange experience to not have laughs. And if you're a spoken word performer, it's even weirder. I'm sure you guys feel a bit strange too. Like, it's strange to clap a really sad thing, even if you enjoyed it. So well done, audience, and well done, Amy, for getting through that together. This is a place where I want people to be able to talk about those things which we normally don't talk about. And so I'm really pleased that that's what you decided to do, even if it is weird to give you two thumbs up, particularly after the set. Like, now I know how weird those two thumbs were. I feel strange. But that's okay. It's okay to feel strange. Now, our next performer is, he's doing, right, so he's basically at the moment doing an amazing show that I've sort of seen in works in progress versions of it. It's called Good Grief. And he is crowdfunding it through Ideas Tap until March the 16th. So if you can fund, help fund his show about grief, really, I would urge you to do so. You can find out more about it at www. thegoodgriefproject.com and put your hands together for our final Tragedian of the Night, Jack Rook! Thank you very much. See, I didn't even tell Dave to do a plug. It's like on this morning when they're like, and you can check them out on here. I wish my name was No Signal because then it would make this lovely little sign here. I'm a hip-hop artist. My name's No Signal. Thanks very much for coming. My name's Jack Rook, and I'm about to tell you, Amy said, like, she likes to write about boys and poo. I like to write about being fat and my dead dad. Anybody got a dead dad? Give me a holler. Woo! Oh, yeah, dead parents, dead the lot. Brilliant. Well, not brilliant, but I suppose you've got to make the best out of a shitty situation, which is pretty much what my show Good Grief is. I'm going to read you some bits and bobs from it. I stupidly had a prop to bring you all, and then I left it on the rail replacement bus, which I'm going to invoice the overground for that, really. But, yeah, so I'm going to read some bits and bobs to you. Is anybody familiar with a poet called Holly McNeish? Yeah? Yeah, we've got a few, yeah. So, she did this night once called An Evening with Death, and it was through the eyes of poets and doctors, which was quite an interesting one. And on one side of the stage, she had a sign saying, Before I Die, I Want To. And on the other side of the stage, it said, Before I Die, I Need To. So I decided to write something in response to that, and imaginatively, I decided to call it Before I Die. Before I die, I want to eat bounty bars, just to be controversial. I want to star in my own less corny version of the Match.com commercial. I want to go at Sainsbury's self-checkout tills with a sledgehammer. I want to be a drag queen called Nigella Farage. And I want to see Nigel change his name to Raj. I want to have rough, filthy sex with you all. With you all, especially you. You. You. Lady on your phone. Oh, so... You can hit me up on BBM, Twitter, or maybe even give me a go on Tinder. I want to drink more, eat less. I want to see Katie Hopkins down the street, so I can sit as arrest her for hate crimes against fat people. I want less Claudia and more Tess. I want to hear that girl on the tube say that she doesn't mind if her boyfriend cries, because if his best mate died, he'd be worried, surely, if he didn't shed some tears. I want to go walk about the 270-square-mile Orindee Game Reserve in Namibia with Ray Mears. I want to find out that secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. I want to take a shit outside of American Apparel and wipe my arse on a copy of Vice magazine. I want to make Dad proud. I want to make Mum proud. I want to make Dave Pickering proud. I want to throw up outside proud in Camden, because everybody out in Camden after 10pm is a bit of an arsehole. I want to not speak so loud during at least one occasion where volume is typically frowned upon, i.e. assemblies, church services, or the STI clinic. I want to go to the Harvester salad bar and not feel compelled to hide all the good stuff at the bottom of the bowl, like the little bacon bits, the crispy onion. Has anybody gone to Harvester and done this? Because you just feel self-conscious, like, oh, I'm eating all the fatty foods at the salad bar again. I want the cast of TOWIE to stay in Marbs. I want to learn sign language. I want to learn sign language and communicate with people who have totally different stories to tell. I want to help my mum to find her confidence again. I want to help my mum come out of her shell. I want to go into All Saints with a pack of highlighters and colour in all their dull, monochrome, wanky clothes. I want to understand what the hell PPI even is. I want to see suicide not be the biggest killer of young men who are gay or have lost a parent or who feel that they are happiest when asleep, and I really want to be on the pink team of supermarket sweep. I want to see all those who use the compound words mega lulz or amazeballs hung up upside down by their balls and dragged via a rusty iron chain down a German motorway. I want to see Jeremy Clarkson hung upside down by his balls and dragged via a rusty iron chain down a German motorway. I want to hear my generation realise that the word frape is not okay. I want to hear my generation not describe things that are a bit lame with the word gay. I want to see us bridge the gap between young and old and I want to stop being hassled by cash for gold. I want to form a punk band. Called Fuck the Limelight with Michelle from Destiny's Child. And the one who got chucked out the XX. I want to hear a Flo Rida song that doesn't sell sex. I want Vogue to apologise for the fact that from 2003 to 2013 there was not one single solo cover featuring a black female model. I want to see my new neighbour come out and speak to me because I picked up her post. And this is actually true. Her name is Molly Coddle. I want to see Assata Shakur be acquitted so she can leave political refuge in Cuba, drink cocktails on Miami Beach and teach the truth. But I really want to avoid Magaluf. I want to experience proof of aliens like in the Spice World movie. Has anyone seen it? Where Meat Loaf drives the tour bus and drops the girls all off for a slash. And then I want to basically tell the Martians to tell Jerry not to quit next year. I want to meet Dad for a beer and a dream so I don't forget him. I want to get slim but never walk into a gym. I want to finish off life full to the brim. But before I die, I suppose I just need to be happy. Thank you. So the reason I stumbled on a word is because halfway through performing I realised that I've got a piece of chewing gum in my mouth. And then I thought, what would the performer etiquette be of spitting out chewing gum in front of 30 people in acne into my mouth and hoping nobody saw? And then I realised you'd all see. So I'm going to keep it in as a bit of a task to perform and have chewing gum in my mouth. Okay? So if you see it, then maybe shout a word like BINGO! And then I'll come over and give you 20 quid. So fuck off Amy McAllister. I'll give you 20 quid anyway. I'm sure I hear you that. I'm going to do a poem. I'm going to do one more poem. What would you guys like? Should we do something? Right, I'm going to lift. Let's be high energy, closing act. And let's go for something that I think Amy would like. This poem is called Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. I really want to spit out this chewing gum. Do you know what I'm going to do? Right. Everybody just hum. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Because it was really distracting and I would have just ended up spitting it out at this gentleman here. This poem is called Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. Mum, my mum wants us to pay for an over-expensive chat with some snooty twat from Hertfordshire Bereavement Services. Her name is Mrs Gail Beresford Dale. She's pale with a Lego haircut that defies all acknowledged laws of gravity. She smells like strep and deep heat. Feet like horse's hooves. She's outrageously posh. Walks in our house dressed in what looks like a pair of curtains and I'm certain that she's older than mine and mum's combined age. Our counselling session begins and ever so frail Gail starts to wriggle in our armchair. Every time I stare mum pinches my knee. We start talking and Gail comes out with the age-old cliche, tell me how does that make you feel? Me and mum sit opposite her on the sofa surrounded by a mountain of unwashed mugs, a stack of used scratch cards, an ashtray full of dog ends, a TV guide where I've drawn moustaches on Peggy Mitchell and a list of 26 people on the telly we'd like to punch because they're too smug.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.8, "text": " The first thing I want to talk about is, I don't know if
