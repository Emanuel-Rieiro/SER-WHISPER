{"text": " Welcome to this Berkman Klein Center lunch special. There's a full house in the room and happily eating. There is a house of indeterminate dimension online. This is your warning that we are being webcast, so there is more surveillance even than usual going on here. You should be aware of that. I'm Jonathan Zittrin. I teach here. This is Monica Bickert visiting from Facebook. And we should also say, in a somewhat experimental vein, both for those in the room and online, if you go to brk.mn, I don't know why we don't like vowels. I think we just couldn't afford to buy them, slash hate versus debate, you can participate in the question tool as we go about. And at certain moments, I will shout out to somebody in the room, maybe Ellen, maybe Nikki Barasa. Is Nikki here? Nikki, who did some wonderful organizing and background research and work for the event. Thank you, Nikki, to see how folks are feeling in that bespoke question tool. So with that, I want to be able to introduce Monica and spend the balance of the hour observing the event. And I want to say that Monica probably has one of the most interesting and difficult jobs in the world. Part of what makes it difficult is that you don't see a lot of people playing violins in sympathy for the job's difficulty. And I'm hoping today to have a chance to understand more about the kinds of decisions she and the folks around her are confronted with day in, day out, week in, week out, as the So we have more than 2 billion people using this site. Any given day, it's more than 1.3 billion, I think. So if you think about the size of that, and also another interesting figure for most Americans to hear is that more than 85% of those people are outside the United States. So we're talking about dozens and dozens of languages and really large communities in places like India, Turkey, and Indonesia. And to an order of magnitude, how many posts are posted on Facebook in a day? Billions. I don't have an exact figure, but definitely billions. Carl Sagan level. And so when we're thinking about the content on the platform, it's certainly not the case that every piece of content that's going live on Facebook will be seen by somebody at Facebook. Normally, we really want that to be the case, but that is not the case at our scale. Got it. So is Charlie Nesson invoking the so-called ethos, logos, pathos. Ethos, where you're coming from, who you are. Here are just some brief details as head of global policy management and counterterrorism at Facebook. In charge of what types of content can be shared, how advertising develops can interact, the company's response to terrorist content online, and some of your background here, lead security counsel, resident legal advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, assistant U.S. attorney for 11 years in D.C. and Chicago, where you took on U.S. versus Austin and were awarded prosecutor of the year by the DEA? Yes, although if memory serves, I think there might have been others. I don't know that it was that big of a deal. It's kind of a participation trophy, yes. Everybody won in that one. And a graduate of this school, so welcome back. Thank you. It's always fun to come back here, especially to a building that didn't exist when I was here. Yeah, this used to be a parking lot and a really dangerous dorm. I remember that dorm. It was actually the most expensive dorm. And it had, I think the reason was because it had an elevator and it had air conditioning. But it didn't look very nice. I never went inside. Yes, Wyeth, for those who want to Google. Okay, so it's always good to start with a picture of an animal, but in this case, it may be ill-advised because I just want to put out a hypothetical to the group. Suppose the next frame of this is the dog receiving extremely bad news and then being beaten. And the dog is being abused. And photos of that go up on Facebook of a dog clearly in distress being hurt. I'm just curious, in the room, let me know with a hum if you would be inclined at the count of three to want to see that post of an abused dog deleted by the authorities at Facebook once it's been pointed out to them. Is that your beeper going off? It is. Actually, this is sort of funny. Sorry. But every morning, I don't know how to change the setting on this one. So it goes off every morning. This is the confidence-inspiring part of the... I'm very tech-savvy. This goes off every morning at 9, 16 a.m. I thought you were going to say it happens every time a new user signs up on Facebook. So... All right, so I'm asking at the count of three to hum if you would want to see these pictures of an abused dog being taken down. And they're put up without context, let's say, in this case. Distressed users see it, and they flag it. Do you want it taken down? One, two, three. How many people are saying, let it stand, do not take it down? One, two, three. Okay, so there's consensus in the room about that. Here is a page from a PowerPoint deck obtained by The Guardian. So its authenticity is, I suppose, open to challenge. Right. Okay, that's glass half full. I will say, for those of you who didn't see the... How many people in here saw The Guardian coverage of Facebook? Okay, a lot of people. So the thing that I thought was useful about their coverage was I think it highlighted how much goes into this process. I mean, there is not... You don't just tell your reviewers, animal abuse is bad. We have thousands of content reviewers sitting around the world, and as they're as content is reported and they're making these decisions, they have to have some very concrete guidance. So The Guardian published some documents that they said were Facebook's current standards. Some were, some weren't, but I think it does give sort of a general... So it's a snapshot in time of the standards of the sort that might go into a training. And can you give us a... Is there a certain background of... What do you call them? Content moderators? Content reviewers? Content reviewers. Content reviewers. We have one set of community standards. This is just for user-generated content. We can talk about ads and developer standards separately, but for user-generated content, we have one set of standards called our community standards, and that's a public-facing document. We have the ability to report content to Facebook. So you can report a page, a profile, a post, a comment. And then once that comment comes into us, it goes to one of our content reviewers. Now, we do use some technical terms. Technology to review reports. And I just... What's a good background for... If I want to be a content reviewer, I'm in the interview... Do you want to be one? Well, I'm open to it. I don't know. What does it pay? And what does it pay? Well, it depends. I mean, you have employees of all different levels that come into the company... I'm entry-level. And... Yeah, that seems about right. And the interview is like, so have you reviewed content before? Most people... And this is true with people that are on the policy team as well. A lot of people don't have a direct background in this. It's not... This isn't a field that has existed for very long. But is this like somebody straight out of college, for example? Like, first job? I... I can't say with specificity whether or not somebody would have this job right out of college. We do have some people who have subject matter expertise in various areas. So, you know, for instance, we have counterterrorism reviewers. We have self-harm reviewers. Some of them come into the job with expertise. Some don't. Some come in and are, yeah, your basic college graduate who then receives training in how to apply our policies. And I guess when I ask how much do they pay, it's probably just to discern, is this kind of like a minimum wage sort of... Feels like an assembly line. There's so many comments happening every moment. No, it's not. And we have seen coverage from time to time in the media where they'll say, oh, you know, Facebook has reviewers in the Philippines and they're not paid well. And you can go look at some of that coverage. We've always come out and said, here's, in fact, how they are paid. So, you know, these are... These are difficult jobs. They're serious jobs. And they're... I wouldn't want to... I wouldn't want to... Even the newest reviewer who is reviewing reports, let's say, of nudity that come in and is looking at those photos, those jobs have real meaning and are very difficult. So people go through pretty extensive training, not only when they start the job, but you have continuing training every week. We audit their performance. Each reviewer, every week, is audited by having a subset of their work re-reviewed. And then they have... Actually, they complete quizzes from time to time, especially... Our policies are always changing. So one of the reasons that when I said some of this stuff is accurate, some of it is not, is because our policies change constantly. We have... For lawyers in the room, we have almost like a little mini legislative kind of session. Every two weeks, where we discuss proposed policy changes. And that is with input from internal partners. You might have the legal team, the engineering team, the operations team, the public policy team in France and South Africa and Indonesia weighing in. At the same time, you also have input from external partners. We've reached out to the ACLU or CRIF in France or various groups. So these policies are constantly evolving, and the reviewers have to be trained on that. Got it. All right, so that's just up here how detailed it can be. This is another coverage of things. Facebook's secret censorship rules protect white men from hate speech but not black children. And that's because of this rule, which I don't know if it's still in place or if it was ever accurate. It was and is to some extent, and we can talk about this, the animal abuse thing real fast. Yes, sure. So I love that example because the animal abuse thing highlights the importance of context. So for us, if there is an animal abuse image, if somebody posts an image of this dog being beaten and says, isn't this so funny, we would remove that. But if things are shared sometimes explicitly to raise awareness or to condemn violence, we will allow it. Stop factory farming. And that is true with, you know, in the aftermath of a natural disaster or a terror attack, you may see imagery that's really upsetting. In Syria, we've seen a lot of images that have come out of Syria that are just heartbreaking. And we look at the context for how they're shared. That sounds kind of easy, right? Like if somebody says, ha ha, this is funny, take it down. And if they say, oh, this is awful, leave it up. But actually, it gets very complicated because if somebody shares an image, let's say you've got a bleeding body on the ground in Syria, and somebody shares it but doesn't leave a caption at all, what do you do? Or they say, wow, what do you do? And so it gets, this is the sort of thing where we don't have the offline context to know why this is being shared, and we have to make that decision with limited context. And it's also a really interesting moment to note that this is worlds away from what those of you who are in law school may have learned in constitutional law about how the First Amendment is applied. This is, I think, fair to say, absolutely viewpoint-based discrimination. It's a discrimination of the sort that if the state did it, it would be subject to the most searching of scrutiny. We do not follow the US legal model of the First Amendment for sure. And as those of you who are in law school know, the First Amendment does not apply to us. We're a private company. But we have our rules. The whole underlying philosophy behind our rules, our content standards, is that we want to create a place where people can come and feel safe expressing themselves. The community exists so you can connect to people you don't know. More than half of people using Facebook have friends in other countries, online. So it's a lot about trying to connect people. And you can't do that. They won't come, and they won't connect and share their opinions if they don't think it is a safe space. And that is something that we've seen play out time and time again with smaller apps via apps that were there years ago, where they were filled with a lot of harassment and hate, and people stopped using them. So that's something we're very aware of. And I think of our standards as being very responsive to what the community needs to feel comfortable coming to Facebook. Doesn't mean you're not going to see offensive content. It doesn't mean you're going to agree with what you see. But the idea is that people don't feel unsafe when they are there. DAVID BADER GINSBURG- So back to this. I don't know if it's worth trying to explicate. I'm going to try to complicate this slide by description. The next slide is the example that was given from The Guardian. KATHLEEN SULLIVAN JOHNSON- Yeah, actually, why don't we talk through this, and then we can go to the examples. So when we think about hate speech, again, not illegal under US law. It is illegal in many countries. We don't allow hate speech, but what the heck does that mean? Nobody, no two people seem to define this the same way. Our definition is if you are attacking a person or a group of people based on their protected characteristic. And we all have these protected characteristics. It's race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and so forth. And we list them in our standards. So if I were to attack Jonathan or attack a certain race or religious group, we would look to see what is the basis of that attack. If I'm saying I don't like this person because I don't like the way this person talks, or I don't like what this person is saying, that's different than saying I don't like this race of people. So again, it sounds pretty easy in concept. Whether you agree with where that line is drawn or not, it sounds pretty easy conceptually. But when you get into the business of trying to decide when exactly is somebody attacking based on a protected characteristic, it gets hard. So our standard rule was if you, can you go back? Yeah. If there is a protected category, so I say something about a specific religion, and it's an attack, meaning I am calling for disparate treatment of these people, I'm calling for discrimination, or I'm saying these people are bad or greedy or awful or dirty or whatever, then we would consider it hate speech and we would remove it. Okay. So then this is from, I gather, the training deck that the Guardian said. And it's meant to be counterintuitive to show how hard it is. So this is the quiz. Which of the below subsets do we protect among female drivers, black children, white men? The answer is white men, for which the follow-up question would be, riddle me that. And I can't, and by the way, I can't say that this specific slide is accurate, but the underlying point would be accurate, which is not anymore. We've changed this policy. At the time that the piece ran with this deck in it, our policy was if there is inclusion of some other characteristic that is not a protected characteristic, then it is no longer an attack. So for instance... So in the first it was drivers, in the second it was youth. Right. Now the theory behind that is if you're, you know, I might say something like, you know, I'm American, but I might say something like, gosh, American moviegoers are so annoying, they always talk during the movie. I'm talking about moviegoers. I'm not talking about, I mean, they happen to be American because I'm in the U.S., but I don't hate Americans. It's really about the moviegoing experience. That was the theory under that. I think what we've seen, and I think that the conversation that follows sessions like this is that you end up talking about these standards and saying, I don't know, maybe we need to refine that. And that is something that we concluded. So when you look at these examples, drivers was a non-protected characteristic. Children was a non-protected characteristic. But race and gender are both protected characteristics. And sometimes with training, with training, with the index, those are constructed by the review team's management to make sure that they're not bringing their own bias to the table, that instead they're thinking objectively about the policies. And if it's, you know, if it is race and it is religion, then, or race and gender, then we take it down, even when you look at something and say, well, I personally would feel sympathy for this other image. One of the things that we concluded after that was that if people are saying children or adults, talking about age or life stage, then that was something that we were going to consider protected when paired with a protected characteristic. So now both of those two would be, that would be considered hate speech under our policies. When we introduce other characteristics like occupation, teacher, driver, or the moviegoer example, things get more complicated. And we're, that policy is very much under discussion right now. And we're testing different things. I mean, one of the, one of the interesting things about being at a technology company is you can test these policies before you take them live. And we try to do that before we launch policies. We try to do a test where we're actually marking content and then seeing what results that would lead to, not taking that action, but marking that and then looking, doing sort of a blind marking and looking to see how does that affect outcomes.", "segments": [{"start": 4.4, "end": 5.6, "text": " Welcome to this Berkman Klein", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [4027, 281, 341, 5637, 74, 1601, 33327],

There's a full house in the room and happily eating. There is a house of indeterminate dimension online. This is your warning that we are being webcast, so there is more surveillance even than usual going on here. You should be aware of that. I'm Jonathan Zittrin. I teach here. This is Monica Bickert visiting from Facebook. And we should also say, in a somewhat experimental vein, both for those in the room and online, if you go to brk.mn, I don't know why we don't like vowels. I think we just couldn't afford to buy them, slash hate versus debate, you can participate in the question tool as we go about. And at certain moments, I will shout out to somebody in the room, maybe Ellen, maybe Nikki Barasa. Is Nikki here? Nikki, who did some wonderful organizing and background research and work for the event. Thank you, Nikki, to see how folks are feeling in that bespoke question tool. So with that, I want to be able to introduce Monica and spend the balance of the hour observing the event. And I want to say that Monica probably has one of the most interesting and difficult jobs in the world. Part of what makes it difficult is that you don't see a lot of people playing violins in sympathy for the job's difficulty. And I'm hoping today to have a chance to understand more about the kinds of decisions she and the folks around her are confronted with day in, day out, week in, week out, as the So we have more than 2 billion people using this site. Any given day, it's more than 1.3 billion, I think. So if you think about the size of that, and also another interesting figure for most Americans to hear is that more than 85% of those people are outside the United States. So we're talking about dozens and dozens of languages and really large communities in places like India, Turkey, and Indonesia. And to an order of magnitude, how many posts are posted on Facebook in a day? Billions. I don't have an exact figure, but definitely billions. Carl Sagan level. And so when we're thinking about the content on the platform, it's certainly not the case that every piece of content that's going live on Facebook will be seen by somebody at Facebook. Normally, we really want that to be the case, but that is not the case at our scale. Got it. So is Charlie Nesson invoking the so-called ethos, logos, pathos. Ethos, where you're coming from, who you are. Here are just some brief details as head of global policy management and counterterrorism at Facebook. In charge of what types of content can be shared, how advertising develops can interact, the company's response to terrorist content online, and some of your background here, lead security counsel, resident legal advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, assistant U.S. attorney for 11 years in D.C. and Chicago, where you took on U.S. versus Austin and were awarded prosecutor of the year by the DEA? Yes, although if memory serves, I think there might have been others. I don't know that it was that big of a deal. It's kind of a participation trophy, yes. Everybody won in that one. And a graduate of this school, so welcome back. Thank you. It's always fun to come back here, especially to a building that didn't exist when I was here. Yeah, this used to be a parking lot and a really dangerous dorm. I remember that dorm. It was actually the most expensive dorm. And it had, I think the reason was because it had an elevator and it had air conditioning. But it didn't look very nice. I never went inside. Yes, Wyeth, for those who want to Google. Okay, so it's always good to start with a picture of an animal, but in this case, it may be ill-advised because I just want to put out a hypothetical to the group. Suppose the next frame of this is the dog receiving extremely bad news and then being beaten. And the dog is being abused. And photos of that go up on Facebook of a dog clearly in distress being hurt. I'm just curious, in the room, let me know with a hum if you would be inclined at the count of three to want to see that post of an abused dog deleted by the authorities at Facebook once it's been pointed out to them. Is that your beeper going off? It is. Actually, this is sort of funny. Sorry. But every morning, I don't know how to change the setting on this one. So it goes off every morning. This is the confidence-inspiring part of the... I'm very tech-savvy. This goes off every morning at 9, 16 a.m. I thought you were going to say it happens every time a new user signs up on Facebook. So... All right, so I'm asking at the count of three to hum if you would want to see these pictures of an abused dog being taken down. And they're put up without context, let's say, in this case. Distressed users see it, and they flag it. Do you want it taken down? One, two, three. How many people are saying, let it stand, do not take it down? One, two, three. Okay, so there's consensus in the room about that. Here is a page from a PowerPoint deck obtained by The Guardian. So its authenticity is, I suppose, open to challenge. Right. Okay, that's glass half full. I will say, for those of you who didn't see the... How many people in here saw The Guardian coverage of Facebook? Okay, a lot of people. So the thing that I thought was useful about their coverage was I think it highlighted how much goes into this process. I mean, there is not... You don't just tell your reviewers, animal abuse is bad. We have thousands of content reviewers sitting around the world, and as they're as content is reported and they're making these decisions, they have to have some very concrete guidance. So The Guardian published some documents that they said were Facebook's current standards. Some were, some weren't, but I think it does give sort of a general... So it's a snapshot in time of the standards of the sort that might go into a training. And can you give us a... Is there a certain background of... What do you call them? Content moderators? Content reviewers? Content reviewers. Content reviewers. We have one set of community standards. This is just for user-generated content. We can talk about ads and developer standards separately, but for user-generated content, we have one set of standards called our community standards, and that's a public-facing document. We have the ability to report content to Facebook. So you can report a page, a profile, a post, a comment. And then once that comment comes into us, it goes to one of our content reviewers. Now, we do use some technical terms. Technology to review reports. And I just... What's a good background for... If I want to be a content reviewer, I'm in the interview... Do you want to be one? Well, I'm open to it. I don't know. What does it pay? And what does it pay? Well, it depends. I mean, you have employees of all different levels that come into the company... I'm entry-level. And... Yeah, that seems about right. And the interview is like, so have you reviewed content before? Most people... And this is true with people that are on the policy team as well. A lot of people don't have a direct background in this. It's not... This isn't a field that has existed for very long. But is this like somebody straight out of college, for example? Like, first job? I... I can't say with specificity whether or not somebody would have this job right out of college. We do have some people who have subject matter expertise in various areas. So, you know, for instance, we have counterterrorism reviewers. We have self-harm reviewers. Some of them come into the job with expertise. Some don't. Some come in and are, yeah, your basic college graduate who then receives training in how to apply our policies. And I guess when I ask how much do they pay, it's probably just to discern, is this kind of like a minimum wage sort of... Feels like an assembly line. There's so many comments happening every moment. No, it's not. And we have seen coverage from time to time in the media where they'll say, oh, you know, Facebook has reviewers in the Philippines and they're not paid well. And you can go look at some of that coverage. We've always come out and said, here's, in fact, how they are paid. So, you know, these are... These are difficult jobs. They're serious jobs. And they're... I wouldn't want to... I wouldn't want to... Even the newest reviewer who is reviewing reports, let's say, of nudity that come in and is looking at those photos, those jobs have real meaning and are very difficult. So people go through pretty extensive training, not only when they start the job, but you have continuing training every week. We audit their performance. Each reviewer, every week, is audited by having a subset of their work re-reviewed. And then they have... Actually, they complete quizzes from time to time, especially... Our policies are always changing. So one of the reasons that when I said some of this stuff is accurate, some of it is not, is because our policies change constantly. We have... For lawyers in the room, we have almost like a little mini legislative kind of session. Every two weeks, where we discuss proposed policy changes. And that is with input from internal partners. You might have the legal team, the engineering team, the operations team, the public policy team in France and South Africa and Indonesia weighing in. At the same time, you also have input from external partners. We've reached out to the ACLU or CRIF in France or various groups. So these policies are constantly evolving, and the reviewers have to be trained on that. Got it. All right, so that's just up here how detailed it can be. This is another coverage of things. Facebook's secret censorship rules protect white men from hate speech but not black children. And that's because of this rule, which I don't know if it's still in place or if it was ever accurate. It was and is to some extent, and we can talk about this, the animal abuse thing real fast. Yes, sure. So I love that example because the animal abuse thing highlights the importance of context. So for us, if there is an animal abuse image, if somebody posts an image of this dog being beaten and says, isn't this so funny, we would remove that. But if things are shared sometimes explicitly to raise awareness or to condemn violence, we will allow it. Stop factory farming. And that is true with, you know, in the aftermath of a natural disaster or a terror attack, you may see imagery that's really upsetting. In Syria, we've seen a lot of images that have come out of Syria that are just heartbreaking. And we look at the context for how they're shared. That sounds kind of easy, right? Like if somebody says, ha ha, this is funny, take it down. And if they say, oh, this is awful, leave it up. But actually, it gets very complicated because if somebody shares an image, let's say you've got a bleeding body on the ground in Syria, and somebody shares it but doesn't leave a caption at all, what do you do? Or they say, wow, what do you do? And so it gets, this is the sort of thing where we don't have the offline context to know why this is being shared, and we have to make that decision with limited context. And it's also a really interesting moment to note that this is worlds away from what those of you who are in law school may have learned in constitutional law about how the First Amendment is applied. This is, I think, fair to say, absolutely viewpoint-based discrimination. It's a discrimination of the sort that if the state did it, it would be subject to the most searching of scrutiny. We do not follow the US legal model of the First Amendment for sure. And as those of you who are in law school know, the First Amendment does not apply to us. We're a private company. But we have our rules. The whole underlying philosophy behind our rules, our content standards, is that we want to create a place where people can come and feel safe expressing themselves. The community exists so you can connect to people you don't know. More than half of people using Facebook have friends in other countries, online. So it's a lot about trying to connect people. And you can't do that. They won't come, and they won't connect and share their opinions if they don't think it is a safe space. And that is something that we've seen play out time and time again with smaller apps via apps that were there years ago, where they were filled with a lot of harassment and hate, and people stopped using them. So that's something we're very aware of. And I think of our standards as being very responsive to what the community needs to feel comfortable coming to Facebook. Doesn't mean you're not going to see offensive content. It doesn't mean you're going to agree with what you see. But the idea is that people don't feel unsafe when they are there. DAVID BADER GINSBURG- So back to this. I don't know if it's worth trying to explicate. I'm going to try to complicate this slide by description. The next slide is the example that was given from The Guardian. KATHLEEN SULLIVAN JOHNSON- Yeah, actually, why don't we talk through this, and then we can go to the examples. So when we think about hate speech, again, not illegal under US law. It is illegal in many countries. We don't allow hate speech, but what the heck does that mean? Nobody, no two people seem to define this the same way. Our definition is if you are attacking a person or a group of people based on their protected characteristic. And we all have these protected characteristics. It's race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and so forth. And we list them in our standards. So if I were to attack Jonathan or attack a certain race or religious group, we would look to see what is the basis of that attack. If I'm saying I don't like this person because I don't like the way this person talks, or I don't like what this person is saying, that's different than saying I don't like this race of people. So again, it sounds pretty easy in concept. Whether you agree with where that line is drawn or not, it sounds pretty easy conceptually. But when you get into the business of trying to decide when exactly is somebody attacking based on a protected characteristic, it gets hard. So our standard rule was if you, can you go back? Yeah. If there is a protected category, so I say something about a specific religion, and it's an attack, meaning I am calling for disparate treatment of these people, I'm calling for discrimination, or I'm saying these people are bad or greedy or awful or dirty or whatever, then we would consider it hate speech and we would remove it. Okay. So then this is from, I gather, the training deck that the Guardian said. And it's meant to be counterintuitive to show how hard it is. So this is the quiz. Which of the below subsets do we protect among female drivers, black children, white men? The answer is white men, for which the follow-up question would be, riddle me that. And I can't, and by the way, I can't say that this specific slide is accurate, but the underlying point would be accurate, which is not anymore. We've changed this policy. At the time that the piece ran with this deck in it, our policy was if there is inclusion of some other characteristic that is not a protected characteristic, then it is no longer an attack. So for instance... So in the first it was drivers, in the second it was youth. Right. Now the theory behind that is if you're, you know, I might say something like, you know, I'm American, but I might say something like, gosh, American moviegoers are so annoying, they always talk during the movie. I'm talking about moviegoers. I'm not talking about, I mean, they happen to be American because I'm in the U.S., but I don't hate Americans. It's really about the moviegoing experience. That was the theory under that. I think what we've seen, and I think that the conversation that follows sessions like this is that you end up talking about these standards and saying, I don't know, maybe we need to refine that. And that is something that we concluded. So when you look at these examples, drivers was a non-protected characteristic. Children was a non-protected characteristic. But race and gender are both protected characteristics. And sometimes with training, with training, with the index, those are constructed by the review team's management to make sure that they're not bringing their own bias to the table, that instead they're thinking objectively about the policies. And if it's, you know, if it is race and it is religion, then, or race and gender, then we take it down, even when you look at something and say, well, I personally would feel sympathy for this other image. One of the things that we concluded after that was that if people are saying children or adults, talking about age or life stage, then that was something that we were going to consider protected when paired with a protected characteristic. So now both of those two would be, that would be considered hate speech under our policies. When we introduce other characteristics like occupation, teacher, driver, or the moviegoer example, things get more complicated. And we're, that policy is very much under discussion right now. And we're testing different things. I mean, one of the, one of the interesting things about being at a technology company is you can test these policies before you take them live. And we try to do that before we launch policies. We try to do a test where we're actually marking content and then seeing what results that would lead to, not taking that action, but marking that and then looking, doing sort of a blind marking and looking to see how does that affect outcomes.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 4.4, "end": 8.3, "text": " Welcome to this Berkman Klein Center lunch special.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [4027, 281, 341,
