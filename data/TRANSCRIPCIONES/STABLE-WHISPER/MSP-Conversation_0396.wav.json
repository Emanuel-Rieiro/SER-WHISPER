{"text": " And I watched this, and Chris Wallace came back at him because he didn't answer the question. And he never answered the question. Oh, I have a follow-up, too. I recorded every damn bit of it. He never answered the question. He never did. None of it. Nope. As close as he came, in terms of offering proof, is I've been to the border, and I know people who say. In other words, there was no offer of evidence of proof or anything in terms of Chris Wallace's question. And the thing is, okay, my first point with this is nobody would be talking about this if I hadn't brought it. Are you fucking out of your mind? The GOP has immigration on the brain. That's a lot of all they got left. Illegals, illegals, illegals, illegals. In a sense, build the dang fence was uttered by John McCain in his reelection campaign. Well, and Tom. Next time, we're going to build a gigantic crater across. Sure, the electric fence. What about the electric fence with alligators that Herman Cain wanted? Jesus Christ. This has been going on forever. And Tom, even so much that the illegal immigrant thing, it was years ago, we're like, on the left, no. People aren't illegal. They're undocumented. They're undocumented immigrants, is what they are. That's what we prefer to call them. So Donald Trump did not fucking invent this. No, and no one ever comes close to the question, of demand when it comes to narcotics from the U.S. side. Yeah. Or never demand. There would be no illegal drug trade were it not for the voracious demand on the U.S. side for narcotics. And demand when it comes to labor, too. If there wasn't the hope and the possibility of even minimal wage labor opportunities made by unscrupulous employers, who just want undocumented workers in order to shave a few bucks here and there, yeah, it wouldn't be nearly as bad. Absolutely. But we've become such a service society where we have people basically wiping our asses now. Raising their kids. It's ridiculous. Doing our gardening. Well, I'm not going to let the cat do it. I mean, do you ever, does anybody ever see a kid out mowing their fucking lawn? No. Oh, yeah, I do. I do here. God. My neighbor's kids mow their lawn. Nobody here does. No. Fiddle-dee-dee, Dad. Are you kidding me? They don't even own a lawnmower. You know? Yeah. No, their teenage girl would mow anybody's lawn. She's like a mowing. I remember being nine and mowing the lawn. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But anyway, let's get to part two where Trump totally evades the question. And Pete, you were totally right because the name of this clip is Trump Evades Immigration. But yeah, listen to this. Wallace with the follow-up and Trump with the evasion. What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? 30 seconds. Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening. Who? Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what's happening whether you like it or not. It's your stupid mind. Stupid, stupid. Jesus. That is just the butt-ignorant answer of the century. People I talk to, people I deal with, there are some that have said. Oh, yeah. Did you see him down in dealing with border guards? He deals with them. Oh, I deal with them tremendously. Tremendously. And it's very good. It's great. Yeah. And the Hispanics love me. Yeah. And you know what I heard him say today? I didn't have a chance to record any of the responses. But he said on one of the, I think Morning Joe or something today, he said, you know, when I got off stage, someone from the debate came up to me and they said that question was so unfair. They all came up to me and they said, oh, yeah, I'm sure Rand Paul was right there saying, oh, that was so unfair, man. I'm sure. I'm sure. Chris Christie was there, you know, wobbling his L's saying, you know, you know, he couldn't believe it. So, but really insane. Anyway, let's see. We have time for a few more. Here's another one. One from. Oh, yeah. This is the one clip from Kasich. I just wanted to vomit. Of course, Kasich. Here's Kasich buttering Donald Trump's sticky bun. Here you go. Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump, but I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you'd say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals that were being bamboozled. Is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration? Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken. We need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're going to if we're really going to learn it. Here's the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump's hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for him. And for people that want to just tune them out, they're making a mistake. Now, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hadn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the the state of Ohio from an eight billion dollar hole in the three hundred fifty thousand job loss to a two billion dollar surplus and a gain of three hundred fifty thousand jobs. Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration? But the point is, is that we all have solutions. We all have a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it. We all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are. All right. There you go. Seriously. You know, the case, it did so well. But for him to to smooch up to Trump like that was disgusting. That was disgusting. You know, I'm smelling a little bit of VP. Yeah, I think he was throwing a little meat to the animals so that he could get through the rest of his statement. But, you know, I could be wrong on that. Well, you know, I mean, you know, to say to say anything about, you know, that I mean, you know, to imply anything other than Donald Trump has touched a nerve with the radical Republican base would be naive. And to just say it out loud is like is to is to acknowledge, you know, the the conventional wisdom of the crazy people. So he acknowledged that. And then he that he went on from there. And I don't think his his response was terribly unreasonable. I really don't. Well, but the whole thing with within a Republican context. But but, Deb, go ahead. You were going to say something to Deba. I just I was just quoting Francie. She said, may I? I slap Trump's wig. Yeah. By the way, Chris Christie has one large buttock. He does not have two. Oh, well, he doesn't really look that cool in a baseball out. He has a handsome camel toe out there. He has a handsome camel toe. I'll give him that. He can sport a camel toe like, you know, he can sport a camel toe like no governor I've ever seen in tight fitting white pants. He poops through a sphincter near his neck. Oh, and here's the thing. OK, Tom, you remember the church scene and in Blazing Saddles where Howard Johnson's right. You know, that kind of thing. That what that statement Kasich made there kind of set it off. He was like, you know, given credit to Donald Trump. But then Rubio has a response. And he's like, John Kasich's right. It's about Howard Johnson being right. Yeah, exactly. So it's a way of avoiding mentioning Trump. But, you know, saying, well, you know, well, Donald Trump, he lit a fire under a bunch of bigots, assholes. And now, you know, he's he's doing good. Get her done. You know, I'm figuring their logic was to, you know, hand him a marshmallows and keep him chewing on that while they get their talking points out. Yeah, really. So this is the this is the Blazing Saddles. Howard Johnson is right. Moment here from from Rubio. But then Rubio kind of spins it around to make it an underhand, underhanded little remark towards Trump. Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid? Their leaders are smart. And all of these illegals coming over are criminals. Well, let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that, too. And that's why you need an E-Verify system and you need an entry exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with a gun case that Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people in the world. A year who legally immigrate to the United States and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we are being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States and they paid their fees and they hired a lawyer and they can't get in and they're wondering maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed. And otherwise, we're going to keep talking about it. We're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years like we have for the last 30 years. Rubio says, yeah, I love that. That's just a beautiful thing. I think Rubio handed himself well. I think so too. I thought he had his facts straight. Well, you didn't see the end. You didn't see the end when he said Democrats were godless.

And he never answered the question. Oh, I have a follow-up, too. I recorded every damn bit of it. He never answered the question. He never did. None of it. Nope. As close as he came, in terms of offering proof, is I've been to the border, and I know people who say. In other words, there was no offer of evidence of proof or anything in terms of Chris Wallace's question. And the thing is, okay, my first point with this is nobody would be talking about this if I hadn't brought it. Are you fucking out of your mind? The GOP has immigration on the brain. That's a lot of all they got left. Illegals, illegals, illegals, illegals. In a sense, build the dang fence was uttered by John McCain in his reelection campaign. Well, and Tom. Next time, we're going to build a gigantic crater across. Sure, the electric fence. What about the electric fence with alligators that Herman Cain wanted? Jesus Christ. This has been going on forever. And Tom, even so much that the illegal immigrant thing, it was years ago, we're like, on the left, no. People aren't illegal. They're undocumented. They're undocumented immigrants, is what they are. That's what we prefer to call them. So Donald Trump did not fucking invent this. No, and no one ever comes close to the question, of demand when it comes to narcotics from the U.S. side. Yeah. Or never demand. There would be no illegal drug trade were it not for the voracious demand on the U.S. side for narcotics. And demand when it comes to labor, too. If there wasn't the hope and the possibility of even minimal wage labor opportunities made by unscrupulous employers, who just want undocumented workers in order to shave a few bucks here and there, yeah, it wouldn't be nearly as bad. Absolutely. But we've become such a service society where we have people basically wiping our asses now. Raising their kids. It's ridiculous. Doing our gardening. Well, I'm not going to let the cat do it. I mean, do you ever, does anybody ever see a kid out mowing their fucking lawn? No. Oh, yeah, I do. I do here. God. My neighbor's kids mow their lawn. Nobody here does. No. Fiddle-dee-dee, Dad. Are you kidding me? They don't even own a lawnmower. You know? Yeah. No, their teenage girl would mow anybody's lawn. She's like a mowing. I remember being nine and mowing the lawn. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But anyway, let's get to part two where Trump totally evades the question. And Pete, you were totally right because the name of this clip is Trump Evades Immigration. But yeah, listen to this. Wallace with the follow-up and Trump with the evasion. What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? 30 seconds. Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening. Who? Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what's happening whether you like it or not. It's your stupid mind. Stupid, stupid. Jesus. That is just the butt-ignorant answer of the century. People I talk to, people I deal with, there are some that have said. Oh, yeah. Did you see him down in dealing with border guards? He deals with them. Oh, I deal with them tremendously. Tremendously. And it's very good. It's great. Yeah. And the Hispanics love me. Yeah. And you know what I heard him say today? I didn't have a chance to record any of the responses. But he said on one of the, I think Morning Joe or something today, he said, you know, when I got off stage, someone from the debate came up to me and they said that question was so unfair. They all came up to me and they said, oh, yeah, I'm sure Rand Paul was right there saying, oh, that was so unfair, man. I'm sure. I'm sure. Chris Christie was there, you know, wobbling his L's saying, you know, you know, he couldn't believe it. So, but really insane. Anyway, let's see. We have time for a few more. Here's another one. One from. Oh, yeah. This is the one clip from Kasich. I just wanted to vomit. Of course, Kasich. Here's Kasich buttering Donald Trump's sticky bun. Here you go. Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump, but I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you'd say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals that were being bamboozled. Is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration? Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken. We need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're going to if we're really going to learn it. Here's the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump's hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for him. And for people that want to just tune them out, they're making a mistake. Now, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hadn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the the state of Ohio from an eight billion dollar hole in the three hundred fifty thousand job loss to a two billion dollar surplus and a gain of three hundred fifty thousand jobs. Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration? But the point is, is that we all have solutions. We all have a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it. We all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are. All right. There you go. Seriously. You know, the case, it did so well. But for him to to smooch up to Trump like that was disgusting. That was disgusting. You know, I'm smelling a little bit of VP. Yeah, I think he was throwing a little meat to the animals so that he could get through the rest of his statement. But, you know, I could be wrong on that. Well, you know, I mean, you know, to say to say anything about, you know, that I mean, you know, to imply anything other than Donald Trump has touched a nerve with the radical Republican base would be naive. And to just say it out loud is like is to is to acknowledge, you know, the the conventional wisdom of the crazy people. So he acknowledged that. And then he that he went on from there. And I don't think his his response was terribly unreasonable. I really don't. Well, but the whole thing with within a Republican context. But but, Deb, go ahead. You were going to say something to Deba. I just I was just quoting Francie. She said, may I? I slap Trump's wig. Yeah. By the way, Chris Christie has one large buttock. He does not have two. Oh, well, he doesn't really look that cool in a baseball out. He has a handsome camel toe out there. He has a handsome camel toe. I'll give him that. He can sport a camel toe like, you know, he can sport a camel toe like no governor I've ever seen in tight fitting white pants. He poops through a sphincter near his neck. Oh, and here's the thing. OK, Tom, you remember the church scene and in Blazing Saddles where Howard Johnson's right. You know, that kind of thing. That what that statement Kasich made there kind of set it off. He was like, you know, given credit to Donald Trump. But then Rubio has a response. And he's like, John Kasich's right. It's about Howard Johnson being right. Yeah, exactly. So it's a way of avoiding mentioning Trump. But, you know, saying, well, you know, well, Donald Trump, he lit a fire under a bunch of bigots, assholes. And now, you know, he's he's doing good. Get her done. You know, I'm figuring their logic was to, you know, hand him a marshmallows and keep him chewing on that while they get their talking points out. Yeah, really. So this is the this is the Blazing Saddles. Howard Johnson is right. Moment here from from Rubio. But then Rubio kind of spins it around to make it an underhand, underhanded little remark towards Trump. Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid? Their leaders are smart. And all of these illegals coming over are criminals. Well, let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that, too. And that's why you need an E-Verify system and you need an entry exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with a gun case that Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people in the world. A year who legally immigrate to the United States and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we are being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States and they paid their fees and they hired a lawyer and they can't get in and they're wondering maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed. And otherwise, we're going to keep talking about it. We're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years like we have for the last 30 years. Rubio says, yeah, I love that. That's just a beautiful thing. I think Rubio handed himself well. I think so too. I thought he had his facts straight. Well, you didn't see the end. You didn't see the end when he said Democrats were godless.
