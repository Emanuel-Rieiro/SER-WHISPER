{"text": " I'm Bonnie Faulkner. Today we're featuring Michael C. Rupert, publisher and editor of From the Wilderness Publications on The Truth and Lies of 9-11. The following is from a presentation Rupert gave on February 21st in San Francisco. This is the seventh lecture that I have given in the 9-11 series. I want to leave you tonight with the message that your lives and your liberty are on the line now. There is no more opportunity for armchair discussion. There is no more time. The philosophy with which I started publishing From the Wilderness four years ago was very simple. I don't publish anything that I can't document. I don't ask you to take anything that I write on faith. I will offer opinions and I'll tell you their opinions. I'll give you my analysis. But I don't make any assertions unless I tell you where I got the information so that you can go find it for yourself. And I have taken on some very big names in four years. I won't go through the litany. I have never been sued because truth is an absolute defense against libel. Absolutely. All the time. What I'm doing tonight is I'm presenting to you exactly the same way that I would present if I were a detective talking to a district attorney or if I were an attorney talking to a grand jury. I'm presenting a case with the evidence. I will not speculate. There's no There's a lot of things we're not going to talk about tonight which can't be proven. Were there explosives in the building? Were the airplanes flown by remote control? All these cul-de-sacs that you can't go into that I can't produce proof for, I don't care. They're irrelevant. My job is to reach the people out there who haven't been reached with those facts that shake the foundation of their belief that they're the fundamentally most blessed people on the planet enjoying a standard of living because God loves America above all other peoples in the world which is what George Bush sells. I have to shake their belief in the system and you don't do that with speculation. Now there's some things that I have to tell you before we start talking about September the 11th. If you don't understand these things you will never understand completely why September the 11th happened. One is drugs and the other is oil. If you're in the U.S. government in the executive branch and somebody working under you commits a crime there is a law in Title 18 U.S. Code that says you have to turn in your employees if they're committing crimes. You have to call the Justice Department. You have to call the FBI and report the criminal activity. Well they knew that. It's a law. So they had a negotiation. In this negotiation which was between William French Smith which you can barely read down here that's Reagan's first Attorney General which you can read boy there's an oxymoron the Honorable William J. Casey Director of Central Intelligence in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures. Let me let that sink in for a minute. The Attorney General has just notified the head of the CIA that he no longer has to tell the Department of Justice when his people are dealing drugs. There it is in black and white. Proof of a conspiracy. Right there. By the way do you know who negotiated this memorandum for William French Smith? Ken Starr. Now there's one reason and one reason only why the CIA deals drugs. Not to fund covert operations. Not to make George Bush rich. But to support the U.S. economy. June 27th 1999 New York Stock Exchange Chief meets Colombian top rebel commander Bogota. A guy by the name of Dick Grasso flies to Bogota and meets with the FARC guerrillas. Now everybody knows in Colombia right everybody deals drugs right? Everybody. Left, right, center, government, paramilitaries they all deal drugs. And what Dick Grasso said when he was meeting with the FARC commander was will you please invest your drug money in Wall Street? That's what he said. It's in the story right there. He didn't say drug money but he said let us manage your funds and it's you know everybody knows the only way that FARC makes money is by taxing the cocaine trade. Black and white. Didn't hear that on Peter Jennings did you? Okay so he's asking for money to Wall Street and you know what the FARC guys told him? They said no senor. A year later President Bill Clinton announces Plan Colombia. You know and we since displaced two million people from their homes by spraying glyphosate from Monsanto and we're spraying food crops of course and we're just driving the cocaine production onto lands controlled by the paramilitaries and we're getting ready to go to war in Colombia again because there's oil there. Let's stay on the drug theme for a minute. In January of last year Senator Carl Levin of Michigan author of a minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Correspondent Banking and this is a copy of this is the first page of the report I just wanted to show you what the report looks like. If you go down at the bottom it says inattention and disinterest by U.S. banks in screening the foreign banks they take in as clients have allowed rogue foreign banks and their criminal clients to carry on money laundering and other criminal activities in the United States and yes that's true and to protect the narcotics industry and then if you read the report a little bit further it says J.P. Morgan who was by the way the largest creditor of Enron Bank of America Citigroup and First Union are laundering all this drug money it says down here one trillion trillion laundered annually. That's from the U.S. Senate and it says but I saw this back in May when Citibank Citigroup by the way who's on the board of directors at Citigroup John Deutsch the former CIA director Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs former secretary of the treasury a woman named Nora Slatkin the former CIA executive director that's the number three position they paid 12 billion dollars to buy Banco Nacional de Mexico Banamex second largest bank in Mexico it is an overt open drug money laundering bank in Mexico so overt that a brilliant Mexican newspaper named Porresto wrote a story about two years ago about the bank's owner Roberto Hernandez he owns most of the Yucatan Peninsula in fact the natives refer to it as the cocaine peninsula there's landing strips all over the place there's refueling for boats and they published all this and they're documenting that Hernandez was a major drug trafficker by the way in August of 2000 Bill Clinton vacationed for 10 days on Hernandez's property President-elect Vicente Fox the first day after winning the election paid a courtesy call on Roberto Hernandez Roberto Hernandez shared a media consultant with George W. Bush Hernandez now sits on the board of directors with Robert Rubin John Deutsch at Citigroup they don't care if you know how criminal they are anymore they are laughing at you and they hold the rest of the American people in utter contempt let's take a little look at CIA and Wall Street the National Security Act of 1947 was written by Clark Clifford an aide to Harry Truman longtime Democratic Party powerhouse he wrote the act that created the CIA who can tell me what his profession was Wall Street lawyer and banker as a matter of fact Clark Clifford is the American who brought the Bank of Credit and Commerce International BCCI onto American shores okay BCCI was a huge drug money laundering bank now the CIA was designed for Clifford by two brothers John Foster and Alan Dulles John Foster was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower Alan Dulles was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower John Foster was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower Dulles was DCI get used to the term Director of Central Intelligence DCI from 53 to 61 John Kennedy fired him after the Bay of Pigs what was their profession Wall Street lawyers from the firm Sullivan and Cromwell the most powerful law firm wouldn't we agree on that on Wall Street by the way who is who are Enron's attorneys Sullivan and Cromwell okay Bill Casey most of us are old enough to remember Iran Contra what was Bill Casey's job for Richard Nixon he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Stanley Sporkin retired recently as a US District Court judge in Washington DC CIA General Counsel in the 1980s what was his job before he was the CIA General Counsel he was General Counsel of the SEC David Daugherty who was the CIA General Counsel after Stanley Sporkin anybody know what he does now gonna

Bonnie Faulkner. Today we're featuring Michael C. Rupert, publisher and editor of From the Wilderness Publications on The Truth and Lies of 9-11. The following is from a presentation Rupert gave on February 21st in San Francisco. This is the seventh lecture that I have given in the 9-11 series. I want to leave you tonight with the message that your lives and your liberty are on the line now. There is no more opportunity for armchair discussion. There is no more time. The philosophy with which I started publishing From the Wilderness four years ago was very simple. I don't publish anything that I can't document. I don't ask you to take anything that I write on faith. I will offer opinions and I'll tell you their opinions. I'll give you my analysis. But I don't make any assertions unless I tell you where I got the information so that you can go find it for yourself. And I have taken on some very big names in four years. I won't go through the litany. I have never been sued because truth is an absolute defense against libel. Absolutely. All the time. What I'm doing tonight is I'm presenting to you exactly the same way that I would present if I were a detective talking to a district attorney or if I were an attorney talking to a grand jury. I'm presenting a case with the evidence. I will not speculate. There's no There's a lot of things we're not going to talk about tonight which can't be proven. Were there explosives in the building? Were the airplanes flown by remote control? All these cul-de-sacs that you can't go into that I can't produce proof for, I don't care. They're irrelevant. My job is to reach the people out there who haven't been reached with those facts that shake the foundation of their belief that they're the fundamentally most blessed people on the planet enjoying a standard of living because God loves America above all other peoples in the world which is what George Bush sells. I have to shake their belief in the system and you don't do that with speculation. Now there's some things that I have to tell you before we start talking about September the 11th. If you don't understand these things you will never understand completely why September the 11th happened. One is drugs and the other is oil. If you're in the U.S. government in the executive branch and somebody working under you commits a crime there is a law in Title 18 U.S. Code that says you have to turn in your employees if they're committing crimes. You have to call the Justice Department. You have to call the FBI and report the criminal activity. Well they knew that. It's a law. So they had a negotiation. In this negotiation which was between William French Smith which you can barely read down here that's Reagan's first Attorney General which you can read boy there's an oxymoron the Honorable William J. Casey Director of Central Intelligence in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures. Let me let that sink in for a minute. The Attorney General has just notified the head of the CIA that he no longer has to tell the Department of Justice when his people are dealing drugs. There it is in black and white. Proof of a conspiracy. Right there. By the way do you know who negotiated this memorandum for William French Smith? Ken Starr. Now there's one reason and one reason only why the CIA deals drugs. Not to fund covert operations. Not to make George Bush rich. But to support the U.S. economy. June 27th 1999 New York Stock Exchange Chief meets Colombian top rebel commander Bogota. A guy by the name of Dick Grasso flies to Bogota and meets with the FARC guerrillas. Now everybody knows in Colombia right everybody deals drugs right? Everybody. Left, right, center, government, paramilitaries they all deal drugs. And what Dick Grasso said when he was meeting with the FARC commander was will you please invest your drug money in Wall Street? That's what he said. It's in the story right there. He didn't say drug money but he said let us manage your funds and it's you know everybody knows the only way that FARC makes money is by taxing the cocaine trade. Black and white. Didn't hear that on Peter Jennings did you? Okay so he's asking for money to Wall Street and you know what the FARC guys told him? They said no senor. A year later President Bill Clinton announces Plan Colombia. You know and we since displaced two million people from their homes by spraying glyphosate from Monsanto and we're spraying food crops of course and we're just driving the cocaine production onto lands controlled by the paramilitaries and we're getting ready to go to war in Colombia again because there's oil there. Let's stay on the drug theme for a minute. In January of last year Senator Carl Levin of Michigan author of a minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Correspondent Banking and this is a copy of this is the first page of the report I just wanted to show you what the report looks like. If you go down at the bottom it says inattention and disinterest by U.S. banks in screening the foreign banks they take in as clients have allowed rogue foreign banks and their criminal clients to carry on money laundering and other criminal activities in the United States and yes that's true and to protect the narcotics industry and then if you read the report a little bit further it says J.P. Morgan who was by the way the largest creditor of Enron Bank of America Citigroup and First Union are laundering all this drug money it says down here one trillion trillion laundered annually. That's from the U.S. Senate and it says but I saw this back in May when Citibank Citigroup by the way who's on the board of directors at Citigroup John Deutsch the former CIA director Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs former secretary of the treasury a woman named Nora Slatkin the former CIA executive director that's the number three position they paid 12 billion dollars to buy Banco Nacional de Mexico Banamex second largest bank in Mexico it is an overt open drug money laundering bank in Mexico so overt that a brilliant Mexican newspaper named Porresto wrote a story about two years ago about the bank's owner Roberto Hernandez he owns most of the Yucatan Peninsula in fact the natives refer to it as the cocaine peninsula there's landing strips all over the place there's refueling for boats and they published all this and they're documenting that Hernandez was a major drug trafficker by the way in August of 2000 Bill Clinton vacationed for 10 days on Hernandez's property President-elect Vicente Fox the first day after winning the election paid a courtesy call on Roberto Hernandez Roberto Hernandez shared a media consultant with George W. Bush Hernandez now sits on the board of directors with Robert Rubin John Deutsch at Citigroup they don't care if you know how criminal they are anymore they are laughing at you and they hold the rest of the American people in utter contempt let's take a little look at CIA and Wall Street the National Security Act of 1947 was written by Clark Clifford an aide to Harry Truman longtime Democratic Party powerhouse he wrote the act that created the CIA who can tell me what his profession was Wall Street lawyer and banker as a matter of fact Clark Clifford is the American who brought the Bank of Credit and Commerce International BCCI onto American shores okay BCCI was a huge drug money laundering bank now the CIA was designed for Clifford by two brothers John Foster and Alan Dulles John Foster was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower Alan Dulles was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower John Foster was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower Dulles was DCI get used to the term Director of Central Intelligence DCI from 53 to 61 John Kennedy fired him after the Bay of Pigs what was their profession Wall Street lawyers from the firm Sullivan and Cromwell the most powerful law firm wouldn't we agree on that on Wall Street by the way who is who are Enron's attorneys Sullivan and Cromwell okay Bill Casey most of us are old enough to remember Iran Contra what was Bill Casey's job for Richard Nixon he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Stanley Sporkin retired recently as a US District Court judge in Washington DC CIA General Counsel in the 1980s what was his job before he was the CIA General Counsel he was General Counsel of the SEC David Daugherty who was the CIA General Counsel after Stanley Sporkin anybody know what he does now gonna love this one Executive Vice President of the New York Stock Exchange for Enforcement", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.26, "end": 5.48, "text": " I'm Bonnie Faulkner.
