{"text": " I want to start with an observation that I think is so obvious as to be virtually banal, and that is that we are presently living through a crisis of very great severity and great complexity. Yet, I think, we lack a conceptual framework with which to interpret it, let alone one that could help us resolve it in an emancipatory way. Clearly, today's crisis is multidimensional, encompassing not only economy and finance, but also ecology, society, and politics. Of these dimensions, I want to single out three as especially salient. There is first the ecological strand of crisis, reflected in the depletion of the Earth's non-renewable resources and in the progressive destruction of the biosphere, as witnessed first and foremost in global warming. There is second the financialization strand of crisis, reflected in the creation, seemingly out of thin air, of an entire shadow economy of paper values, insubstantial and yet able somehow to devastate what we call the real economy and to endanger the livelihoods of billions of people. Finally, there is the strand pertaining to social reproduction, which is reflected in the growing strain under neoliberalism on what some call care or affective labor, but what I'm going to understand more broadly as the human capacities available to create and maintain social bonds, which includes, as we'll see, the work of socializing the young, building communities, and of reproducing the shared meanings, affective dispositions, and the horizons of value that underpin social cooperation. Now, taken singly, each of these three strands of crisis is scary enough. Put them together, and you have a constellation that is truly alarming. It's the convergence of these three strands, the ecological, the financial, and the social, that constitutes, in my view, the distinctive character and the special severity of the present crisis. Under these conditions, one conclusion should be axiomatic. A critical theory for our time must encompass all three of these crisis dimensions. Certainly, it must disclose the specificity of each, but it should also clarify the ways in which the ecological strand of crisis, the financialization strand of crisis, and the social reproduction strand of crisis are intertwined. Finally, such a theory should explore the possibility that all three derive from a common source in the deep structure of our society, and that all three share a common grammar. Today, however, we lack any such critical theory. Our received understandings of crisis tend to focus on a single aspect, typically the economic or the ecological, which they isolate from and privilege over the others. For the most part, ecological theorists isolate the crisis of nature from that of finance, while most critics of political economy fail to bring that domain into relation to ecology. And neither of those camps pays much attention at all to the crisis of social reproduction, which has become the province of gender studies and feminist theory, and which therefore remains ghettoized. Today, however, this sort of critical separatism, as I'd like to call it, is counterproductive. In the present context, when crisis is patently tridimensional, at the very least, we need a broader integrated approach that connects the ecological, the economic, and the social. Eschewing economism on the one hand, and what I'd like to call ecologism on the other, we need to revive the project of large-scale social theorizing that tries to encompass all three dimensions of crisis, and to clarify the relations among them. In elucidating the nature and roots of crisis, such a perspective should also seek to reveal prospects for an emancipatory resolution. Now, I want to suggest that the thought of Karl Polanyi affords a promising starting point for this sort of theorizing. His 1944 classic, The Great Transformation, is an account of an earlier crisis that connects ecology, political economy, and social reproduction. The book conceives crisis as a multifaceted historical process that began with the rise of economic liberalism in 19th century Britain, and proceeded over the course of a century and a half to envelop the entire world, bringing with it intensified imperial subjection, periodic economic depressions, and cataclysmic wars. For Polanyi, moreover, this crisis was less about economic breakdown in the narrow sense than about disintegrated communities, destroyed livelihoods, and despoiled nature. Its roots lay less in intra-economic contradictions than in a momentous shift in the place of economy vis-a-vis society. Overturning what had been the universal relation in which markets were embedded in social institutions and subject to moral and ethical norms and to political regulation, proponents of the so-called self-regulating market, and I put this term in scare quotes because in Polanyi's view it's an oxymoron, markets cannot be self-regulating, proponents of the so-called self-regulating market sought to build a world in which society, morals, ethics, and politics were subordinated to, even modeled on, markets. Conceiving labor, land, and money as factors of production, they treated those fundamental bases of social life as if they were ordinary commodities and subjected them to market exchange. The effects of this fictitious commodification, as Polanyi called it, were so destructive of habitats, livelihoods, and communities as to spark an ongoing counter-movement for what he called the protection of society. The result was a distinctive pattern of social conflict which he called the double movement, a spiraling conflict between free marketeers on the one hand and social protectionists on the other, which led to political stalemate and ultimately to fascism and the Second World War. Well, as even this highly compressed summary suggests, here we have an account of crisis that avoids at least two forms of critical separatism. As shewing both economism and ecologism, the great transformation interweaves an account of financial breakdown and economic collapse with accounts of the despoliation of nature and the disintegration of society, all subtended by intractable political conflicts that failed to resolve, indeed exacerbated, the crisis. Refusing to limit himself either to the economic on the one hand or to the ecological on the other, Polanyi elaborated a conception of crisis that encompasses both those dimensions as well as the dimension of social reproduction. By incorporating the latter, moreover, his framework seems to me to be capable, at least in principle, of embracing many feminist concerns and indeed of connecting them to the concerns of political ecologists and political economists. Now, this point alone would qualify Polanyi as a promising resource for those of us who seek to understand the crisis of the 21st century. But there are some other more specific reasons for turning to him today. The story told in The Great Transformation has some very strong echoes in current developments. There is at least a prima facie case for the view that the present crisis was triggered by recent efforts to disencumber markets from the governance regimes, both national, international, and regional, that were established in the aftermath of World War II. What we today call neoliberalism has quite a bit in common with the very same 19th century faith in the so-called self-regulating market that unleashed the crisis Polanyi chronicled. Now, as then, attempts to implement that creed are spurring efforts to come up with a new model of modernization that will modify nature, labor, and money. Just think about the burgeoning markets in carbon emissions and biotechnology, in childcare, schooling, and the care of the old, and of course, need I add, in financial derivatives.", "segments":

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " I want to start with an observation that I think is so obvious as to be virtually banal, and that is that we are presently living through a crisis of very great severity and great complexity. Yet, I think, we lack a conceptual framework with which to interpret it, let alone one that could help us resolve it in an emancipatory way. Clearly, today's crisis is multidimensional, encompassing not only economy and finance, but also ecology, society, and politics. Of these dimensions, I want to single out three as especially salient. There is first the ecological strand of crisis, reflected in the depletion of the Earth's non-renewable resources and in the progressive destruction of the biosphere, as witnessed first and foremost in global warming. There is second the financialization strand of crisis, reflected in the creation, seemingly out of thin air, of an entire shadow economy of paper values, insubstantial and yet able somehow to devastate what we call the real economy and to endanger the livelihoods of billions of people. Finally, there is the strand pertaining to social reproduction, which is reflected in the growing strain under neoliberalism on what some call care or affective labor, but what I'm going to understand more broadly as the human capacities available to create and maintain social bonds, which includes, as we'll see, the work of socializing the young, building communities, and of reproducing the shared meanings, affective dispositions, and the horizons of value that underpin social cooperation. Now, taken singly, each of these three strands of crisis is scary enough. Put them together, and you have a constellation that is truly alarming. It's the convergence of these three strands, the ecological, the financial, and the social, that constitutes, in my view, the distinctive character and the special severity of the present crisis. Under these conditions, one conclusion should be axiomatic. A critical theory for our time must encompass all three of these crisis dimensions. Certainly, it must disclose the specificity of each, but it should also clarify the ways in which the ecological strand of crisis, the financialization strand of crisis, and the social reproduction strand of crisis are intertwined. Finally, such a theory should explore the possibility that all three derive from a common source in the deep structure of our society, and that all three share a common grammar. Today, however, we lack any such critical theory. Our received understandings of crisis tend to focus on a single aspect, typically the economic or the ecological, which they isolate from and privilege over the others. For the most part, ecological theorists isolate the crisis of nature from that of finance, while most critics of political economy fail to bring that domain into relation to ecology. And neither of those camps pays much attention at all to the crisis of social reproduction, which has become the province of gender studies and feminist theory, and which therefore remains ghettoized. Today, however, this sort of critical separatism, as I'd like to call it, is counterproductive. In the present context, when crisis is patently tridimensional, at the very least, we need a broader integrated approach that connects the ecological, the economic, and the social. Eschewing economism on the one hand, and what I'd like to call ecologism on the other, we need to revive the project of large-scale social theorizing that tries to encompass all three dimensions of crisis, and to clarify the relations among them. In elucidating the nature and roots of crisis, such a perspective should also seek to reveal prospects for an emancipatory resolution. Now, I want to suggest that the thought of Karl Polanyi affords a promising starting point for this sort of theorizing. His 1944 classic, The Great Transformation, is an account of an earlier crisis that connects ecology, political economy, and social reproduction. The book conceives crisis as a multifaceted historical process that began with the rise of economic liberalism in 19th century Britain, and proceeded over the course of a century and a half to envelop the entire world, bringing with it intensified imperial subjection, periodic economic depressions, and cataclysmic wars. For Polanyi, moreover, this crisis was less about economic breakdown in the narrow sense than about disintegrated communities, destroyed livelihoods, and despoiled nature. Its roots lay less in intra-economic contradictions than in a momentous shift in the place of economy vis-a-vis society. Overturning what had been the universal relation in which markets were embedded in social institutions and subject to moral and ethical norms and to political regulation, proponents of the so-called self-regulating market, and I put this term in scare quotes because in Polanyi's view it's an oxymoron, markets cannot be self-regulating, proponents of the so-called self-regulating market sought to build a world in which society, morals, ethics, and politics were subordinated to, even modeled on, markets. Conceiving labor, land, and money as factors of production, they treated those fundamental bases of social life as if they were ordinary commodities and subjected them to market exchange. The effects of this fictitious commodification, as Polanyi called it, were so destructive of habitats, livelihoods, and communities as to spark an ongoing counter-movement for what he called the protection of society. The result was a distinctive pattern of social conflict which he called the double movement, a spiraling conflict between free marketeers on the one hand and social protectionists on the other, which led to political stalemate and ultimately to fascism and the Second World War. Well, as even this highly compressed summary suggests, here we have an account of crisis that avoids at least two forms of critical separatism. As shewing both economism and ecologism, the great transformation interweaves an account of financial breakdown and economic collapse with accounts of the despoliation of nature and the disintegration of society, all subtended by intractable political conflicts that failed to resolve, indeed exacerbated, the crisis. Refusing to limit himself either to the economic on the one hand or to the ecological on the other, Polanyi elaborated a conception of crisis that encompasses both those dimensions as well as the dimension of social reproduction. By incorporating the latter, moreover, his framework seems to me to be capable, at least in principle, of embracing many feminist concerns and indeed of connecting them to the concerns of political ecologists and political economists. Now, this point alone would qualify Polanyi as a promising resource for those of us who seek to understand the crisis of the 21st century. But there are some other more specific reasons for turning to him today. The story told in The Great Transformation has some very strong echoes in current developments. There is at least a prima facie case for the view that the present crisis was triggered by recent efforts to disencumber markets from the governance regimes, both national, international, and regional, that were established in the aftermath of World War II. What we today call neoliberalism has quite a bit in common with the very same 19th century faith in the so-called self-regulating market that unleashed the crisis Polanyi chronicled. Now, as then, attempts to implement that creed are spurring efforts to come up with a new model of modernization that will modify nature, labor, and money. Just think about the burgeoning markets in carbon emissions and biotechnology, in childcare, schooling, and the care of the old, and of course, need I add, in financial derivatives.", "segments":
