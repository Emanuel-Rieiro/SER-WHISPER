{"text": " a couple, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, whatever. And I go, Jeannie, there's a name for it. She, like, started crying. She's like, ever since I, you know, I actually showed her a documentary years ago called My Mother's Garden. Have you ever seen that? No, I think I need to. Fascinating. Because my mom is a hoarder. Is she? Well, she's not an official hoarder like that, but there's just so much junk that I... Can you see the floor? Yeah, but the problem is, like, I remember cleaning up magazines, and I'm talking about, I'm not even talking about, like, Vanity Fair. I'm talking about, like, you know, stuff that was taken out of the doctor's office. You know, that kind of, like, no one needs those. Highlights. Yeah, highlights. There you go. And I cleaned them all up, and she was, like, irritated that I had touched them. Well, this is a great documentary for you. A woman with two brothers, and she's now in her 40s. Her mother's stunning, looking absolutely gorgeous. And she has hoarded so much that she's forced to move into the garden. So there's a little garden outside of the house. It's in Los Angeles. And the mother gets put in a mental hospital, and while she's there, the sister and two brothers decide to help the mom, and they clean out the house. And the mother comes back to the empty house and has a complete nervous breakdown. Wow. And so I had shown Jeannie that, like, years ago, but she thought it was an isolated incident. So when the show Hoarders came on, Jeannie was so overwhelmed that there was an identifiable term for what it was that she lived through, and to be able to see all of those adult children raging at the parents and screaming for, you know, the fact that they were the Tupperware container. Well, it's an illness. It's a severe illness. They can't see. You know, when you talk about, like, you can't see the forest or the trees. Like, it's a literal interpretation of that, where, like, they don't. Did you see the Maisley brothers, the Big Edie and Little Edie? It's Maisels. Maisels. Albert Maisels. Thank you. This is the second. I did that with Cynthia Nixon with Uta Hagen. I said Hagen, and she's like, it's Hagen, like Hagen does. Yeah, Albert Maisels, and he just died. Yes. Yes, and I actually rented his apartment in the Dakota. Oh, wow. Years ago from him. He had a tiny studio for writing that I rented up when I was doing Grease on Broadway and became friendly with him, and that is one of my favorite documentaries. I think it's the best documentary kind of ever made. It was the beginning of reality TV. It created a whole new genre, both in journalism, I feel like it changed the page, and absolutely in documentary films. And then they nurtured all of these younger documentary filmmakers who hopefully pronounced their names correctly. Yes, Maisels. Yeah. There you go. Did you see the musical? Grease? No. Grey Gardens? No. With Christine Ebersole. Was it fantastic? And Mary Louise Wilson, both who won the Tony Award for their performance. It was stupendous. It was almost like channeling, not even acting. And they both are singers, and, you know, there was an amazing book and a great score, and I think anything Christine Ebersole does, they should give her a Tony. I agree. Even if she just says she's going to audition, they should give her a Tony. The problem with Broadway, and we'll talk about your love for it, is that it is so... It's so expensive. All right, all right. Now listen. That I get to, I don't... Do you know how scared I was just? The problem with Broadway, it's like every single nerve gets... Yeah, you're right. I agree. It's too expensive. It makes me so sad, because I was desperate to see that, and Christine Ebersole got rave reviews. And, you know, talk about a cathartic experience for someone. I would have loved to go see it. But it's just so expensive that it's really hard to get to go see things. Yeah, it's become really elitist, and it's really sad. Even, you know, I have a school here on... I have to talk about a little bit. But we get those kids to go to see Broadway shows, and sadly, we've had to purchase all the tickets, you know? Yeah. So part of the cost of running this whole event is that these children who live in the theater district and never get to see the shows, right? It's like being in Hawaii, living near the beach and never getting to go in. Yeah. Right? So we get them to actually go see what it is that's going on in their neighborhood that they're, you know, living amongst, but never getting to experience. But we have to pay for them as well, so it's quite close to... But it's been unsustainable. Well, it's not unsustainable, because here we are, and it's thriving, and things are really going well. But the industry itself, I don't think, is set up to perpetuate its longevity. I apologize. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but what I meant by unsustainable is that if there is not a Rosie O'Donnell in place who happens to be a philanthropic, those kids don't get to go to the theater. Oh, well, that's true. I think the organization that we have built for the last 15 years, I think it is, 12, 13, is really needed, and I wish there could be more. We work with the Board of Ed, and we go into the most needy schools based on free lunch. So, you know, there is definitely a need for arts programs in New York City and across the country, and many states have asked us to replicate it. But, you know, it's specific, in my opinion, to New York, and although we took the premise and the prototype from Jacques D'Amboise's Dance America, he's an amazing dancer and choreographer who goes around the world teaching dance to, you know, people in the Appalachian Mountains, to, you know, people in other countries. We took what he did, and we replicated it, only changed it to musical theater, not just dance. I'm so glad he's teaching them, people in the Appalachian Mountains who already are desperate and needy for jobs, skills that will also not help them. But they'll be able to do a time step. Mining's over. Kickball train. Step, step, step. I want to go back and start at the beginning with your childhood, because you, sort of fell into stand-up, it seems like, but you really wanted to be on Broadway when you were young. Was Bette Midler one of the first stars you saw on Broadway? Yes, Clams on a Half Shell, 1973, I believe it was. I was 10 or 11. I know my mother had died, so it was after March 73. So you were 10 or 11, yeah. Mm-hmm. And I remember just looking at her and thinking, I want to be her. Not, I want to be like her. Not, I like wanted to do an I Dream a Genie, and blink and become Bette Midler, because I had never seen a live performer with that kind of light, electricity, and talent. I had never seen anything like it. And I, my parents had taken us to see touring companies of George M. Cohan at Westbury Music Fair as a child, Joel Grey, I believe. Oh, yeah. In Cabaret, I saw him in Cabaret. Yeah, that was amazing. But this was in, you know, George, in George M. Cohan. That was a show. Give My Regards to Broadway, I believe, was in that. But I had seen shows, but I had never seen a performer like Bette Midler. So that was the beginning. And then she had three backup singers called Harlots, right? And so in my mind, I thought, well, I'm not really a good singer, but I bet I could be one of her backup singers. And then I went to see more musicals, and then I saw, you know, more shows, and I would stand outside the stage door and watch these sweaty actors come out, and I would think, okay, this is what I definitely want to do. How do I end up getting here? And I really saw a stand-up comedian. I never would, you know, I mean, I saw them on TV. I saw Tony Fields. Yeah. My mother never. Was Tony Fields on TV? Tony Fields, yeah. Did they have televisions back then? Yes, Ed Sullivan. I'm 53, so I remember Black and White and Ed Sullivan, and I remember watching Tony Fields and Phyllis Diller. And my mom did not like Joan Rivers. Yes, because she was too abrasive? She was mean to Elizabeth Taylor. Oh, forget it. Which was a very big crime in my family. Yes, I'm sure. And so she never really liked her, and I remember her always telling me, if you have to be mean and hurt someone else, you're not really funny. And so I was like, wow, that's interesting. So, you know, it took until I was... Do you feel that way, too? You know, I think that Joan did so much for comedy and for women, but she is a reflection of the time she grew up in. So, you know, her act... And herself. Exactly. You know, self-debasing and, you know, I'm so ugly, I'm so fat. Right, and I don't think in today's kind of pop culture lexicon, there's real... Even Kathy Griffin, she doesn't make fun of herself. You know, she kind of puts down other people or makes, you know, political observations about societal setups. Right. But I don't know that she tries to eviscerate people the way Joan Rivers did. Yes. But even when you were talking about, you know, when I said, like, how did you possibly win homecoming, you know, queen, class president, class clown, and all these things, you deflected and said, oh, it's because I was so eager to please. But you were completely deflecting away from the fact that could it be that you were super talented and that's why? Well, I would say this. I'm super accessible. I was friendly to all the groups. So I paid just as much attention to the janitor as I did to the principal, as I did to the nerdy kid, as I did to the jock. Right? So I was an equal opportunity. Like, I feel like most people in the world have an E-ZPass that can get them in to me. Right? And there's so many different E-ZPasses that give them access. So when I walk down the street or when I go to a restaurant, people will come over and say hello to me and feel an intimacy with me. That makes me sometimes question whether or not I've met them before. Right? Normally I go through, okay, try to see if I actually know this person. Is this menopause fame? Right. Or Facebook. Exactly. But then they will tell me what the connection is. So people will say, my mother died when I was a kid, too. I also have a child with a learning disability. I also had a heart attack. I lost weight, too. I'm a gay person. I'm, you know, there are so many. I have eyebrows. Well, that's my point is there are so many ways, and I'm so sort of open about", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 2.22, "text": " a couple, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, whatever.", "seek":

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " a couple, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, whatever. And I go, Jeannie, there's a name for it. She, like, started crying. She's like, ever since I, you know, I actually showed her a documentary years ago called My Mother's Garden. Have you ever seen that? No, I think I need to. Fascinating. Because my mom is a hoarder. Is she? Well, she's not an official hoarder like that, but there's just so much junk that I... Can you see the floor? Yeah, but the problem is, like, I remember cleaning up magazines, and I'm talking about, I'm not even talking about, like, Vanity Fair. I'm talking about, like, you know, stuff that was taken out of the doctor's office. You know, that kind of, like, no one needs those. Highlights. Yeah, highlights. There you go. And I cleaned them all up, and she was, like, irritated that I had touched them. Well, this is a great documentary for you. A woman with two brothers, and she's now in her 40s. Her mother's stunning, looking absolutely gorgeous. And she has hoarded so much that she's forced to move into the garden. So there's a little garden outside of the house. It's in Los Angeles. And the mother gets put in a mental hospital, and while she's there, the sister and two brothers decide to help the mom, and they clean out the house. And the mother comes back to the empty house and has a complete nervous breakdown. Wow. And so I had shown Jeannie that, like, years ago, but she thought it was an isolated incident. So when the show Hoarders came on, Jeannie was so overwhelmed that there was an identifiable term for what it was that she lived through, and to be able to see all of those adult children raging at the parents and screaming for, you know, the fact that they were the Tupperware container. Well, it's an illness. It's a severe illness. They can't see. You know, when you talk about, like, you can't see the forest or the trees. Like, it's a literal interpretation of that, where, like, they don't. Did you see the Maisley brothers, the Big Edie and Little Edie? It's Maisels. Maisels. Albert Maisels. Thank you. This is the second. I did that with Cynthia Nixon with Uta Hagen. I said Hagen, and she's like, it's Hagen, like Hagen does. Yeah, Albert Maisels, and he just died. Yes. Yes, and I actually rented his apartment in the Dakota. Oh, wow. Years ago from him. He had a tiny studio for writing that I rented up when I was doing Grease on Broadway and became friendly with him, and that is one of my favorite documentaries. I think it's the best documentary kind of ever made. It was the beginning of reality TV. It created a whole new genre, both in journalism, I feel like it changed the page, and absolutely in documentary films. And then they nurtured all of these younger documentary filmmakers who hopefully pronounced their names correctly. Yes, Maisels. Yeah. There you go. Did you see the musical? Grease? No. Grey Gardens? No. With Christine Ebersole. Was it fantastic? And Mary Louise Wilson, both who won the Tony Award for their performance. It was stupendous. It was almost like channeling, not even acting. And they both are singers, and, you know, there was an amazing book and a great score, and I think anything Christine Ebersole does, they should give her a Tony. I agree. Even if she just says she's going to audition, they should give her a Tony. The problem with Broadway, and we'll talk about your love for it, is that it is so... It's so expensive. All right, all right. Now listen. That I get to, I don't... Do you know how scared I was just? The problem with Broadway, it's like every single nerve gets... Yeah, you're right. I agree. It's too expensive. It makes me so sad, because I was desperate to see that, and Christine Ebersole got rave reviews. And, you know, talk about a cathartic experience for someone. I would have loved to go see it. But it's just so expensive that it's really hard to get to go see things. Yeah, it's become really elitist, and it's really sad. Even, you know, I have a school here on... I have to talk about a little bit. But we get those kids to go to see Broadway shows, and sadly, we've had to purchase all the tickets, you know? Yeah. So part of the cost of running this whole event is that these children who live in the theater district and never get to see the shows, right? It's like being in Hawaii, living near the beach and never getting to go in. Yeah. Right? So we get them to actually go see what it is that's going on in their neighborhood that they're, you know, living amongst, but never getting to experience. But we have to pay for them as well, so it's quite close to... But it's been unsustainable. Well, it's not unsustainable, because here we are, and it's thriving, and things are really going well. But the industry itself, I don't think, is set up to perpetuate its longevity. I apologize. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but what I meant by unsustainable is that if there is not a Rosie O'Donnell in place who happens to be a philanthropic, those kids don't get to go to the theater. Oh, well, that's true. I think the organization that we have built for the last 15 years, I think it is, 12, 13, is really needed, and I wish there could be more. We work with the Board of Ed, and we go into the most needy schools based on free lunch. So, you know, there is definitely a need for arts programs in New York City and across the country, and many states have asked us to replicate it. But, you know, it's specific, in my opinion, to New York, and although we took the premise and the prototype from Jacques D'Amboise's Dance America, he's an amazing dancer and choreographer who goes around the world teaching dance to, you know, people in the Appalachian Mountains, to, you know, people in other countries. We took what he did, and we replicated it, only changed it to musical theater, not just dance. I'm so glad he's teaching them, people in the Appalachian Mountains who already are desperate and needy for jobs, skills that will also not help them. But they'll be able to do a time step. Mining's over. Kickball train. Step, step, step. I want to go back and start at the beginning with your childhood, because you, sort of fell into stand-up, it seems like, but you really wanted to be on Broadway when you were young. Was Bette Midler one of the first stars you saw on Broadway? Yes, Clams on a Half Shell, 1973, I believe it was. I was 10 or 11. I know my mother had died, so it was after March 73. So you were 10 or 11, yeah. Mm-hmm. And I remember just looking at her and thinking, I want to be her. Not, I want to be like her. Not, I like wanted to do an I Dream a Genie, and blink and become Bette Midler, because I had never seen a live performer with that kind of light, electricity, and talent. I had never seen anything like it. And I, my parents had taken us to see touring companies of George M. Cohan at Westbury Music Fair as a child, Joel Grey, I believe. Oh, yeah. In Cabaret, I saw him in Cabaret. Yeah, that was amazing. But this was in, you know, George, in George M. Cohan. That was a show. Give My Regards to Broadway, I believe, was in that. But I had seen shows, but I had never seen a performer like Bette Midler. So that was the beginning. And then she had three backup singers called Harlots, right? And so in my mind, I thought, well, I'm not really a good singer, but I bet I could be one of her backup singers. And then I went to see more musicals, and then I saw, you know, more shows, and I would stand outside the stage door and watch these sweaty actors come out, and I would think, okay, this is what I definitely want to do. How do I end up getting here? And I really saw a stand-up comedian. I never would, you know, I mean, I saw them on TV. I saw Tony Fields. Yeah. My mother never. Was Tony Fields on TV? Tony Fields, yeah. Did they have televisions back then? Yes, Ed Sullivan. I'm 53, so I remember Black and White and Ed Sullivan, and I remember watching Tony Fields and Phyllis Diller. And my mom did not like Joan Rivers. Yes, because she was too abrasive? She was mean to Elizabeth Taylor. Oh, forget it. Which was a very big crime in my family. Yes, I'm sure. And so she never really liked her, and I remember her always telling me, if you have to be mean and hurt someone else, you're not really funny. And so I was like, wow, that's interesting. So, you know, it took until I was... Do you feel that way, too? You know, I think that Joan did so much for comedy and for women, but she is a reflection of the time she grew up in. So, you know, her act... And herself. Exactly. You know, self-debasing and, you know, I'm so ugly, I'm so fat. Right, and I don't think in today's kind of pop culture lexicon, there's real... Even Kathy Griffin, she doesn't make fun of herself. You know, she kind of puts down other people or makes, you know, political observations about societal setups. Right. But I don't know that she tries to eviscerate people the way Joan Rivers did. Yes. But even when you were talking about, you know, when I said, like, how did you possibly win homecoming, you know, queen, class president, class clown, and all these things, you deflected and said, oh, it's because I was so eager to please. But you were completely deflecting away from the fact that could it be that you were super talented and that's why? Well, I would say this. I'm super accessible. I was friendly to all the groups. So I paid just as much attention to the janitor as I did to the principal, as I did to the nerdy kid, as I did to the jock. Right? So I was an equal opportunity. Like, I feel like most people in the world have an E-ZPass that can get them in to me. Right? And there's so many different E-ZPasses that give them access. So when I walk down the street or when I go to a restaurant, people will come over and say hello to me and feel an intimacy with me. That makes me sometimes question whether or not I've met them before. Right? Normally I go through, okay, try to see if I actually know this person. Is this menopause fame? Right. Or Facebook. Exactly. But then they will tell me what the connection is. So people will say, my mother died when I was a kid, too. I also have a child with a learning disability. I also had a heart attack. I lost weight, too. I'm a gay person. I'm, you know, there are so many. I have eyebrows. Well, that's my point is there are so many ways, and I'm so sort of open about", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 2.22, "text": " a couple, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, whatever.",
