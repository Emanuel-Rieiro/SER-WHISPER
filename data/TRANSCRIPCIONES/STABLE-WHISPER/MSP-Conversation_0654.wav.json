{"text": " Because I really think it's fundamentally unfair in general. And I just would love to see that people can retire with dignity. Have a retirement. Not have to worry about where you're, if you get sick, when you get sick. That you have to pay a bill or go bankrupt for committing the sin of being a human being. Getting sick. Not having enough money to pay for your cancer. I mean, how disgusting is that? How unpatriotic is that? So they're talking about this day of patriotism that he signs. Whatever, I'm trying to find out what the, uh, patriot, I'm just Googling it. Patriot. Because it was, it was trending for a little while on Twitter. And I was like, you must be kidding me. But, because they're not patriots. Republicans are not patriots. Let's get this straight. It is not patriotic to take a, just take the decent life, the decent middle class life away from people. They're, to take health care for people. Of all things. You're going to take health care? That's your mission. That's Paul Ryan's mission. That's what, that's what these Republicans, when they're talking about making America great, what are they talking about? Now, you're, when, he's putting into his cabinet these people that got rich. Now, you know, FDR had his brain trust, right? He had the, when they, when he was handed another husking ruin from another Republican president, the first Republican Great Depression, he put together a brain trust of, well, became known as the brain trust. People, economists, they, these weren't business people. These were philosophers, economists, you know, people who, academics. They were studying the, the world. And they were building the society. That's what they're, they were tasked with, building a society from the ground up. And so, I, when Trump gets up there and says, oh, we have the great, great IQs, our, all our cabinet, we have all the, we have the highest IQs. First of all, that's just a flat out lie. Well, not just, first of all, it's like everything he says is a lie. So, they're, they're not, who is he surrounding himself with? Because in his mind, you're only worthy if you're, if you're rich. So, forget you scientists. All the people that they praise, though, all the, well, the, the, the, uh, cops, the, the military, you're just, they stroke people like that. They stroke the egos of people like that because they need you. Like the Praetorian Guard. Like the, because they need you to go cracking skulls on the people who get out into the streets. They want you to, to maintain fascism. That's why it's really disappointing to see the, at the inauguration, that there were some people breaking windows. I don't, I mean, honestly, I have to tell you that that's, to me, sounds a lot like agent provocateurs. I don't, people, you know that there's been a few instances recently of right-wingers being caught trying to pay people to incite violence at the inauguration. So, whatever. I don't know. All I know is the people that I know, nobody, we're not out there breaking windows, but we're not, uh, afraid to lay down in the streets and bring this thing to a halt. Because the only thing that's going to work against this deplorable monstrosity is non-violent, peaceful, uh, civil disobedience. That's, it's, and it has to be non-violent. We cannot, stand up against the machine. That's, this is how you turn people off. In fact, there's, if you, there's a book, actually, from, uh, Dictatorship to Democracy, I think it's called. There's, uh, where they studied the, the, how different societies became democratic. And one of it is, one is that you have to get the law enforcement people on your side. And you don't do that by, um, creating violence. So, the only way you do that is really by just standing your ground and not, not, you can't fight fire with fire with this because they just, they just have the fire. They have all the fire. You have to just be peaceful. And what happens, ultimately, there's a, there's a change in the mindset where people, where the law enforcement, they're just human beings. They, and they get to a point where they refuse to, they, they refuse their orders. That's what happens. They refuse to fire on the peaceful demonstrators. They refuse to, to act on, in, in, uh, you know, as the, uh, high-class musclemen for big business. That's what happens. So, because these are our, the, our relatives. People, you know, we're, we're all in this together. They're the, that's why when Republicans go after, you know, unions, they never go after the police union because they need them. They know, they need them to crack skulls. They need them to keep democracy from truly breaking out. So. And Tara, if you, if you don't mind for a moment, um, I just want to add, um, about what you were saying with the police and how they need them. Um, recently at Standing Rock, there was a, a protest that happened. I don't know if you heard about it. It was pretty big this past week. Uh-huh. And, um, Lou, uh, Hastings of Red Red Radio Show on FYI Nation and I were covering it when it was happening live. And the following day, we found out that some of the police on the line ended up praying with the water protectors. Right. Well, that's how you do it. Water protectors actually got them to pray because they were nonviolent. And that goes exactly to what you were saying. You were talking about. Well, that's, it's not just me, but this is that if you, people who have studied how, uh, authoritarian societies or fascist societies or how the people end up implementing democracy or taking over, you know, a republic or whatever, that, that is one of the steps. It has to be, and it has to be nonviolent. That's how, uh, and you could stand up to an entire military, military machine with the power of nonviolence. And that's what Martin Luther King was about. Now, if, if breaking windows worked, I'd be like, let's go break some windows. I don't think it worked. It doesn't work. It's not that I don't think it does not work. It actually is something that is detrimental to the cause. And this, this is why I get suspicious when I see things. I know that there are some anarchists, they're young people. They don't really, I don't, they're not on our side. These are people that just want to break windows. They're not, they don't represent us. They're not in the movement. They're not in the Bernie, uh, our revolution. They're not doing things. They're not showing up and working with it within the system and, and working within the system does me. It doesn't mean that you're not inconveniencing people. This is what we're going to have to do is go to the offices of our representatives, especially in the red States. If you live in a red state, this, you're really gonna have to, you're on the front lines there. So we, if you're a liberal in a red state and you're politically engaged and involved, we, you are, are, we need you more than ever. You're going to be the people, um, showing up at the, at your Republican representatives office. They don't care as, as far as, they, um, there's that document that was written by the, the staffers, the congressional staffers about how to fight Trump in this fascist age. And one of the, then it was written, don't taking the, what the tea party had done. And one of the things that they said is don't, is that they, that the, that the representatives don't care if you're not, what you have to say, if you're not their constituent. So if I called Paul Ryan's office, they don't really care what, if I'm pissed off, they want people from Wisconsin, people in his district that has the most power. And just, he has to be hounded to the ends of the earth, him, all of them, every time they show up anywhere they go, they have to be met with resistance, met with uncomfortability. That's what I think with, I, you know, people were saying on that plane or whatever, is that, oh, they should have left her alone, leave her alone. No, I don't, I don't think that, uh, I, I don't think that there should be safe spaces in fascism. Oh, Mike Pence, he needs it. Let him go watch a play. No, no, there's no, we don't get to, uh, you know, dance for the King and his, and his cabinet could dance for all his Lords and show, shut up. No, this is what the, the, the kind of America that they're trying to create is hostile to the majority of people who live here. We're not the, the, we're not all straight white men. So if you lump us all together, they're the minority. And in fact, they didn't even win. So let's get that straight too. He did not win. Now you count Hillary got 3 million more votes. On top of it. And you're talking about people that a lot of people were disenfranchised. They were kicked off the voter rolls. This is, that's what Republicans do. They don't like democracy. They don't want it. They want power. They don't care. That's why when they get in power, they rig it. So you can't rest it from the goddamn greed centered fingers. And when, by the time they let go of it, it has goddamn claw marks on it. So they, they, I mean, who the hell would respect democracy, respect America and behave like that. So you get into power and you, that's your primary purpose is to stay, keep it. It's not about you. They're not getting into a office for altruism. In fact, just like they, their, their hero and ran said altruism is immoral. So they're getting into government. To rig the game. It's like if, if I, I don't know, I'm trying to think of a metaphor. Like if I took over some corporation just to turn it into a nonprofit, like if I infiltrated Aetna to make it a, the public option, that's what they're trying to do. They, and these, this is what I'm saying. These people, they're not that smart. They, they don't have original ideas because their idea is as old as recorded history. It's make the rich richer. They're, they have one idea. So when Twitler comes out here saying he's got an infrastructure plan and it's just another tax break to the 1%, that's their idea. Give more to the rich and it will trickle down. And that whole thing with trickle down is pretty offensive in general. How much do you hate yourself? Republicans that you, that that's the best you can do. I mean, let's talk about the average freak show, Joe Republicans, these average dupes that are out there that then there weren't that many at the inauguration. I mean, the crowds were pretty sparse in comparison. So they're, but they're out there that waving their stupid hats, yelling. We love you, Donald. Are you kidding me? How much do you hate yourself to think like, Oh, all I deserve in this, this world is a trickle. I want to be trickled upon. It's not even, it's not just, it's not a, it's not even a splash. It's not even, it's not a wave or a deluge. What, how do you say that? Deluge? I can't talk. You got it right, Tara. Well, people who listen to the show now, I can't talk. So they better, they, they, they love me anyway, whatever. They, they put up with my accent and my stupid way of speaking. And I apologize. But it is what it is. I grew up in New York and I don't know. It's just the way I talk. I'm sorry, people. But they, they, to talk about patriots and what are the, what are the, all right, here we go again, right? Because I'm baffled. I'm still baffled. I'm waiting for an answer. What do they love about America? They're patriotic. That's how is it patriotic to wake up in the morning and say, I'm going to take healthcare from millions of people that I'm going to do. Drag us back. We're finally to a point where we're moving in the right direction. That people have access to healthcare as a right. Oh my, you know, that the insurance companies can't deny you for being sick. The, it's not just the things that they, that they lie. Oh, they like, oh, that you can't be denied for preexisting conditions. And they like children on the parents plan because they could see that working in their lives.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 3.54, "text": " Because I really think it's fundamentally unfair in

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " Because I really think it's fundamentally unfair in general. And I just would love to see that people can retire with dignity. Have a retirement. Not have to worry about where you're, if you get sick, when you get sick. That you have to pay a bill or go bankrupt for committing the sin of being a human being. Getting sick. Not having enough money to pay for your cancer. I mean, how disgusting is that? How unpatriotic is that? So they're talking about this day of patriotism that he signs. Whatever, I'm trying to find out what the, uh, patriot, I'm just Googling it. Patriot. Because it was, it was trending for a little while on Twitter. And I was like, you must be kidding me. But, because they're not patriots. Republicans are not patriots. Let's get this straight. It is not patriotic to take a, just take the decent life, the decent middle class life away from people. They're, to take health care for people. Of all things. You're going to take health care? That's your mission. That's Paul Ryan's mission. That's what, that's what these Republicans, when they're talking about making America great, what are they talking about? Now, you're, when, he's putting into his cabinet these people that got rich. Now, you know, FDR had his brain trust, right? He had the, when they, when he was handed another husking ruin from another Republican president, the first Republican Great Depression, he put together a brain trust of, well, became known as the brain trust. People, economists, they, these weren't business people. These were philosophers, economists, you know, people who, academics. They were studying the, the world. And they were building the society. That's what they're, they were tasked with, building a society from the ground up. And so, I, when Trump gets up there and says, oh, we have the great, great IQs, our, all our cabinet, we have all the, we have the highest IQs. First of all, that's just a flat out lie. Well, not just, first of all, it's like everything he says is a lie. So, they're, they're not, who is he surrounding himself with? Because in his mind, you're only worthy if you're, if you're rich. So, forget you scientists. All the people that they praise, though, all the, well, the, the, the, uh, cops, the, the military, you're just, they stroke people like that. They stroke the egos of people like that because they need you. Like the Praetorian Guard. Like the, because they need you to go cracking skulls on the people who get out into the streets. They want you to, to maintain fascism. That's why it's really disappointing to see the, at the inauguration, that there were some people breaking windows. I don't, I mean, honestly, I have to tell you that that's, to me, sounds a lot like agent provocateurs. I don't, people, you know that there's been a few instances recently of right-wingers being caught trying to pay people to incite violence at the inauguration. So, whatever. I don't know. All I know is the people that I know, nobody, we're not out there breaking windows, but we're not, uh, afraid to lay down in the streets and bring this thing to a halt. Because the only thing that's going to work against this deplorable monstrosity is non-violent, peaceful, uh, civil disobedience. That's, it's, and it has to be non-violent. We cannot, stand up against the machine. That's, this is how you turn people off. In fact, there's, if you, there's a book, actually, from, uh, Dictatorship to Democracy, I think it's called. There's, uh, where they studied the, the, how different societies became democratic. And one of it is, one is that you have to get the law enforcement people on your side. And you don't do that by, um, creating violence. So, the only way you do that is really by just standing your ground and not, not, you can't fight fire with fire with this because they just, they just have the fire. They have all the fire. You have to just be peaceful. And what happens, ultimately, there's a, there's a change in the mindset where people, where the law enforcement, they're just human beings. They, and they get to a point where they refuse to, they, they refuse their orders. That's what happens. They refuse to fire on the peaceful demonstrators. They refuse to, to act on, in, in, uh, you know, as the, uh, high-class musclemen for big business. That's what happens. So, because these are our, the, our relatives. People, you know, we're, we're all in this together. They're the, that's why when Republicans go after, you know, unions, they never go after the police union because they need them. They know, they need them to crack skulls. They need them to keep democracy from truly breaking out. So. And Tara, if you, if you don't mind for a moment, um, I just want to add, um, about what you were saying with the police and how they need them. Um, recently at Standing Rock, there was a, a protest that happened. I don't know if you heard about it. It was pretty big this past week. Uh-huh. And, um, Lou, uh, Hastings of Red Red Radio Show on FYI Nation and I were covering it when it was happening live. And the following day, we found out that some of the police on the line ended up praying with the water protectors. Right. Well, that's how you do it. Water protectors actually got them to pray because they were nonviolent. And that goes exactly to what you were saying. You were talking about. Well, that's, it's not just me, but this is that if you, people who have studied how, uh, authoritarian societies or fascist societies or how the people end up implementing democracy or taking over, you know, a republic or whatever, that, that is one of the steps. It has to be, and it has to be nonviolent. That's how, uh, and you could stand up to an entire military, military machine with the power of nonviolence. And that's what Martin Luther King was about. Now, if, if breaking windows worked, I'd be like, let's go break some windows. I don't think it worked. It doesn't work. It's not that I don't think it does not work. It actually is something that is detrimental to the cause. And this, this is why I get suspicious when I see things. I know that there are some anarchists, they're young people. They don't really, I don't, they're not on our side. These are people that just want to break windows. They're not, they don't represent us. They're not in the movement. They're not in the Bernie, uh, our revolution. They're not doing things. They're not showing up and working with it within the system and, and working within the system does me. It doesn't mean that you're not inconveniencing people. This is what we're going to have to do is go to the offices of our representatives, especially in the red States. If you live in a red state, this, you're really gonna have to, you're on the front lines there. So we, if you're a liberal in a red state and you're politically engaged and involved, we, you are, are, we need you more than ever. You're going to be the people, um, showing up at the, at your Republican representatives office. They don't care as, as far as, they, um, there's that document that was written by the, the staffers, the congressional staffers about how to fight Trump in this fascist age. And one of the, then it was written, don't taking the, what the tea party had done. And one of the things that they said is don't, is that they, that the, that the representatives don't care if you're not, what you have to say, if you're not their constituent. So if I called Paul Ryan's office, they don't really care what, if I'm pissed off, they want people from Wisconsin, people in his district that has the most power. And just, he has to be hounded to the ends of the earth, him, all of them, every time they show up anywhere they go, they have to be met with resistance, met with uncomfortability. That's what I think with, I, you know, people were saying on that plane or whatever, is that, oh, they should have left her alone, leave her alone. No, I don't, I don't think that, uh, I, I don't think that there should be safe spaces in fascism. Oh, Mike Pence, he needs it. Let him go watch a play. No, no, there's no, we don't get to, uh, you know, dance for the King and his, and his cabinet could dance for all his Lords and show, shut up. No, this is what the, the, the kind of America that they're trying to create is hostile to the majority of people who live here. We're not the, the, we're not all straight white men. So if you lump us all together, they're the minority. And in fact, they didn't even win. So let's get that straight too. He did not win. Now you count Hillary got 3 million more votes. On top of it. And you're talking about people that a lot of people were disenfranchised. They were kicked off the voter rolls. This is, that's what Republicans do. They don't like democracy. They don't want it. They want power. They don't care. That's why when they get in power, they rig it. So you can't rest it from the goddamn greed centered fingers. And when, by the time they let go of it, it has goddamn claw marks on it. So they, they, I mean, who the hell would respect democracy, respect America and behave like that. So you get into power and you, that's your primary purpose is to stay, keep it. It's not about you. They're not getting into a office for altruism. In fact, just like they, their, their hero and ran said altruism is immoral. So they're getting into government. To rig the game. It's like if, if I, I don't know, I'm trying to think of a metaphor. Like if I took over some corporation just to turn it into a nonprofit, like if I infiltrated Aetna to make it a, the public option, that's what they're trying to do. They, and these, this is what I'm saying. These people, they're not that smart. They, they don't have original ideas because their idea is as old as recorded history. It's make the rich richer. They're, they have one idea. So when Twitler comes out here saying he's got an infrastructure plan and it's just another tax break to the 1%, that's their idea. Give more to the rich and it will trickle down. And that whole thing with trickle down is pretty offensive in general. How much do you hate yourself? Republicans that you, that that's the best you can do. I mean, let's talk about the average freak show, Joe Republicans, these average dupes that are out there that then there weren't that many at the inauguration. I mean, the crowds were pretty sparse in comparison. So they're, but they're out there that waving their stupid hats, yelling. We love you, Donald. Are you kidding me? How much do you hate yourself to think like, Oh, all I deserve in this, this world is a trickle. I want to be trickled upon. It's not even, it's not just, it's not a, it's not even a splash. It's not even, it's not a wave or a deluge. What, how do you say that? Deluge? I can't talk. You got it right, Tara. Well, people who listen to the show now, I can't talk. So they better, they, they, they love me anyway, whatever. They, they put up with my accent and my stupid way of speaking. And I apologize. But it is what it is. I grew up in New York and I don't know. It's just the way I talk. I'm sorry, people. But they, they, to talk about patriots and what are the, what are the, all right, here we go again, right?
