{"text": " the larger point is that men and women have proven to be different in many ways. And so the most beneficial thing that we could do is to nurture our nature instead of problematizing different aspects of our various, not various, of our two genders. So for example, it happens on the other side too, a woman's ability to, or lack of ability to be more aggressive when it comes to, for example, trying to get a raise or even in the way we talk, then there's been studies that show that women use sorry a lot more, women use but a lot more, women sort of, I forget the exact name for it, but basically when you're talking and you're making a point, but then you kind of undermine yourself, like saying, I know this might be a stupid idea, but that sort of thing, that women tended to do that a lot more. And so instead of saying, instead of people in power or even as a community and society saying, well, how can we better hear women's voices? How can we not hear that automatically comparing it to men and think of it as weakness? How can we, as Carol Killigan put it, in a different voice, how can we hear that different voice and be just as, just as, what's the word I want to say? Sort of just as responsive, just as responsive to it as we would be for a man. So if we know, if studies have shown, our experience shows for this example, that women tend to say, I'm sorry, not because they're just so apologetic, but, or it could be, but they just tend to say sorry, almost in order to soften the blow because they don't want to be aggressive. Again, pointing to that, wanting to always keep relationships intact. So making sure that they're not hurting anyone's feelings. And so saying they're sorry is not because they are necessarily sorry, but that they want you to understand that even if they disagree with you, or even because they're asking for X, Y, and Z, doesn't mean that they want to hurt you in any way. So why can't we hear that voice instead of telling women, go out there and be more aggressive, tell the people in power, tell ourselves, the society, okay, let's acknowledge that this is the way that women talk and let's allow them to talk that way and really hear them as women instead of hearing them as weak versions of men. So this happens on both sides of constantly problematizing distinct features of each gender and making us, I don't know, sort of just picking and choosing what we like most about each gender and trying to create this new sort of genderless society where everyone is upheld by the same standards. And I think I already mentioned that that is actually one of the goals of radical feminism. And radical feminism, going by the textbook definition, believes that sexism is deeply rooted in society and therefore in order to get rid of sexism, we have to get rid of gender. We have to become a genderless society. And you see a lot of radical feminism in that textbook definition throughout our society. I mean, going so far as to try and promote using pronouns like zur instead of her or him. And why do I find that problematic is that basis go beyond just gender. So it's true that some of the stereotypes that we've made up about gender or some of the the expectations that we have of different genders are just nonsense. It's completely true. Blue is for boys and pink is for girls. It's nonsense. And in fact, if you go far enough, I'm not sure exactly when it was, I think it was either Vox or like BuzzFeed did a video about this, that if you The blue was for girls. And so, yeah, the blue is for girls. And so, yeah, some things are silly. But other things are very closely related to our biology. So I can't, it's not fair for women to judge men as aggressive for just being men. Now, a man in the male group, in the male group, then men can judge if a man is too aggressive because they have a different, they can recognize what is simply strength and competition and what is aggression and someone going too far. But as women, we can't recognize that. Just as women, we can recognize someone being kind and relational and not being weak. Whereas a man may see a woman showcasing certain characteristics and think of that as weak. Whereas if he just knew better, if he understood women better, he would realize that was not what was going on. So that's a part of the issue that there are some things that are better judged within a particular gender and that we can't as easily judge as outsiders. Now, I don't believe that like men are from Mars, women are from Venus. You know, obviously no one takes that literally. I don't think that there are just so many dramatic differences between men and women that we can never understand each other. But I do think that there are some aspects that we understand about each other or that we understand better inside our group than we can ever understand about the outside group. So I spoke about chivalry in this post and the way that it's been lost because it was attacked, really. And it's not even just to say it was attacked in the past. It's still being attacked. There were still articles, I think, written as early or let's see, as far back. I'm missing a word here. But there were articles as recently as I think 2012, 13 that I was still seeing as just completely bashing chivalry. And even one article that I came across that was promoting chivalry in the comment section. Some people are bashing chivalry. And one of the reasons that people bash chivalry, especially people coming from the feminist, radical feminist framework, knowingly or unknowingly, is that it points to gender differences. And some of the things about chivalry point to the fact or rather stand as a representation that men are stronger than women and women are weaker than men. And this is part of the reason that some women have an issue with it. But the interesting thing to me and why I went through all of this about gender differences is that there are, in fact, differences between men and women, especially when you talk about physically, biologically, and yes, even some hardwired personality traits that you find more often in one than in the other. So men have a superior physical strength. If it's about physical strength, if it's about competition, whatever we're talking about, men are going to win. And that is why, and it saddens me, it saddens me a lot. But then the more I study these things, the more I understand that it's not just men who have changed. There have been active voices in the feminist community that have told men that this traditional chivalry is bad and that a lot of men have taken that, have listened to that and have followed suit. So sometimes when I go on a train, and I see mostly men sitting down and women standing up, it really saddens me because chivalry is to acknowledge, if we want to put it in liberal terms, it's for men to acknowledge their privilege. And liberals are always talking about people acknowledging their privilege. White people need to acknowledge their privilege. Cis people, which is basically cis people in their fancy academic terms, who are born in the gender that corresponds to their physical body. They want cis people to acknowledge their privilege. They want white people to acknowledge their privilege. They want men to acknowledge their privilege. Well, chivalry was men acknowledging their privilege and doing something about it. So chivalry is a man acknowledging, I am more powerful than you. And with that power, I'm going to use it in your service instead of using it against you. If it comes to seats on a train, if it comes to who's going to get to sit down, if it's about competition and physical strength, men are going to sit down because they have superior strength. They are more competitive. But if men recognize that physical strength and that competition and that competitiveness and they say, I recognize that, I recognize my privilege in liberal terms, and I'm going to use it, but in the service of women, when I see a woman on the train, coming onto the train, I'm going to get up and give her this seat because I have more stamina, because I have more physical strength, because I have a greater leaning towards competitiveness. I have everything that could beat her to that seat, whether it's we're both walking in the train and there's one seat and it could be me, you know, the guy or the girl, the seat already, and he chooses to give it up for her, then he is recognizing that privilege and he's giving it over to her. It's like, if we want to use a more familiar example in our times, it's like if a white person sees a black person being pulled over by the cops and they stop and stay in that area and on look as everything goes down because they know as a white person, privilege of very oftentimes being respected by the police more than black people. If they recognize that and they use that privilege in the service of black people, isn't that a good thing? So why is it that when men recognize their privilege and they use it in the service of women, they were attacked? Like it doesn't, it doesn't quite add up. And I think what's funny to me is that feminists, they have the biggest voices, they're the loudest in the room. And sometimes a lot of women have to suffer because of them. So to have, and I think it's also the level of anger as well. I think that men in general do not like female anger, like they don't want to deal with it. They would rather run away than have to deal with an angry woman. That's, Allah Allah, that's sort of my perception. So I think that because of the anger and because of those feminist women being the loudest voices, that a lot of men have actually become afraid of being chivalrous because they don't want that anger. They don't want to open a door for someone and they just, and the woman rolls her eyes or the woman says, I don't need you to hold the door for me or whatever else. They don't want that bad interaction. So then they just stifle themselves and, and don't use that, um, those chivalrous gestures. And I think it's really unfortunate because here we had an entire code of honor in chivalry. And I don't know why when we talk about chivalry, a lot of the times people want to go back to the days of the knights and the chivalrous code of honor. Yes, it has roots there, but chivalry is known all over the world. Any society that acknowledges gender differences, there will be chivalry. Either that or the women will be oppressed because it's one or the other. They can recognize their privilege and use it in service of women, or they choose to not recognize their privilege or they recognize it and they just don't use it in service to women. And this is what I spoke about in the article that our experience as women of what we're calling now toxic masculinity is really men being men. It's men being themselves and not filtering themselves to women because we told them not to because we as women kept telling them we're equal, treat us equally, treat us equally. And so when men treat us equally, we're like, whoa, we don't, we don't like this. This is toxic. And, um, there was already a solution in place for that. And it's not that I condone, um, something like, let's see, something like quote unquote, what they call it. A locker room talk. I certainly don't condone that. I certainly don't think that men should ever speak, um, sexually about women, uh, both ways, men or women. It's just inappropriate in general. It's not modest. But at least before there was a point where if a woman walked into the room, then the men would all just keep quiet because they knew that it was inappropriate, immodest to do that in front of a woman. Whereas now a lot of men may just keep talking. And this was chivalry towards very often, not just women, but women, children, and older people. But now men will just keep talking unless women, there's this one incident that happened when I was back home in New York. And there were some people in front of our apartment, some young men, and they were talking about all their nonsense about women talking, talking, talking. And they're, they're in an apartment building, so they know everyone can hear them. And it wasn't until my sister actually stuck her head out the window and asked them to please stop. And then they said, sorry, sorry, sorry. You know, they were apologetic. But before that, they would have known, okay, you're not just going to speak about this openly in public. My dad, who is obviously much older than me, has told me numerous times the difference that has happened over the years. Whereas before men knew, a woman, a child, or the elderly, you would hush, you would stop whatever nonsense you might be talking about. You would move out the way, you would give them the respect on the street. And it's interesting, the Prophet, peace be upon him, this is something that he spoke about as well, giving respect to the street for men who were out on the street for whatever reason, that they give respect to the street of not harassing women and to, I don't remember everything he said. Women, I think keeping the street clean, I don't remember what else. But this sort of code of honor that men had, even the men who would be on the street speaking about vulgar things, they would know respectfully enough, they would have enough honor, they would stop speaking that way in front of women, children, and older people. But now we've told men, these feminist women, who may very well be the minority, but they've told men, treat us equal, treat us equal, treat us equal. So now when we pass by and we hear that vulgarity, that talk of sex and violence and whatever else, then we experience that as toxic masculinity. And no, I'm not passing it off as boys will be boys. I think men need to teach boys how to be honorable men as well. But at the very least, when it came to gender relations, held a level of respect for women, even if they weren't respectful within their own group. But we've lost that. And now that we've lost that, we're trying to find it, but we're trying to do it in roundabout ways. Instead of admitting that was a mistake, we shouldn't have attacked chivalry, it was actually a very good thing for society. We'd rather have to continue to attack it, but then call what's left of it toxic masculinity and go about, Allahu Allah, trying to, what, feminize men, trying to create some kind of new way just so that you don't have to admit that the old way was better. It doesn't make any sense. And we would do ourselves so much better to nurture our nature. Those things that are natural about us, natural for men or natural for women, that we nurture it into positive outlet in society. That aggression and quote unquote violent, well not quote unquote violent, that physical strength that men naturally have, be tunneled into something good. That the nurturing aspect that women have be tunneled into something good. Because nurture is not always good. If you nurture the wrong person, or if you nurture too much or whatever, you can actually harm yourself and the other person. So each of those natural aspects need to be nurtured so that they have positive contributions to society. And so, unfortunately, I don't see the feminists or liberals admitting that they were wrong in attacking chivalry and admitting that toxic masculinity was the, is sort of the result of attacking chivalry. But nevertheless, at least if we as lay people continue to talk about these topics and not be so easily influenced by those with the loudest voices, hopefully we, just within our society, through the ground work, can continue to have these positive gender relationships, continue or revive positive gender relationships in our communities that will really be good for everyone. So thank you for listening, inshallah ta'ala. I look forward to doing the next podcast.

And so the most beneficial thing that we could do is to nurture our nature instead of problematizing different aspects of our various, not various, of our two genders. So for example, it happens on the other side too, a woman's ability to, or lack of ability to be more aggressive when it comes to, for example, trying to get a raise or even in the way we talk, then there's been studies that show that women use sorry a lot more, women use but a lot more, women sort of, I forget the exact name for it, but basically when you're talking and you're making a point, but then you kind of undermine yourself, like saying, I know this might be a stupid idea, but that sort of thing, that women tended to do that a lot more. And so instead of saying, instead of people in power or even as a community and society saying, well, how can we better hear women's voices? How can we not hear that automatically comparing it to men and think of it as weakness? How can we, as Carol Killigan put it, in a different voice, how can we hear that different voice and be just as, just as, what's the word I want to say? Sort of just as responsive, just as responsive to it as we would be for a man. So if we know, if studies have shown, our experience shows for this example, that women tend to say, I'm sorry, not because they're just so apologetic, but, or it could be, but they just tend to say sorry, almost in order to soften the blow because they don't want to be aggressive. Again, pointing to that, wanting to always keep relationships intact. So making sure that they're not hurting anyone's feelings. And so saying they're sorry is not because they are necessarily sorry, but that they want you to understand that even if they disagree with you, or even because they're asking for X, Y, and Z, doesn't mean that they want to hurt you in any way. So why can't we hear that voice instead of telling women, go out there and be more aggressive, tell the people in power, tell ourselves, the society, okay, let's acknowledge that this is the way that women talk and let's allow them to talk that way and really hear them as women instead of hearing them as weak versions of men. So this happens on both sides of constantly problematizing distinct features of each gender and making us, I don't know, sort of just picking and choosing what we like most about each gender and trying to create this new sort of genderless society where everyone is upheld by the same standards. And I think I already mentioned that that is actually one of the goals of radical feminism. And radical feminism, going by the textbook definition, believes that sexism is deeply rooted in society and therefore in order to get rid of sexism, we have to get rid of gender. We have to become a genderless society. And you see a lot of radical feminism in that textbook definition throughout our society. I mean, going so far as to try and promote using pronouns like zur instead of her or him. And why do I find that problematic is that basis go beyond just gender. So it's true that some of the stereotypes that we've made up about gender or some of the the expectations that we have of different genders are just nonsense. It's completely true. Blue is for boys and pink is for girls. It's nonsense. And in fact, if you go far enough, I'm not sure exactly when it was, I think it was either Vox or like BuzzFeed did a video about this, that if you The blue was for girls. And so, yeah, the blue is for girls. And so, yeah, some things are silly. But other things are very closely related to our biology. So I can't, it's not fair for women to judge men as aggressive for just being men. Now, a man in the male group, in the male group, then men can judge if a man is too aggressive because they have a different, they can recognize what is simply strength and competition and what is aggression and someone going too far. But as women, we can't recognize that. Just as women, we can recognize someone being kind and relational and not being weak. Whereas a man may see a woman showcasing certain characteristics and think of that as weak. Whereas if he just knew better, if he understood women better, he would realize that was not what was going on. So that's a part of the issue that there are some things that are better judged within a particular gender and that we can't as easily judge as outsiders. Now, I don't believe that like men are from Mars, women are from Venus. You know, obviously no one takes that literally. I don't think that there are just so many dramatic differences between men and women that we can never understand each other. But I do think that there are some aspects that we understand about each other or that we understand better inside our group than we can ever understand about the outside group. So I spoke about chivalry in this post and the way that it's been lost because it was attacked, really. And it's not even just to say it was attacked in the past. It's still being attacked. There were still articles, I think, written as early or let's see, as far back. I'm missing a word here. But there were articles as recently as I think 2012, 13 that I was still seeing as just completely bashing chivalry. And even one article that I came across that was promoting chivalry in the comment section. Some people are bashing chivalry. And one of the reasons that people bash chivalry, especially people coming from the feminist, radical feminist framework, knowingly or unknowingly, is that it points to gender differences. And some of the things about chivalry point to the fact or rather stand as a representation that men are stronger than women and women are weaker than men. And this is part of the reason that some women have an issue with it. But the interesting thing to me and why I went through all of this about gender differences is that there are, in fact, differences between men and women, especially when you talk about physically, biologically, and yes, even some hardwired personality traits that you find more often in one than in the other. So men have a superior physical strength. If it's about physical strength, if it's about competition, whatever we're talking about, men are going to win. And that is why, and it saddens me, it saddens me a lot. But then the more I study these things, the more I understand that it's not just men who have changed. There have been active voices in the feminist community that have told men that this traditional chivalry is bad and that a lot of men have taken that, have listened to that and have followed suit. So sometimes when I go on a train, and I see mostly men sitting down and women standing up, it really saddens me because chivalry is to acknowledge, if we want to put it in liberal terms, it's for men to acknowledge their privilege. And liberals are always talking about people acknowledging their privilege. White people need to acknowledge their privilege. Cis people, which is basically cis people in their fancy academic terms, who are born in the gender that corresponds to their physical body. They want cis people to acknowledge their privilege. They want white people to acknowledge their privilege. They want men to acknowledge their privilege. Well, chivalry was men acknowledging their privilege and doing something about it. So chivalry is a man acknowledging, I am more powerful than you. And with that power, I'm going to use it in your service instead of using it against you. If it comes to seats on a train, if it comes to who's going to get to sit down, if it's about competition and physical strength, men are going to sit down because they have superior strength. They are more competitive. But if men recognize that physical strength and that competition and that competitiveness and they say, I recognize that, I recognize my privilege in liberal terms, and I'm going to use it, but in the service of women, when I see a woman on the train, coming onto the train, I'm going to get up and give her this seat because I have more stamina, because I have more physical strength, because I have a greater leaning towards competitiveness. I have everything that could beat her to that seat, whether it's we're both walking in the train and there's one seat and it could be me, you know, the guy or the girl, the seat already, and he chooses to give it up for her, then he is recognizing that privilege and he's giving it over to her. It's like, if we want to use a more familiar example in our times, it's like if a white person sees a black person being pulled over by the cops and they stop and stay in that area and on look as everything goes down because they know as a white person, privilege of very oftentimes being respected by the police more than black people. If they recognize that and they use that privilege in the service of black people, isn't that a good thing? So why is it that when men recognize their privilege and they use it in the service of women, they were attacked? Like it doesn't, it doesn't quite add up. And I think what's funny to me is that feminists, they have the biggest voices, they're the loudest in the room. And sometimes a lot of women have to suffer because of them. So to have, and I think it's also the level of anger as well. I think that men in general do not like female anger, like they don't want to deal with it. They would rather run away than have to deal with an angry woman. That's, Allah Allah, that's sort of my perception. So I think that because of the anger and because of those feminist women being the loudest voices, that a lot of men have actually become afraid of being chivalrous because they don't want that anger. They don't want to open a door for someone and they just, and the woman rolls her eyes or the woman says, I don't need you to hold the door for me or whatever else. They don't want that bad interaction. So then they just stifle themselves and, and don't use that, um, those chivalrous gestures. And I think it's really unfortunate because here we had an entire code of honor in chivalry. And I don't know why when we talk about chivalry, a lot of the times people want to go back to the days of the knights and the chivalrous code of honor. Yes, it has roots there, but chivalry is known all over the world. Any society that acknowledges gender differences, there will be chivalry. Either that or the women will be oppressed because it's one or the other. They can recognize their privilege and use it in service of women, or they choose to not recognize their privilege or they recognize it and they just don't use it in service to women. And this is what I spoke about in the article that our experience as women of what we're calling now toxic masculinity is really men being men. It's men being themselves and not filtering themselves to women because we told them not to because we as women kept telling them we're equal, treat us equally, treat us equally. And so when men treat us equally, we're like, whoa, we don't, we don't like this. This is toxic. And, um, there was already a solution in place for that. And it's not that I condone, um, something like, let's see, something like quote unquote, what they call it. A locker room talk. I certainly don't condone that. I certainly don't think that men should ever speak, um, sexually about women, uh, both ways, men or women. It's just inappropriate in general. It's not modest. But at least before there was a point where if a woman walked into the room, then the men would all just keep quiet because they knew that it was inappropriate, immodest to do that in front of a woman. Whereas now a lot of men may just keep talking. And this was chivalry towards very often, not just women, but women, children, and older people. But now men will just keep talking unless women, there's this one incident that happened when I was back home in New York. And there were some people in front of our apartment, some young men, and they were talking about all their nonsense about women talking, talking, talking. And they're, they're in an apartment building, so they know everyone can hear them. And it wasn't until my sister actually stuck her head out the window and asked them to please stop. And then they said, sorry, sorry, sorry. You know, they were apologetic. But before that, they would have known, okay, you're not just going to speak about this openly in public. My dad, who is obviously much older than me, has told me numerous times the difference that has happened over the years. Whereas before men knew, a woman, a child, or the elderly, you would hush, you would stop whatever nonsense you might be talking about. You would move out the way, you would give them the respect on the street. And it's interesting, the Prophet, peace be upon him, this is something that he spoke about as well, giving respect to the street for men who were out on the street for whatever reason, that they give respect to the street of not harassing women and to, I don't remember everything he said. Women, I think keeping the street clean, I don't remember what else. But this sort of code of honor that men had, even the men who would be on the street speaking about vulgar things, they would know respectfully enough, they would have enough honor, they would stop speaking that way in front of women, children, and older people. But now we've told men, these feminist women, who may very well be the minority, but they've told men, treat us equal, treat us equal, treat us equal. So now when we pass by and we hear that vulgarity, that talk of sex and violence and whatever else, then we experience that as toxic masculinity. And no, I'm not passing it off as boys will be boys. I think men need to teach boys how to be honorable men as well. But at the very least, when it came to gender relations, held a level of respect for women, even if they weren't respectful within their own group. But we've lost that. And now that we've lost that, we're trying to find it, but we're trying to do it in roundabout ways. Instead of admitting that was a mistake, we shouldn't have attacked chivalry, it was actually a very good thing for society. We'd rather have to continue to attack it, but then call what's left of it toxic masculinity and go about, Allahu Allah, trying to, what, feminize men, trying to create some kind of new way just so that you don't have to admit that the old way was better. It doesn't make any sense. And we would do ourselves so much better to nurture our nature. Those things that are natural about us, natural for men or natural for women, that we nurture it into positive outlet in society. That aggression and quote unquote violent, well not quote unquote violent, that physical strength that men naturally have, be tunneled into something good. That the nurturing aspect that women have be tunneled into something good. Because nurture is not always good. If you nurture the wrong person, or if you nurture too much or whatever, you can actually harm yourself and the other person. So each of those natural aspects need to be nurtured so that they have positive contributions to society. And so, unfortunately, I don't see the feminists or liberals admitting that they were wrong in attacking chivalry and admitting that toxic masculinity was the, is sort of the result of attacking chivalry. But nevertheless, at least if we as lay people continue to talk about these topics and not be so easily influenced by those with the loudest voices, hopefully we, just within our society, through the ground work, can continue to have these positive gender relationships, continue or revive positive gender relationships in our communities that will really be good for everyone.
