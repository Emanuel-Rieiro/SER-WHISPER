{"text": " This is our first two-part episode. We have had one double episode, but we made that one big long thing, but we thought this time we would experiment with splitting it in two just to make it a little more approachable, I guess. I got some feedback on the other one, basically. A couple people were like, oh, it just seemed too long, even though people seemed to enjoy it. That's episode 17, by the way, The Powers That Be. Plugging her in this episode. But this one, focus on the now. 22 A and B. Race and fandom. And it does what it says on the tin. So the way that this episode came about was our regular contributor, Toast, did a series of posts about statistics, as she does, talking about Star Wars and how Finn and Poe were a very popular pairing at first. And then their popularity has decreased, at least comparatively, I think absolutely also, while Kylux has become more and more popular since The Force Awakens came out. Okay, wait. More specifics. She's talking about AO3 and Tumblr. Correct. It's fanfiction and what gets tagged on Tumblr in terms of content. And as we discussed, Tumblr isn't great at tagging, but it's logical to assume that everyone is proportionally bad at tagging on Tumblr. So if you've got a ship... Right. And of course, AO3 doesn't cover all fanfiction, and she tried to account for that. Exactly. But the point is that the trends were disturbing. You can't look at those stats without being like, there is a race thing happening here. Wait, wait, wait. Also, I don't think they explained who Kylux was, because if that doesn't make sense to you, it's probably because you don't even remember General Hux. Space Nazi. He, played by Donald Gleeson, has like five lines and has shiny boots. My favorite meme about him was that he looks like he's watching you not use a coaster. And that is the permanent look on his face. So when we had Toast on to talk about these stats... Somehow, okay, I'm just saying, I'm just contextualizing what General Hux is, because if you're not in Star Wars, you may literally have no idea who we're talking about. But you probably know who Finn is. He is the male lead. He is a black man, played by John Boyega. Poe is Oscar Isaac, and Rey is the female lead. We're not even talking about her, are we? No, basically not at all. Anyway, Star Wars. Okay, so, you know, the first thing you think when you look at this, and the first thing a lot of people think is, okay, there's some racism going on here, whether it's explicit or implicit and, you know, whatever, whatever the, if that makes a difference, the outcome is the same. Right. But as we started talking about it with Toast, we realized that this is podcasting, so you can't see us, but I am white, Elizabeth is white, Toast is white, and we were about to be three white women pontificating about race, and that's not a good look. No. So we decided that we wanted to devote some actual time to inviting people of color to talk about this issue, to reaching out to people of color and interviewing them about it, and basically to not be white women pontificating about race, but instead to provide a platform for other people to talk about this issue. Right. And, you know, if you heard the last episode, we asked specifically about this, and this is, you know, I spent a lot of time with the audio as I've edited it over the last few days. I think this was said, but people talk about this as a microcosm or, you know, a very illustrative example of broader trends in fandom. The privileging of white guys, frankly, we'll be talking a little bit about, gender will come into this, but it's definitely the privileging of white characters over characters of color. This is a movie with characters of color in the lead, and somehow they don't get to be in the lead in fandom's mind. And, like, what's going on here, basically, is a question that we want to explore. Right. And this was all underlined by the fact that, coincidentally, at about the same time as Destination Post, Destination Post, listen to me, Destination Toast posted her stats, there came out a meta by Franzesca, which covered issues of race and gender in fandom, but really got talked about because of the way that it handled race, which a lot of people found very problematic. And we're going to link to the meta and to a lot of responses to it in the show notes, but we wanted to call it out because it hit at just the right time to be tied up in this conversation and to be a major issue. This became part of the discourse. Yeah, I mean, the basic way to say it is, like, it's discussing preference. So, you know, if you're working from a point of saying fandom privilege, fandom, and this is such a, like, obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about what is fandom, we're talking about transformative fandom, female-dominated, fan-fiction-y kind of fandom. And, obviously, you see parallels in other corners of fandom or media consumption or society at large, but this is who we're talking about. You're talking about preference, saying, if you always go for the white guys, like, oh, you know, like, there's a lot of ways you can excuse it, right, or you can attempt to excuse it. And so that's basically what it was going at, and there were a lot of problems. Some of our guests are going to be talking about this, but this has been a huge part of this discourse. So if you haven't read it, you obviously don't have to, but I think, will we link to it? Yeah, go to the show notes. I think it's important for everybody to read to have context. If you want to engage with this, but absolutely, I would say if you don't want to, there's absolutely no reason why you should. And I would say that about any meta or any bland discourse. Don't, if you think it's going to make you mad, you can also just skip it. And we'll, you know, we'll be linking to a bunch of commentary that our guests have provided for us. So I think that's probably all the context that our listeners need if they haven't been deep in this discussion in the last few weeks. Do you think that's true? Yeah, I agree. So just a couple of notes about format. We put out a call and we got so many respondents that we really wanted to take everybody and we have. So that's part of why this is going to be a double episode. Just as an aside, sometimes we kind of beat ourselves up over like trying to keep things to like an hour. These two, because we didn't want to have to cut anyone out or really, really edit anyone down significantly. These two are a little over an hour, perhaps a bit more than an hour. And I would kind of love to know, not about this in particular, but in general, like if anyone has any feelings about length, if you see like an hour 10 and you're like, no, I can't do that in my life. If that makes a difference to you, I get the sense that most of our listeners listen when they can, you know, maybe listen when they're interested in the topic and won't say no. I'm only thinking about this too, because I'm producing a podcast professionally and we're constantly talking about like how it needs to be less than half an hour and developers have limited time. So like maybe I'm letting this infect it and maybe this is not an issue. So anyway. Right. But let us, but let us know your thoughts on how long fansplaining should be because we're obviously still experimenting with format. Yes. Yes. That's what I was trying to say. Right. And with the note of experimenting with format, just so that you know what to prepare for, for this episode, part one, we're going to have five contributors, four of them we're going to interview and three of them have prepared statements that we're going to play. So first we're going to hear from Holly Quinn. She prepared a statement. Then we're going to interview Rukmini Pandey. Then we're going to hear from Shadowkeeper with a prepared statement. Then Cleo we'll interview. And then PJ Poonla is going to, we'll roll her statement. We'll introduce the other five contributors in the next episode. What you need to know about these prepared statements is we basically to the group of six, gave them a series of kind of broad questions. And the one great thing about Holly Quinn going first is she pretty clearly states the question that we asked and then gives an answer. So you'll know immediately what those questions were. They're basically about like broad perceptions of race and fandom and also how that affects our respondents personally. Do you think they need to know anything else? I think that that's good. So why don't we hear from Holly? Awesome. Hi, my name's Holly Quinn. I run the blog, diverse high fantasy. On Tumblr, my fandoms include star Wars, the walking dead and kill joys. And most of my fan writing is representation in media commentary. Do you see racism underlying fandoms pairing preferences? Absolutely. There's no question about it with fandom. The kind of racism that you most commonly see isn't things like racial slurs and hate speech and white hoods. What you really see is a constant communal prioritization of white people and white characters, even when there are non-white characters in major roles. This is a trend across almost all fandoms. There are very few exceptions. How have fandoms attitudes on race affected you personally? I'm affected by it every day. I see it every day. Every time that I go on to Tumblr, every time I enter a fan space and it's had a lot of impact on me in that fandom has made me feel like I'm a part of a community. It made me more aware that racism is really that ubiquitous, even among people who consider themselves progressive. And a lot of people, even in the U S are actually, I think really isolated from people of color, especially black people. How have fandoms attitudes changed in the time that you've been involved in fandom? I've been in online fandom since the nineties. The changes that I've seen in fandom, as far as race really have more to do with the increase in black voices in fandom than any real overall changes in attitude. I do think there's more white fans who are interested in, in black characters or characters of color simply because there are more of them. But I think overall the patterns are the same. You see the same comments, the same discourse, the same everything. You know, I can see the same comments being made about Michonne today that you would see 20 years ago.

We have had one double episode, but we made that one big long thing, but we thought this time we would experiment with splitting it in two just to make it a little more approachable, I guess. I got some feedback on the other one, basically. A couple people were like, oh, it just seemed too long, even though people seemed to enjoy it. That's episode 17, by the way, The Powers That Be. Plugging her in this episode. But this one, focus on the now. 22 A and B. Race and fandom. And it does what it says on the tin. So the way that this episode came about was our regular contributor, Toast, did a series of posts about statistics, as she does, talking about Star Wars and how Finn and Poe were a very popular pairing at first. And then their popularity has decreased, at least comparatively, I think absolutely also, while Kylux has become more and more popular since The Force Awakens came out. Okay, wait. More specifics. She's talking about AO3 and Tumblr. Correct. It's fanfiction and what gets tagged on Tumblr in terms of content. And as we discussed, Tumblr isn't great at tagging, but it's logical to assume that everyone is proportionally bad at tagging on Tumblr. So if you've got a ship... Right. And of course, AO3 doesn't cover all fanfiction, and she tried to account for that. Exactly. But the point is that the trends were disturbing. You can't look at those stats without being like, there is a race thing happening here. Wait, wait, wait. Also, I don't think they explained who Kylux was, because if that doesn't make sense to you, it's probably because you don't even remember General Hux. Space Nazi. He, played by Donald Gleeson, has like five lines and has shiny boots. My favorite meme about him was that he looks like he's watching you not use a coaster. And that is the permanent look on his face. So when we had Toast on to talk about these stats... Somehow, okay, I'm just saying, I'm just contextualizing what General Hux is, because if you're not in Star Wars, you may literally have no idea who we're talking about. But you probably know who Finn is. He is the male lead. He is a black man, played by John Boyega. Poe is Oscar Isaac, and Rey is the female lead. We're not even talking about her, are we? No, basically not at all. Anyway, Star Wars. Okay, so, you know, the first thing you think when you look at this, and the first thing a lot of people think is, okay, there's some racism going on here, whether it's explicit or implicit and, you know, whatever, whatever the, if that makes a difference, the outcome is the same. Right. But as we started talking about it with Toast, we realized that this is podcasting, so you can't see us, but I am white, Elizabeth is white, Toast is white, and we were about to be three white women pontificating about race, and that's not a good look. No. So we decided that we wanted to devote some actual time to inviting people of color to talk about this issue, to reaching out to people of color and interviewing them about it, and basically to not be white women pontificating about race, but instead to provide a platform for other people to talk about this issue. Right. And, you know, if you heard the last episode, we asked specifically about this, and this is, you know, I spent a lot of time with the audio as I've edited it over the last few days. I think this was said, but people talk about this as a microcosm or, you know, a very illustrative example of broader trends in fandom. The privileging of white guys, frankly, we'll be talking a little bit about, gender will come into this, but it's definitely the privileging of white characters over characters of color. This is a movie with characters of color in the lead, and somehow they don't get to be in the lead in fandom's mind. And, like, what's going on here, basically, is a question that we want to explore. Right. And this was all underlined by the fact that, coincidentally, at about the same time as Destination Post, Destination Post, listen to me, Destination Toast posted her stats, there came out a meta by Franzesca, which covered issues of race and gender in fandom, but really got talked about because of the way that it handled race, which a lot of people found very problematic. And we're going to link to the meta and to a lot of responses to it in the show notes, but we wanted to call it out because it hit at just the right time to be tied up in this conversation and to be a major issue. This became part of the discourse. Yeah, I mean, the basic way to say it is, like, it's discussing preference. So, you know, if you're working from a point of saying fandom privilege, fandom, and this is such a, like, obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about what is fandom, we're talking about transformative fandom, female-dominated, fan-fiction-y kind of fandom. And, obviously, you see parallels in other corners of fandom or media consumption or society at large, but this is who we're talking about. You're talking about preference, saying, if you always go for the white guys, like, oh, you know, like, there's a lot of ways you can excuse it, right, or you can attempt to excuse it. And so that's basically what it was going at, and there were a lot of problems. Some of our guests are going to be talking about this, but this has been a huge part of this discourse. So if you haven't read it, you obviously don't have to, but I think, will we link to it? Yeah, go to the show notes. I think it's important for everybody to read to have context. If you want to engage with this, but absolutely, I would say if you don't want to, there's absolutely no reason why you should. And I would say that about any meta or any bland discourse. Don't, if you think it's going to make you mad, you can also just skip it. And we'll, you know, we'll be linking to a bunch of commentary that our guests have provided for us. So I think that's probably all the context that our listeners need if they haven't been deep in this discussion in the last few weeks. Do you think that's true? Yeah, I agree. So just a couple of notes about format. We put out a call and we got so many respondents that we really wanted to take everybody and we have. So that's part of why this is going to be a double episode. Just as an aside, sometimes we kind of beat ourselves up over like trying to keep things to like an hour. These two, because we didn't want to have to cut anyone out or really, really edit anyone down significantly. These two are a little over an hour, perhaps a bit more than an hour. And I would kind of love to know, not about this in particular, but in general, like if anyone has any feelings about length, if you see like an hour 10 and you're like, no, I can't do that in my life. If that makes a difference to you, I get the sense that most of our listeners listen when they can, you know, maybe listen when they're interested in the topic and won't say no. I'm only thinking about this too, because I'm producing a podcast professionally and we're constantly talking about like how it needs to be less than half an hour and developers have limited time. So like maybe I'm letting this infect it and maybe this is not an issue. So anyway. Right. But let us, but let us know your thoughts on how long fansplaining should be because we're obviously still experimenting with format. Yes. Yes. That's what I was trying to say. Right. And with the note of experimenting with format, just so that you know what to prepare for, for this episode, part one, we're going to have five contributors, four of them we're going to interview and three of them have prepared statements that we're going to play. So first we're going to hear from Holly Quinn. She prepared a statement. Then we're going to interview Rukmini Pandey. Then we're going to hear from Shadowkeeper with a prepared statement. Then Cleo we'll interview. And then PJ Poonla is going to, we'll roll her statement. We'll introduce the other five contributors in the next episode. What you need to know about these prepared statements is we basically to the group of six, gave them a series of kind of broad questions. And the one great thing about Holly Quinn going first is she pretty clearly states the question that we asked and then gives an answer. So you'll know immediately what those questions were. They're basically about like broad perceptions of race and fandom and also how that affects our respondents personally. Do you think they need to know anything else? I think that that's good. So why don't we hear from Holly? Awesome. Hi, my name's Holly Quinn. I run the blog, diverse high fantasy. On Tumblr, my fandoms include star Wars, the walking dead and kill joys. And most of my fan writing is representation in media commentary. Do you see racism underlying fandoms pairing preferences? Absolutely. There's no question about it with fandom. The kind of racism that you most commonly see isn't things like racial slurs and hate speech and white hoods. What you really see is a constant communal prioritization of white people and white characters, even when there are non-white characters in major roles. This is a trend across almost all fandoms. There are very few exceptions. How have fandoms attitudes on race affected you personally? I'm affected by it every day. I see it every day. Every time that I go on to Tumblr, every time I enter a fan space and it's had a lot of impact on me in that fandom has made me feel like I'm a part of a community. It made me more aware that racism is really that ubiquitous, even among people who consider themselves progressive. And a lot of people, even in the U S are actually, I think really isolated from people of color, especially black people. How have fandoms attitudes changed in the time that you've been involved in fandom? I've been in online fandom since the nineties. The changes that I've seen in fandom, as far as race really have more to do with the increase in black voices in fandom than any real overall changes in attitude. I do think there's more white fans who are interested in, in black characters or characters of color simply because there are more of them. But I think overall the patterns are the same. You see the same comments, the same discourse, the same everything. You know, I can see the same comments being made about Michonne today that you would see 20 years ago.
