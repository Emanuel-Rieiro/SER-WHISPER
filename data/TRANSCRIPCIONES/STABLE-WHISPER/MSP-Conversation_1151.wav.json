{"text": " Have you seen Moonlight? Of course I've seen Moonlight. Moonlight's beautiful. Yeah, and the thing that I like most about that is, it's like, yeah, it's about a gay relationship, but it's not, it's not, I was like waiting for the day that, that he was going to get beaten up because he's gay. He was never beaten up because he was gay, he was just beaten up because... Spoiler for anyone that's not seen it yet. Sorry, guys. But he was, it was just, it was just a love story. And that's what it was. It was also, I was waiting for it to be like, typically like a black community, but it was never, it was just, it was just a love story in a black community and that was it. And that's what I think is, I know that your monologue is about coming out and the difficulty of coming out, but it's still, because it's romantic and because it is the most romantic of the, the... Groups. Yeah, it makes it, it normalises. I don't want to make this a Moonlight review, but like, especially towards the end as well. Sorry, I really... Sorry. No, but towards the end, I don't know the actor's name. Yeah, which one? The main guy. Yeah. I don't know his name, but he looks a lot like 50 Cent in that. And you know what? I'm just like, I just, I'm like, you know what? Like, this is, this is awesome because it's, it's, it's taken like the, the, the stereotypical face and unfortunately, this is unfortunate, but like the way we see gay men and the stereotypes around that and it's just flipping it on its head and like, there's this guy that you probably, quite an alpha male, like a man that you probably like would imagine seeing in like, you know, like a completely different genre of film and he's this, especially when he's, you know, in that one scene and he's talking to this guy and he's like, you're the first guy that I've ever slept with. And he's so vulnerable, isn't he? And I've not, and he's so vulnerable and you're like, wow, like this is, this is what we needed. Do you know what I mean? And that film just like broke so many barriers and it's amazing. Go see it if you haven't. It definitely happens. Like it's not, like that, there's probably like so many people out there that's like, oh my God, that is my, that is my story. That is so me. And it's like, we need more things like that of people, like just maybe just stereotypes flipped on their head. Do you feel self-conscious or did you feel self-conscious when you started this and do you still feel so, do you still feel self-conscious kind of talk, not necessarily talking about sex, like in like a social situation, but do you feel self-conscious like talking about the fact that you are talking about sex? Do you know what I mean? Go on. It's, I didn't feel self-conscious ever when we were talking about it just in the room because we said from the beginning, this is a very safe space. We're not going to, anything we say in this room stays in this room. It was a, and I've known you guys for years. I'm comfortable with all of you. Yeah. But then every, and to be honest, it wasn't even the prospect of talking about sex in front of strangers and doing this monologue in front of strangers. It was the fact that my family were going to be like, I was just like, because even though it's not me, I don't know. It's just not the sort of conversations that we'd have. And the way you could get it. Actually, can I ask, sorry, I'm going to, I'm going to be like, I'm going to flip roles now. Did your parents ever like, you know, like following seeing that show, what did, what did they say anything like? What was it like? There's nothing changed now. They didn't know. They, they just, they thought it was a really, really good piece of writing and performed it well. That's amazing. Has it changed their, like their, their thinking about that topic and like, has it changed their mindset? I don't know. I need, I need to get into it. What's your monologue again? Sorry. It's about, have you said it yet? I haven't really actually. Yeah. So mine is, is, it's a bartender. Just, it starts off just talking about the general, things that she's noticed working in a bar, the sort of differences between men and women and the way that they act and the sort of, I don't want to say predatory, but that sort of approach that men have on a night out to women. And it's, it's probably an unfair perception. She makes a lot of bold statements about this is what, this is what all men do. This is what all women, women do. And it's not true necessarily, but that's her view of it. And then as it goes on, it gets more into the personal experiences and the guys that she slept with and why she slept with them, which is because she's very unhappy and depressed and just wants some sort of comfort and wants someone to. Validation. Yeah. Yeah. It is. It's validation. You bring up a really good point. Sorry to disturb you there, but you say, you know what you were saying about, like, it's her opinion. It's her view. People that come to this show, I don't think they should ever think at any point that what we're saying is the right or there is no right or wrong answer. This is like, we're not trying to be politically correct or anything. This is literally what we've written. And this is what we feel person. Every single monologue is maybe except an exception to yours because someone else wrote yours, Georgia, but an exception to that, it's very personal to us. And it's what we've found and something that we feel passionate about. If people tend to like, people might find like, might have a different opinion and might disagree. But the point is we're putting a perspective out there. We're putting our opinions out there and, you know, take it or leave it. Like, it's just a different it's a fresh. I think it raises questions. It does. Yeah. But also like, during like the whole, that show that we did that show, it literally, in between our, everyone's monologues, at moments people laughed at things you'd said. Yeah. And it made you think like, so it didn't make, well, about the self-consciousness thing. Like, when we're reading it and we're like, well, what if people don't agree with what we're saying? Like, you just said that. People laugh because people see things the same way. Do you know what I mean? And it was quite comforting to see that people were like, oh yeah, it's kind of true that that has happened to me. Yeah. To familiarise with the audience. I think that's why we had a connection straight away with them. And especially like, I think they, all of the monologues start off quite like on the surface and they're just sort of chatty and conversational. And so people, people are just like, oh yeah, I can relate to that. And then that gives them the connection they need to then when you go into the more emotional stuff and it gets a bit harder, they're then like, they're invested and they're listening to you. And they're thinking, oh, hang on, I could relate to that. And I, I don't know, it gives you a connection with the audience. Listen, what you were saying about like, about your opinion on boys like being predatory and it's like, then it's still like, it's in terms of like, you know, like gender, like roles and expectations of boys, like going out and just shagging loads of birds and all that. Even if that's, like obviously, like there's not every boy has that opinion when they're going out, but a lot of boys do. And even if it's not how they actually, not because they actually want to go out and have sex with other girls, but the like societal expectations. Yeah, it's that lad culture, isn't it? Okay, so I'll just do it because everyone else wants me to. So then, other people will see them as like, kind of like predatory. Yeah. But even if, but just because they're, they're pressured to maybe go and actually do it. Yeah. It's a domino effect. It's taken on that stereotype role, do you know what I mean? Because that's what, they, like, we think men, like women will be like, oh, men see us as all like weak and vulnerable and everything like that. Well, they have in their head that women see them as like henchmen. They have to be henchmen. It's the same thing. And I think that's the thing, the barrier between men and women is because of the stereotype. You, women have to, have to, like, I quote, it's like one-off quote, do you know what I mean? Have to see men as being henchmen. Men have to see women as being like a, a fluffy cloud. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? I mean, even the amount of guys that I've spoken to that I've, that I've, you know, that I've spoken to and that I'm really close to, and it's all like I was saying before, it's just an image. Like, I know guys who are yet to come out because they feel so vulnerable and they feel like they can't speak to someone because they've grown up and they've, they've, you know, I, people that play rugby, like I'm not, I don't want to, you know. Like that rugby player that came out. Yeah. Yeah. He had kids and an ex-wife and he was like 40 and because he was a rugby player he felt like he couldn't come out and then he did come out and he was like, oh, nothing's changed. Yeah. I really hope that, yeah, exactly. I really hope that's like a knock-on effect for other guys. Absolutely. So, do you think, this is a, kind of going off tangent of what we're talking about, but on your flyer or your poster it says, like, you want to cut through like the Instagram kind of bullshit. Yeah. Do you, and people always, like I overshare on Instagram more so than I ever have before, like I feel like Instagram has just like opened up a world where I can talk about everything. And it obviously pisses some people off, but like, do you think that exposing yourself online and like through social media is different to, and obviously the answer is yes, but how do you think it's different to exposing yourself on stage and doing these monologues? Because as well, on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and everything, I know plenty of people that live this fake life of, oh my God, look at me and my husband. Oh my God, look at me and my kids. And it's like, hang on a minute, it's the first time you see your kids all week or, oh my God, look what I did with my friends. Okay. But then having that image, because everyone's led to believe that's their life on social media because you don't actually see it. But I think because we did it on stage and said, not things we'd necessarily put on social media, it was there, we were, we was with each other. And I think again, the connection with the audience meant that we did strip back everything and talk about the deep issues. It's an emotional experience that you can't replicate online or any social media. I think there is a common thread between both of them though, because I always think the thing about when we were coming up with that like sort of tagline, the thing for me about Instagram and Facebook and Twitter is that you're deciding what you're going to show and how much you're going to show and what perspective you're going to put on that. And it's not necessarily an accurate representation. And with our monologues, we were deciding how much we were going to say and what we were going to say. And I know like bits that were actual experiences from our lives, whether we were going to change them and how we were going to write that. And so they do both have that element of, this is a, this is what I want to show you about myself. Like a curated aspect of it. But we, I think we did try with honestly to be completely honest and to just. Well, I think like. Not pun intended. I wrote the word like honestly and I was like, okay. But like the difference as well, like with the monologues, we've got, we've been given all like this 15 minute, whatever space just to talk. And so we can't, you're not going to be able to keep people captivated just by prattling on about, oh, my life's so great for 15 minutes. Like, oh, I've got to get chai latte and do all this weird. And we want. It was about being honest. Yeah. And we want people to actually feel like, feel emotionally involved and actually come out of the, come out of the fear of whatever being like, oh, I do maybe want to go home. I'm going to talk to my daughter and my son or whatever about some of this stuff. You can see right through it. Yeah. You can see right, right through it. If it's, if it's for 15 minutes, if you're stood there and you're just talking like, you know, excuse the word, but bullshit. Like, are you allowed to swear on this? Yeah. Bullshit. If you just stand there for 15 minutes and talk absolute bollocks, the audience are going to see right through you. Yeah. And that's why it was so important for Rachel to make sure that what we wrote, was genuine and was something that we could relate to. And that's, I think one of the, you know, the, the, the key highlights of the show, I think is just the amount of honesty that there is there. And I will admit it is, it is heightened at certain bits, but that's just for dramatic effect. And I mean, as for it to be like a play, like you're not going to just be stood there the whole time, you know, it's just very monotone, very boring. You have to heighten it just a bit to create an atmosphere. When we were writing, we were sort of coming back week on week with like a little bit of, a bit more of it that changed. And I kept, we kept, I know me and Billy talked about this a lot. I kept just getting really annoyed because every week I'd come back and Rachel would just be like, give me more, go deeper. This is still on the surface. I want to know more. And it took, I think it took me about two months before I finally got somewhere. And she was like, that's it. You've got there. It's amazing to talk about. And I just, like I said this already, but the fact that we've done that with Rachel, now like a relative of mine, she's so close to her. And I'm glad I've done it because, you know, it just feels like the natural progression. I've worked with Rachel since I was maybe 12 now and I'm 18 now. So it's, it's been a long time. And this show feels like the cherry on top, like the natural progression. And again, what we want to do for this show as well is we want it to feel like, you know, as part of the TV workshop, we have a younger group, a middle group. And then we have this members are like four and the oldest are what? 18 or something. 23. So as you can imagine, you start off doing these plays and then you do short films and we want Edinburgh Fringe and going to the Edinburgh to be like the, you know, the height, like the neck, like almost like, not the graduation, but you know, like the pinnacle of what, what we do at TV workshop. So where are we are setting like the preset for them? Yeah. Rachel wanted us to sort of learn how to function as our own theatre company and not just have her organising everything. It's wonderful as she is at organising everything. To get that experience is just incredibly valuable. We've been doing marketing. Yeah. Fundraising, all sorts. It's, it's really, really exciting. Yeah. And luckily with, with Rachel, we have like all these connections that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Like in terms of Edinburgh, like she knows the guy that like, the space, the space you get. Yeah, the thing with Edinburgh is we literally were just sat there after lunch and we were like, we're taking this to Edinburgh. Yeah, so anyone would have been to Edinburgh. And then Rachel's face just lit up like, I know someone, I've done this before. And we were all just like, oh my God, guys, we're going to Edinburgh. So it's like, oh, this is to Edinburgh Fringe, wasn't it? Yeah. It was in like a day. We were like, okay, Edinburgh Fringe. Okay, we'll go. We'll just go for it and do it. We filmed the guy up and we was like, okay, we'll pay you tomorrow. But no, we have to, we have to say it was really expensive. So I'm really, the TV workshop is such a beautiful community because we're also supportive of each other. The parents are, it's a charity as well. So the parents have been like donating and we've been doing fundraisers and social media and people have been just like, you know, like trying to get involved and engaging with us. And it's just really, it's just amazing to see really. Yeah. My final like feminist related question is, Vagina Monologues came out like 21 years ago. 21 years. We mentioned this earlier, but it's like an entirely different generation of women and men. Yeah, it was before all of us were born. Yeah. Little do you know, I'm 21. Do you think we talk about sexuality differently? Well, I'm not even your generation, that makes me sad. I always think I'm like 16. We talk about sexuality differently because of things I think like social media. Like I said, like I overshare everything. Like I'm really open about my sexuality. That's crazy because I do, I do think though, like, you know, when you think of the 60s and stuff and swinging 60s and I just, I remember growing up and learning about that. I just, I just assumed that like after the 50s, that was like a turning point in history and specifically in England. Well, I wouldn't know anywhere else, but like in England, that was the turning point. And since then, everyone's just been like very open about sex, you know, like things, films like Alfie, you know, is that the right film? Yeah. Like, I feel like it was like a change in culture. But although despite that, that it's the act, like the actual discussion side, like, because people were doing it, we were having sex, but talking about it, the discussion side and actually making it like being aware of what we're actually doing. That was what wasn't changing. I think. Yeah, education. It's really interesting that you brought up the 60s because I did actually just remember a conversation that me and my mum had when we were talking about the show, which was, she just said like, oh, you can talk about sex. Couldn't even say the word vagina in my house when you were growing up. Like, it just wasn't done. You wouldn't bring it up. Like, if you were on your period, you wouldn't mention it. Nothing. And then, so she was just like, I think it's great. I think it's great that you can, you guys can do this and talk about it. Vagina! Vagina! The thing with sex, like, as regards sexuality, like, are you gay? Are you bi? Are you straight? Or whatever else. I think that, I don't know, it's become more of a, I don't know, it kind of blocks people off nowadays. I mean, we go about and say, like, you can, you can be free, you can have what you want, you can have what relationship you want, gay marriage and all this. But you still get asked, like, what you are. I mean, exactly. But I'll tell you why that is, though. I do think that is because, as of recently, you know, in the last decade or whatever, and this has been this change in this generation, because it's all happened all at once, it is, for some people, a bit overwhelming. But I think naturally, over the next couple of years, because it's becoming more natural and people, not becoming more natural, but it's people are learning more about it, people are like, okay, like, that it's almost been, like, a lesson for everyone. And people now fully understand what's going on. Well, like, you know, are starting to understand. It's acceptable. And then over the, for example, in, say, 2015 or whatever, I feel like by that point, that's when people are like, okay, we understand it now. And it won't be so, like, there wouldn't be that negative connotations with all those words. And, you know, especially when you see on Facebook, like, there's a hundred, is it like a hundred genders or, like, all these things. Yeah, it's like, it's very fluid and non-binary and things like that. Lots of negative connotations. But I'd like to think that in a couple of years, when people are fully understanding that and sort of taking that in, that that no longer exists. I mean, I go to school and I mean, people walk past, not to me, but to other people, like, oh, you're gay, or what you're doing, you're dying. Not to me, but, you know, to other people. And it's like, it still has that harshness and the rudeness. Yeah, that's what it would mean, like, gay is, like, gay is bad. So if I call you gay, you are bad. They just, it kind of think for some kids have come just like a word that comes naturally, like, oh, you're a pisser. It's gay. And he'll call, he'll, like, if I do something that he doesn't like, he's like, oh, that's gay. But he just, I think he's trying to, like, take it back. Yeah. Because he's like, it's fine, I can say that. Take ownership of it, yeah. Because I am gay. It's weird. I don't know. So, when, can you tell me, do you know where it is in Edinburgh yet? It's the Royal Mile. The space on the Royal Mile. And that's what it's called, the space. The space, yeah. And you're there the whole of? No, we're there from. From the 4th to the 12th of August, but we're not doing it on the 6th. And that's when we'll be out and about. Dressed as the Spice Girls. So if you see, if you see a guy dressed as Mel B and a bunch of girls dressed as Spice Girls, we want you to come and say hi to us and, like, enjoy Edinburgh together. And if you see a girl in a really small dress in a really cold Scotland, that's me as Posh Spice, I'm not being really stupid about it. And where can people find, like, the TV workshop to find out a bit more about that? Okay, social media. Yes. Okay, so the hashtag, for the show is TVWSHonestly, and that's on Twitter, and I think on Facebook as well. So if you search that, hopefully everything should come up. TV Workshop is just at TV Workshop Salford. And Facebook as Television Workshop Salford. We've also got an Indiegogo page to raise funds, and there's lots of exciting merchandise and stuff. Yeah, you can, so it's not just, we're not saying, oh, please give us some money. It's like, oh, if you give us five pounds, you can get, like, a picture of us, get some duff, get a nice little canvas bag. Yeah, we did, like, a photo shoot with, we did a photo shoot with Timeless Photography. Yeah, Alan's, he's a brilliant, he's actually just won an award for photography as well, so we're like, yeah, we've got, like, a world-winning photographer taking our pictures. He's great, he's great, and it's, like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Thank you so much. Thank you for having us.

Of course I've seen Moonlight. Moonlight's beautiful. Yeah, and the thing that I like most about that is, it's like, yeah, it's about a gay relationship, but it's not, it's not, I was like waiting for the day that, that he was going to get beaten up because he's gay. He was never beaten up because he was gay, he was just beaten up because... Spoiler for anyone that's not seen it yet. Sorry, guys. But he was, it was just, it was just a love story. And that's what it was. It was also, I was waiting for it to be like, typically like a black community, but it was never, it was just, it was just a love story in a black community and that was it. And that's what I think is, I know that your monologue is about coming out and the difficulty of coming out, but it's still, because it's romantic and because it is the most romantic of the, the... Groups. Yeah, it makes it, it normalises. I don't want to make this a Moonlight review, but like, especially towards the end as well. Sorry, I really... Sorry. No, but towards the end, I don't know the actor's name. Yeah, which one? The main guy. Yeah. I don't know his name, but he looks a lot like 50 Cent in that. And you know what? I'm just like, I just, I'm like, you know what? Like, this is, this is awesome because it's, it's, it's taken like the, the, the stereotypical face and unfortunately, this is unfortunate, but like the way we see gay men and the stereotypes around that and it's just flipping it on its head and like, there's this guy that you probably, quite an alpha male, like a man that you probably like would imagine seeing in like, you know, like a completely different genre of film and he's this, especially when he's, you know, in that one scene and he's talking to this guy and he's like, you're the first guy that I've ever slept with. And he's so vulnerable, isn't he? And I've not, and he's so vulnerable and you're like, wow, like this is, this is what we needed. Do you know what I mean? And that film just like broke so many barriers and it's amazing. Go see it if you haven't. It definitely happens. Like it's not, like that, there's probably like so many people out there that's like, oh my God, that is my, that is my story. That is so me. And it's like, we need more things like that of people, like just maybe just stereotypes flipped on their head. Do you feel self-conscious or did you feel self-conscious when you started this and do you still feel so, do you still feel self-conscious kind of talk, not necessarily talking about sex, like in like a social situation, but do you feel self-conscious like talking about the fact that you are talking about sex? Do you know what I mean? Go on. It's, I didn't feel self-conscious ever when we were talking about it just in the room because we said from the beginning, this is a very safe space. We're not going to, anything we say in this room stays in this room. It was a, and I've known you guys for years. I'm comfortable with all of you. Yeah. But then every, and to be honest, it wasn't even the prospect of talking about sex in front of strangers and doing this monologue in front of strangers. It was the fact that my family were going to be like, I was just like, because even though it's not me, I don't know. It's just not the sort of conversations that we'd have. And the way you could get it. Actually, can I ask, sorry, I'm going to, I'm going to be like, I'm going to flip roles now. Did your parents ever like, you know, like following seeing that show, what did, what did they say anything like? What was it like? There's nothing changed now. They didn't know. They, they just, they thought it was a really, really good piece of writing and performed it well. That's amazing. Has it changed their, like their, their thinking about that topic and like, has it changed their mindset? I don't know. I need, I need to get into it. What's your monologue again? Sorry. It's about, have you said it yet? I haven't really actually. Yeah. So mine is, is, it's a bartender. Just, it starts off just talking about the general, things that she's noticed working in a bar, the sort of differences between men and women and the way that they act and the sort of, I don't want to say predatory, but that sort of approach that men have on a night out to women. And it's, it's probably an unfair perception. She makes a lot of bold statements about this is what, this is what all men do. This is what all women, women do. And it's not true necessarily, but that's her view of it. And then as it goes on, it gets more into the personal experiences and the guys that she slept with and why she slept with them, which is because she's very unhappy and depressed and just wants some sort of comfort and wants someone to. Validation. Yeah. Yeah. It is. It's validation. You bring up a really good point. Sorry to disturb you there, but you say, you know what you were saying about, like, it's her opinion. It's her view. People that come to this show, I don't think they should ever think at any point that what we're saying is the right or there is no right or wrong answer. This is like, we're not trying to be politically correct or anything. This is literally what we've written. And this is what we feel person. Every single monologue is maybe except an exception to yours because someone else wrote yours, Georgia, but an exception to that, it's very personal to us. And it's what we've found and something that we feel passionate about. If people tend to like, people might find like, might have a different opinion and might disagree. But the point is we're putting a perspective out there. We're putting our opinions out there and, you know, take it or leave it. Like, it's just a different it's a fresh. I think it raises questions. It does. Yeah. But also like, during like the whole, that show that we did that show, it literally, in between our, everyone's monologues, at moments people laughed at things you'd said. Yeah. And it made you think like, so it didn't make, well, about the self-consciousness thing. Like, when we're reading it and we're like, well, what if people don't agree with what we're saying? Like, you just said that. People laugh because people see things the same way. Do you know what I mean? And it was quite comforting to see that people were like, oh yeah, it's kind of true that that has happened to me. Yeah. To familiarise with the audience. I think that's why we had a connection straight away with them. And especially like, I think they, all of the monologues start off quite like on the surface and they're just sort of chatty and conversational. And so people, people are just like, oh yeah, I can relate to that. And then that gives them the connection they need to then when you go into the more emotional stuff and it gets a bit harder, they're then like, they're invested and they're listening to you. And they're thinking, oh, hang on, I could relate to that. And I, I don't know, it gives you a connection with the audience. Listen, what you were saying about like, about your opinion on boys like being predatory and it's like, then it's still like, it's in terms of like, you know, like gender, like roles and expectations of boys, like going out and just shagging loads of birds and all that. Even if that's, like obviously, like there's not every boy has that opinion when they're going out, but a lot of boys do. And even if it's not how they actually, not because they actually want to go out and have sex with other girls, but the like societal expectations. Yeah, it's that lad culture, isn't it? Okay, so I'll just do it because everyone else wants me to. So then, other people will see them as like, kind of like predatory. Yeah. But even if, but just because they're, they're pressured to maybe go and actually do it. Yeah. It's a domino effect. It's taken on that stereotype role, do you know what I mean? Because that's what, they, like, we think men, like women will be like, oh, men see us as all like weak and vulnerable and everything like that. Well, they have in their head that women see them as like henchmen. They have to be henchmen. It's the same thing. And I think that's the thing, the barrier between men and women is because of the stereotype. You, women have to, have to, like, I quote, it's like one-off quote, do you know what I mean? Have to see men as being henchmen. Men have to see women as being like a, a fluffy cloud. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? I mean, even the amount of guys that I've spoken to that I've, that I've, you know, that I've spoken to and that I'm really close to, and it's all like I was saying before, it's just an image. Like, I know guys who are yet to come out because they feel so vulnerable and they feel like they can't speak to someone because they've grown up and they've, they've, you know, I, people that play rugby, like I'm not, I don't want to, you know. Like that rugby player that came out. Yeah. Yeah. He had kids and an ex-wife and he was like 40 and because he was a rugby player he felt like he couldn't come out and then he did come out and he was like, oh, nothing's changed. Yeah. I really hope that, yeah, exactly. I really hope that's like a knock-on effect for other guys. Absolutely. So, do you think, this is a, kind of going off tangent of what we're talking about, but on your flyer or your poster it says, like, you want to cut through like the Instagram kind of bullshit. Yeah. Do you, and people always, like I overshare on Instagram more so than I ever have before, like I feel like Instagram has just like opened up a world where I can talk about everything. And it obviously pisses some people off, but like, do you think that exposing yourself online and like through social media is different to, and obviously the answer is yes, but how do you think it's different to exposing yourself on stage and doing these monologues? Because as well, on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and everything, I know plenty of people that live this fake life of, oh my God, look at me and my husband. Oh my God, look at me and my kids. And it's like, hang on a minute, it's the first time you see your kids all week or, oh my God, look what I did with my friends. Okay. But then having that image, because everyone's led to believe that's their life on social media because you don't actually see it. But I think because we did it on stage and said, not things we'd necessarily put on social media, it was there, we were, we was with each other. And I think again, the connection with the audience meant that we did strip back everything and talk about the deep issues. It's an emotional experience that you can't replicate online or any social media. I think there is a common thread between both of them though, because I always think the thing about when we were coming up with that like sort of tagline, the thing for me about Instagram and Facebook and Twitter is that you're deciding what you're going to show and how much you're going to show and what perspective you're going to put on that. And it's not necessarily an accurate representation. And with our monologues, we were deciding how much we were going to say and what we were going to say. And I know like bits that were actual experiences from our lives, whether we were going to change them and how we were going to write that. And so they do both have that element of, this is a, this is what I want to show you about myself. Like a curated aspect of it. But we, I think we did try with honestly to be completely honest and to just. Well, I think like. Not pun intended. I wrote the word like honestly and I was like, okay. But like the difference as well, like with the monologues, we've got, we've been given all like this 15 minute, whatever space just to talk. And so we can't, you're not going to be able to keep people captivated just by prattling on about, oh, my life's so great for 15 minutes. Like, oh, I've got to get chai latte and do all this weird. And we want. It was about being honest. Yeah. And we want people to actually feel like, feel emotionally involved and actually come out of the, come out of the fear of whatever being like, oh, I do maybe want to go home. I'm going to talk to my daughter and my son or whatever about some of this stuff. You can see right through it. Yeah. You can see right, right through it. If it's, if it's for 15 minutes, if you're stood there and you're just talking like, you know, excuse the word, but bullshit. Like, are you allowed to swear on this? Yeah. Bullshit. If you just stand there for 15 minutes and talk absolute bollocks, the audience are going to see right through you. Yeah. And that's why it was so important for Rachel to make sure that what we wrote, was genuine and was something that we could relate to. And that's, I think one of the, you know, the, the, the key highlights of the show, I think is just the amount of honesty that there is there. And I will admit it is, it is heightened at certain bits, but that's just for dramatic effect. And I mean, as for it to be like a play, like you're not going to just be stood there the whole time, you know, it's just very monotone, very boring. You have to heighten it just a bit to create an atmosphere. When we were writing, we were sort of coming back week on week with like a little bit of, a bit more of it that changed. And I kept, we kept, I know me and Billy talked about this a lot. I kept just getting really annoyed because every week I'd come back and Rachel would just be like, give me more, go deeper. This is still on the surface. I want to know more. And it took, I think it took me about two months before I finally got somewhere. And she was like, that's it. You've got there. It's amazing to talk about. And I just, like I said this already, but the fact that we've done that with Rachel, now like a relative of mine, she's so close to her. And I'm glad I've done it because, you know, it just feels like the natural progression. I've worked with Rachel since I was maybe 12 now and I'm 18 now. So it's, it's been a long time. And this show feels like the cherry on top, like the natural progression. And again, what we want to do for this show as well is we want it to feel like, you know, as part of the TV workshop, we have a younger group, a middle group. And then we have this members are like four and the oldest are what? 18 or something. 23. So as you can imagine, you start off doing these plays and then you do short films and we want Edinburgh Fringe and going to the Edinburgh to be like the, you know, the height, like the neck, like almost like, not the graduation, but you know, like the pinnacle of what, what we do at TV workshop. So where are we are setting like the preset for them? Yeah. Rachel wanted us to sort of learn how to function as our own theatre company and not just have her organising everything. It's wonderful as she is at organising everything. To get that experience is just incredibly valuable. We've been doing marketing. Yeah. Fundraising, all sorts. It's, it's really, really exciting. Yeah. And luckily with, with Rachel, we have like all these connections that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Like in terms of Edinburgh, like she knows the guy that like, the space, the space you get. Yeah, the thing with Edinburgh is we literally were just sat there after lunch and we were like, we're taking this to Edinburgh. Yeah, so anyone would have been to Edinburgh. And then Rachel's face just lit up like, I know someone, I've done this before. And we were all just like, oh my God, guys, we're going to Edinburgh. So it's like, oh, this is to Edinburgh Fringe, wasn't it? Yeah. It was in like a day. We were like, okay, Edinburgh Fringe. Okay, we'll go. We'll just go for it and do it. We filmed the guy up and we was like, okay, we'll pay you tomorrow. But no, we have to, we have to say it was really expensive. So I'm really, the TV workshop is such a beautiful community because we're also supportive of each other. The parents are, it's a charity as well. So the parents have been like donating and we've been doing fundraisers and social media and people have been just like, you know, like trying to get involved and engaging with us. And it's just really, it's just amazing to see really. Yeah. My final like feminist related question is, Vagina Monologues came out like 21 years ago. 21 years. We mentioned this earlier, but it's like an entirely different generation of women and men. Yeah, it was before all of us were born. Yeah. Little do you know, I'm 21. Do you think we talk about sexuality differently? Well, I'm not even your generation, that makes me sad. I always think I'm like 16. We talk about sexuality differently because of things I think like social media. Like I said, like I overshare everything. Like I'm really open about my sexuality. That's crazy because I do, I do think though, like, you know, when you think of the 60s and stuff and swinging 60s and I just, I remember growing up and learning about that. I just, I just assumed that like after the 50s, that was like a turning point in history and specifically in England. Well, I wouldn't know anywhere else, but like in England, that was the turning point. And since then, everyone's just been like very open about sex, you know, like things, films like Alfie, you know, is that the right film? Yeah. Like, I feel like it was like a change in culture. But although despite that, that it's the act, like the actual discussion side, like, because people were doing it, we were having sex, but talking about it, the discussion side and actually making it like being aware of what we're actually doing. That was what wasn't changing. I think. Yeah, education. It's really interesting that you brought up the 60s because I did actually just remember a conversation that me and my mum had when we were talking about the show, which was, she just said like, oh, you can talk about sex. Couldn't even say the word vagina in my house when you were growing up. Like, it just wasn't done. You wouldn't bring it up. Like, if you were on your period, you wouldn't mention it. Nothing. And then, so she was just like, I think it's great. I think it's great that you can, you guys can do this and talk about it. Vagina! Vagina! The thing with sex, like, as regards sexuality, like, are you gay? Are you bi? Are you straight? Or whatever else. I think that, I don't know, it's become more of a, I don't know, it kind of blocks people off nowadays. I mean, we go about and say, like, you can, you can be free, you can have what you want, you can have what relationship you want, gay marriage and all this. But you still get asked, like, what you are. I mean, exactly. But I'll tell you why that is, though. I do think that is because, as of recently, you know, in the last decade or whatever, and this has been this change in this generation, because it's all happened all at once, it is, for some people, a bit overwhelming. But I think naturally, over the next couple of years, because it's becoming more natural and people, not becoming more natural, but it's people are learning more about it, people are like, okay, like, that it's almost been, like, a lesson for everyone. And people now fully understand what's going on. Well, like, you know, are starting to understand. It's acceptable. And then over the, for example, in, say, 2015 or whatever, I feel like by that point, that's when people are like, okay, we understand it now. And it won't be so, like, there wouldn't be that negative connotations with all those words. And, you know, especially when you see on Facebook, like, there's a hundred, is it like a hundred genders or, like, all these things. Yeah, it's like, it's very fluid and non-binary and things like that. Lots of negative connotations. But I'd like to think that in a couple of years, when people are fully understanding that and sort of taking that in, that that no longer exists. I mean, I go to school and I mean, people walk past, not to me, but to other people, like, oh, you're gay, or what you're doing, you're dying. Not to me, but, you know, to other people. And it's like, it still has that harshness and the rudeness. Yeah, that's what it would mean, like, gay is, like, gay is bad. So if I call you gay, you are bad. They just, it kind of think for some kids have come just like a word that comes naturally, like, oh, you're a pisser. It's gay. And he'll call, he'll, like, if I do something that he doesn't like, he's like, oh, that's gay. But he just, I think he's trying to, like, take it back. Yeah. Because he's like, it's fine, I can say that. Take ownership of it, yeah. Because I am gay. It's weird. I don't know. So, when, can you tell me, do you know where it is in Edinburgh yet? It's the Royal Mile. The space on the Royal Mile. And that's what it's called, the space. The space, yeah. And you're there the whole of? No, we're there from. From the 4th to the 12th of August, but we're not doing it on the 6th. And that's when we'll be out and about. Dressed as the Spice Girls. So if you see, if you see a guy dressed as Mel B and a bunch of girls dressed as Spice Girls, we want you to come and say hi to us and, like, enjoy Edinburgh together. And if you see a girl in a really small dress in a really cold Scotland, that's me as Posh Spice, I'm not being really stupid about it. And where can people find, like, the TV workshop to find out a bit more about that? Okay, social media. Yes. Okay, so the hashtag, for the show is TVWSHonestly, and that's on Twitter, and I think on Facebook as well. So if you search that, hopefully everything should come up. TV Workshop is just at TV Workshop Salford. And Facebook as Television Workshop Salford. We've also got an Indiegogo page to raise funds, and there's lots of exciting merchandise and stuff. Yeah, you can, so it's not just, we're not saying, oh, please give us some money. It's like, oh, if you give us five pounds, you can get, like, a picture of us, get some duff, get a nice little canvas bag. Yeah, we did, like, a photo shoot with, we did a photo shoot with Timeless Photography. Yeah, Alan's, he's a brilliant, he's actually just won an award for photography as well, so we're like, yeah, we've got, like, a world-winning photographer taking our pictures. He's great, he's great, and it's, like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Thank you so much. Thank you for having us.
