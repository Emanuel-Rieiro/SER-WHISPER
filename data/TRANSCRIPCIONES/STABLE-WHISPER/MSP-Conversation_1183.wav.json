{"text": " And I just wanted to ask you guys a few questions. First of all, does it seem like women are not interested in gaming at all, or it just doesn't appeal to them? I'd say both for the most part. It's really rare to find a girl that actually likes video games. And I found three. And is actually, like, social, like us three lovely ladies. Yeah, it's really rare. It's about as rare as finding, like, you know, a Mew in Pokemon. You know, just to use that reference. I think the fact that we only have four girls in our game major, Cody, I think that's a good point to make. Yeah, that's a really good point. But why is it that girls, is it really that girls aren't interested in video games, or, like, what is it that doesn't interest you? I think girls are attracted more by stupider things. And they haven't experienced the true video gaming-like thing. If they ever played Katamari, they would love video games. Everyone loves Katamari. It's why they named the game, because they love Katamari. I think it's not as big as in the first-person shooter, which are a lot of the guy, very popular games. Like, I play Left 4 Dead, which is about it. And a lot of, like, the games, like, a lot of people, like, I know some girls who play Call of Duty, but I know, like, 50 bazillion more guys that play Call of Duty more than girls. And I know, like, a lot of the more popular games that are out now are more based for guys than they are for girls. That's a very good point. Yeah, I think there are a lot of girls, though, that actually do play video games, and that it's just kind of, like, a cliche to think that girls don't play. Because I know a lot of my friends play video games. That's true. But we have a lot of cool friends, though, you know? Not everyone's as cool as us. I don't know, I think, like, most girls see video games as, like, something that they sit around and watch their boyfriend play. Like, oh, yeah, I went to his house and watched him play, like, Halo. It was great. Like, I don't know, like, that's, like, their end of, like, video gaming experience, which I don't understand because there's, like, such a wide variety of video games that they could find something, like, even, like, DDR, like, one of the girliest video games besides, like, Cooking Mama. Like, one of my friends. I don't know, they couldn't do anything. Well, to the point of Halo, I actually have a friend who, uh, her boyfriend was having a LAN party, so she actually came over to my house and started playing Halo. That's awesome. Although, I, I, not, I kicked her ass. I'm so sad for the girls who sit around and wait for their boyfriends to, like, play video games, though, because even though I am a gamer girl, I have sat there for hours while, like, my boyfriend plays, like, an addiction to some game where he just stops, looted the computer screen, acknowledged it to make this every 15 minutes, but he's just, like, playing a game, and I'm like, okay. Yeah, and you know what? That's happened to me before, and it pisses me off more that they don't offer me to play than that they're not paying attention to me. Babe. I'm like, I don't care. You have to pay attention to me. Just let me play your game. Cutscene. Okay, back to gaming. Um. Like, when Left 4 Dead came out, I didn't have Left 4 Dead, or allowed to play Left 4 Dead on, and he's sitting there playing Left 4 Dead for, like, 12 hours straight, and all of a sudden they're like, what if I want to play? Yeah. I would've been there. Um, are, do you think women are attracted to casual gaming? Um. Casual gaming? Yeah, like, like, PopCap's a great example. Puzzle games, uh. Like Sudoku? Uh, yeah, I guess you can say that. I was thinking more, like, Bejeweled and stuff. I don't know. I think it's getting more popular because, like, they're making, like, really weird, the games. Like, I don't know. I saw one commercial that was, like, learn how to cook through, like, a game on, like, your, I don't know, your Game Boy or something. I saw that. And I'm like, what is this? Like, I don't know. I think that's kind of weird, but I think girls would be more attracted to casual gaming, like, the more they, they make more diverse games, I guess. Yeah, that's very true. That's very true. Um, do women feel like gaming makes them unsocial and feel like they have no life? Because I know a lot of people, people say gamers are unsocial, have no life. So. It depends on what game you're playing. That's very true. Yeah. It's true. I mean, I played WoW, so, uh. I played WoW for about 25 minutes and I was like, no, not. That's, uh, that's enough, enough said. But, um. Yeah. Yeah, but you can't have them all, like, wow, you kind of. Yeah, that is a social thing. That's a very social thing. You can't, like, well, you could be able to play WoW. Like, social in the way that you sit there and you talk to people through a headset, but not social in the way that, like, you go and talk to girls and they freak out. I don't know. That's not true. I know a lot of cool people play WoW, like myself. Yes. I'm sorry, but when we talk about unsocial and WoW, that makes me think of that South Park episode that was all on a WoW server and the guy who was owning everyone was just this fat ass sitting on his couch, which is. If anyone has never seen that episode. Go, go see it. It's stereotypical, but at the same time, like, you know, there's a dude out there that's totally, like, just sitting there. Yeah, exactly. Like, on a couch. Yeah. And if you haven't seen the episode, go watch it. I'm afraid to go outside, too. That's very true. Afraid to go outside. But if you haven't seen that South Park episode, you should go watch it because the entire thing takes place on a WoW server. It's done. It burns. I'm sitting next to an albino right now. It's not me. I'm not there. What? Okay. I know there's been a lot of appeal over colors and how colors are coming to the Wii. Colors? Yes. Like, they have the black console. They got more diversity. And I know with the GameCube, they had multiple different colors of controllers. Why not just buy the white one and spray paint it? That's actually not a bad idea. People are so lazy. Gamers are so lazy. But do you think, like, their choice of colors, like, I know, especially in the GameCube, you could probably get, like. I want a pink one. Yeah, exactly. Like, a pink GameCube controller. You can get blue ones. You can get black ones. Do you think color appeals to women or it just really doesn't matter? If one comes over Hello Kitty, I know somebody who'd buy it. I don't know. It's kind of hard for me to relate to other women. That's very true. So I can't really answer for them. Plus, you own a PS2, which is black. Yeah, well, you know, it's my favorite color anyways, so. I think it could have some marketable, like, background. It's good for women, but unless there's, like, actually things that they're going to actually do on the Wii that they have, like, pink or purple or whatever the hell color they like, I don't think it would make much of a difference if they don't have a game to play. Unless they really want to play games that are oriented for women, like Cooking Mama and Horses and My Little Pony. Yeah, making sandwiches. What's up? Yeah. Make a game for ironing and raising children. Okay, well, two. No, it'd be, like, Housewives. Wii. It'd be so, it'd be ridiculous. That'd be pretty funny. I don't know. I don't know about colors, but if you added a hair straightener onto a remote, then girls would love it. They'll love it. I should work there. Or the new Project Batal. Let's make a girl and make it as all dressed and pretty. Yeah. That was pretty ridiculous. What if you had an accessory that was the Wii remote stuck into a baby that was, like, self-urinating? When working for it. I have no response to that. What was that? What was that, Liz? Oh, I said I have no response to that. It would probably be used for, like, sexual education, where they're like, learn how to take care of a baby, instead of, like, keeping, like, the key in the back for, like, two weeks. Yeah. That would be helpful to the human race. CPR course with the Wii. How ridiculous is that? You know, I wouldn't be surprised. They have really ridiculous things. Like, losing weight with video games? I'm like, no, it's video games. Like, you're supposed to sit on your ass and, like, eat potato chips. Like, you don't lose weight with video games. How do you practice? They actually, they have, like, a dummy, and you put the Wii remote on top of it. So why do you need the Wii remote for? That's a very good point. Just take the f***ing dummy and just be like, CPR! Let's, like, not make ourselves lazy and have, like, a Wii remote. Like, what would it tell you? Like, unless you had, like, a sensor thing in it, it would be like, oh, god, you're pressing too hard. Oh, my god, you broke the collarbone! Oh, my god, they're dying! We didn't do enough chest pumps! Do you guys think women are discouraged from gaming because of the way video game heroines are made sexy to appeal to men? Especially when... You mean, like, Dead or Alive 4? What was that? You mean, like, Dead or Alive 4? I was speaking... I never actually played Dead or Alive. I was thinking of Laura Croft, mostly. Oh, well, I mean, like, Laura Croft. You went on to play a sexy girl. I mean, come on. Yeah, well, I mean... I mean, if you're a sexy lady, you want to play a sexy lady. So, I mean, come on. Yeah, but, I mean... You want to be that hot chick over there that everyone's staring at, yeah. You want to be Taki just dumping around a scene on Soul Calibur. Jesus Christ. Has anyone else noticed that, like, for the Soul Calibur games, like, the newer ones they make, like, the groups keep getting bigger and bigger, and the clothing just keeps getting less and less? I wonder when they're going to fall over. Yeah. I mean, I swear, by the fifth one, they're going to be falling over, and they're just going to be naked. Or they're going to be, like, in a little spider hole in their back, like, oh my god, my back kills! Yeah. I can't... They just, like, get killed themselves because, like, their back just breaks in half. Oh, that was easy. What a terrible fighting game. You don't have to punch them, they just die. Yeah, I know. So you punch them, and they're moved back as, like, a defense, like an airbag, so they don't even get hurt. Wow. I never thought of that. That's what you call a strong defense.

wanted to ask you guys a few questions. First of all, does it seem like women are not interested in gaming at all, or it just doesn't appeal to them? I'd say both for the most part. It's really rare to find a girl that actually likes video games. And I found three. And is actually, like, social, like us three lovely ladies. Yeah, it's really rare. It's about as rare as finding, like, you know, a Mew in Pokemon. You know, just to use that reference. I think the fact that we only have four girls in our game major, Cody, I think that's a good point to make. Yeah, that's a really good point. But why is it that girls, is it really that girls aren't interested in video games, or, like, what is it that doesn't interest you? I think girls are attracted more by stupider things. And they haven't experienced the true video gaming-like thing. If they ever played Katamari, they would love video games. Everyone loves Katamari. It's why they named the game, because they love Katamari. I think it's not as big as in the first-person shooter, which are a lot of the guy, very popular games. Like, I play Left 4 Dead, which is about it. And a lot of, like, the games, like, a lot of people, like, I know some girls who play Call of Duty, but I know, like, 50 bazillion more guys that play Call of Duty more than girls. And I know, like, a lot of the more popular games that are out now are more based for guys than they are for girls. That's a very good point. Yeah, I think there are a lot of girls, though, that actually do play video games, and that it's just kind of, like, a cliche to think that girls don't play. Because I know a lot of my friends play video games. That's true. But we have a lot of cool friends, though, you know? Not everyone's as cool as us. I don't know, I think, like, most girls see video games as, like, something that they sit around and watch their boyfriend play. Like, oh, yeah, I went to his house and watched him play, like, Halo. It was great. Like, I don't know, like, that's, like, their end of, like, video gaming experience, which I don't understand because there's, like, such a wide variety of video games that they could find something, like, even, like, DDR, like, one of the girliest video games besides, like, Cooking Mama. Like, one of my friends. I don't know, they couldn't do anything. Well, to the point of Halo, I actually have a friend who, uh, her boyfriend was having a LAN party, so she actually came over to my house and started playing Halo. That's awesome. Although, I, I, not, I kicked her ass. I'm so sad for the girls who sit around and wait for their boyfriends to, like, play video games, though, because even though I am a gamer girl, I have sat there for hours while, like, my boyfriend plays, like, an addiction to some game where he just stops, looted the computer screen, acknowledged it to make this every 15 minutes, but he's just, like, playing a game, and I'm like, okay. Yeah, and you know what? That's happened to me before, and it pisses me off more that they don't offer me to play than that they're not paying attention to me. Babe. I'm like, I don't care. You have to pay attention to me. Just let me play your game. Cutscene. Okay, back to gaming. Um. Like, when Left 4 Dead came out, I didn't have Left 4 Dead, or allowed to play Left 4 Dead on, and he's sitting there playing Left 4 Dead for, like, 12 hours straight, and all of a sudden they're like, what if I want to play? Yeah. I would've been there. Um, are, do you think women are attracted to casual gaming? Um. Casual gaming? Yeah, like, like, PopCap's a great example. Puzzle games, uh. Like Sudoku? Uh, yeah, I guess you can say that. I was thinking more, like, Bejeweled and stuff. I don't know. I think it's getting more popular because, like, they're making, like, really weird, the games. Like, I don't know. I saw one commercial that was, like, learn how to cook through, like, a game on, like, your, I don't know, your Game Boy or something. I saw that. And I'm like, what is this? Like, I don't know. I think that's kind of weird, but I think girls would be more attracted to casual gaming, like, the more they, they make more diverse games, I guess. Yeah, that's very true. That's very true. Um, do women feel like gaming makes them unsocial and feel like they have no life? Because I know a lot of people, people say gamers are unsocial, have no life. So. It depends on what game you're playing. That's very true. Yeah. It's true. I mean, I played WoW, so, uh. I played WoW for about 25 minutes and I was like, no, not. That's, uh, that's enough, enough said. But, um. Yeah. Yeah, but you can't have them all, like, wow, you kind of. Yeah, that is a social thing. That's a very social thing. You can't, like, well, you could be able to play WoW. Like, social in the way that you sit there and you talk to people through a headset, but not social in the way that, like, you go and talk to girls and they freak out. I don't know. That's not true. I know a lot of cool people play WoW, like myself. Yes. I'm sorry, but when we talk about unsocial and WoW, that makes me think of that South Park episode that was all on a WoW server and the guy who was owning everyone was just this fat ass sitting on his couch, which is. If anyone has never seen that episode. Go, go see it. It's stereotypical, but at the same time, like, you know, there's a dude out there that's totally, like, just sitting there. Yeah, exactly. Like, on a couch. Yeah. And if you haven't seen the episode, go watch it. I'm afraid to go outside, too. That's very true. Afraid to go outside. But if you haven't seen that South Park episode, you should go watch it because the entire thing takes place on a WoW server. It's done. It burns. I'm sitting next to an albino right now. It's not me. I'm not there. What? Okay. I know there's been a lot of appeal over colors and how colors are coming to the Wii. Colors? Yes. Like, they have the black console. They got more diversity. And I know with the GameCube, they had multiple different colors of controllers. Why not just buy the white one and spray paint it? That's actually not a bad idea. People are so lazy. Gamers are so lazy. But do you think, like, their choice of colors, like, I know, especially in the GameCube, you could probably get, like. I want a pink one. Yeah, exactly. Like, a pink GameCube controller. You can get blue ones. You can get black ones. Do you think color appeals to women or it just really doesn't matter? If one comes over Hello Kitty, I know somebody who'd buy it. I don't know. It's kind of hard for me to relate to other women. That's very true. So I can't really answer for them. Plus, you own a PS2, which is black. Yeah, well, you know, it's my favorite color anyways, so. I think it could have some marketable, like, background. It's good for women, but unless there's, like, actually things that they're going to actually do on the Wii that they have, like, pink or purple or whatever the hell color they like, I don't think it would make much of a difference if they don't have a game to play. Unless they really want to play games that are oriented for women, like Cooking Mama and Horses and My Little Pony. Yeah, making sandwiches. What's up? Yeah. Make a game for ironing and raising children. Okay, well, two. No, it'd be, like, Housewives. Wii. It'd be so, it'd be ridiculous. That'd be pretty funny. I don't know. I don't know about colors, but if you added a hair straightener onto a remote, then girls would love it. They'll love it. I should work there. Or the new Project Batal. Let's make a girl and make it as all dressed and pretty. Yeah. That was pretty ridiculous. What if you had an accessory that was the Wii remote stuck into a baby that was, like, self-urinating? When working for it. I have no response to that. What was that? What was that, Liz? Oh, I said I have no response to that. It would probably be used for, like, sexual education, where they're like, learn how to take care of a baby, instead of, like, keeping, like, the key in the back for, like, two weeks. Yeah. That would be helpful to the human race. CPR course with the Wii. How ridiculous is that? You know, I wouldn't be surprised. They have really ridiculous things. Like, losing weight with video games? I'm like, no, it's video games. Like, you're supposed to sit on your ass and, like, eat potato chips. Like, you don't lose weight with video games. How do you practice? They actually, they have, like, a dummy, and you put the Wii remote on top of it. So why do you need the Wii remote for? That's a very good point. Just take the f***ing dummy and just be like, CPR! Let's, like, not make ourselves lazy and have, like, a Wii remote. Like, what would it tell you? Like, unless you had, like, a sensor thing in it, it would be like, oh, god, you're pressing too hard. Oh, my god, you broke the collarbone! Oh, my god, they're dying! We didn't do enough chest pumps! Do you guys think women are discouraged from gaming because of the way video game heroines are made sexy to appeal to men? Especially when... You mean, like, Dead or Alive 4? What was that? You mean, like, Dead or Alive 4? I was speaking... I never actually played Dead or Alive. I was thinking of Laura Croft, mostly. Oh, well, I mean, like, Laura Croft. You went on to play a sexy girl. I mean, come on. Yeah, well, I mean... I mean, if you're a sexy lady, you want to play a sexy lady. So, I mean, come on. Yeah, but, I mean... You want to be that hot chick over there that everyone's staring at, yeah. You want to be Taki just dumping around a scene on Soul Calibur. Jesus Christ. Has anyone else noticed that, like, for the Soul Calibur games, like, the newer ones they make, like, the groups keep getting bigger and bigger, and the clothing just keeps getting less and less? I wonder when they're going to fall over. Yeah. I mean, I swear, by the fifth one, they're going to be falling over, and they're just going to be naked. Or they're going to be, like, in a little spider hole in their back, like, oh my god, my back kills! Yeah. I can't... They just, like, get killed themselves because, like, their back just breaks in half. Oh, that was easy. What a terrible fighting game. You don't have to punch them, they just die. Yeah, I know. So you punch them, and they're moved back as, like, a defense, like an airbag, so they don't even get hurt. Wow. I never thought of that. That's what you call a strong defense.
