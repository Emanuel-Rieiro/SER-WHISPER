{"text": " than it is different from a random man's personality, perhaps. Especially from, like, a man. Like, if you did have a brother, maybe your personality would be more similar to his than it would be to another random woman's. But maybe not, because maybe your parents really did treat you differently. But, like, yeah, you most likely are... You're likely to have more similarities between people who, like, went to your same elementary school, grew up in your same town, and are your same age than you are to have from, like, a woman in India, you know? Like, we're all going to have different personalities from all the women across the world. Yeah, so something that we kind of all agree on is that personalities really creates a person and creates the differences between people. Yeah. Not gender, biologically. But what's something that interesting that Bella brought up is, like, you know, so we all agree that it's not inherent, but Bella also brings up the point, well, who's to say that being emotional is negative? Like, so, yeah, we can make the argument that women aren't inherently more emotional than men. But let's say that they are acting more emotional because of socialization. And we want to talk about why it has to be a negative thing. Well, that's what I was kind of getting at with asking why. And then we did, you know, discuss it furthers oppression. But, yeah, it's like, who does it serve? And I think that it has to be negative because that serves a purpose, you know? And that purpose is to be like, okay, well, you're not doing this right. And I think, you know, maybe to, instead of using such broad terms as oppression or anything, maybe we can talk about our own lives. Because I've seen this happen, you know, in my own life. If I'm pissed at something, you know, my boyfriend is done, or maybe even just a guy, he can go to his friends and be like, man, she was talking some shit, you know? Like, she did not know what she was talking about. She was being overly sensitive. She was being a crazy lady. She was being a crazy bitch. She was being overly sensitive. And that serves a purpose to, you know, not really... Well, it delegitimizes and devalues. That's what I was going to say. It minimizes. It takes the issue out of the equation. It takes our voice away. And it puts it all on you. It takes our voice away. So I think that that really does serve a purpose, and that's why it's seen as negative. Remember that thing that... This is, like, interesting because it's not even a boyfriend or, like, a family member, but remember that thing that happened to you, Claire, when that... that your, like, zip... your Zim rider was late? Yeah, I was doing a carpool situation off this rideshare website. And anyway, it's... I am paying this person a decent amount of money to give me a ride somewhere, so you expect when you're paying someone to... they're going to fulfill that promise. The service that you purchased. Yeah. And so we had agreed on a time. It was 2 p.m. And then he texted me at, like, 1.55, and he was like, oh, actually, I'm not going to be there. How about I pick you up at 3 p.m.? And I was like, you know, that's just not okay. We had an agreement, and I want you to uphold your part of the agreement, just like I'm going to uphold mine of being ready at 2 p.m. and having my cash on hand. Yeah. And so... And then he was like, oh, well, actually, I want to take a nap. And I was like, oh, my God. You know? Not even a good reason. Not even a good reason. You know, maybe I would have been understanding if it was like, well, actually, I really can't get there. I would have been, like, still annoyed because you're still not upholding your part of the agreement, but it was not even an understandable reason. And anyway, then when he got there to my house at 3 p.m. an hour late, I was ready to let it go because I was just getting in the car with this person. I wasn't going to talk about it, really. But he just goes, oh, so you're really pissed, huh? And I'm like, yeah, yes, I was upset. Yeah. You know, I'm not going to lie to your face. It takes away any accountability that he has for the situation. Yeah. I was going to say. He's putting it all on you. It's like, no, what's happening here is that you're late and I just reacted to it. Yeah. I just called you out for not, yeah, not doing your job. And it's like, if it had been the other way around, I bet that I would have been like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's like, he was being so defensive. So, like, you are out of line and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. When he was clearly the out of line one. I mean, I would surmise that if you had been a guy, you would have been like, oh, sorry, dude. Sorry, man. Yeah. I mean, you know. Yeah. I remember, too, when I had, I had an ex-partner who used to say to me, like, oh, are you cranky with me? I was like, fuck you. Cranky describes someone who's just in a bad mood for no legitimate reason who's just cranky. Yeah. It's like, that's another way to, like, delegitimize someone's feelings. Yeah. It's childlike. Yeah. I'm cranky. You're mean to me. It's like, no, you're a dick. I'm mad for a reason. Yeah. And it's just a way to minimize, once again, like, women's emotions, women's feelings, and just disregard them as, oh, women. Well, we can also obviously point out how many, it's probably been said to us many times that maybe you and a partner would say, are you on your period? Or, like, are you PMSing? Yeah. Like, especially, has this ever happened to you where you're kind of, like, in the middle of a fight or something? And they'll be like, oh, is it that time of the month? No, it's never happened to me. It's never happened to me. I would lose my shit. It's really rude. Oh, it's happened to me? Oh, my God. I just thought of the way, the time that it happened to me. We were all traveling for work. This was my coworker who said this to me. Oh, you're not serious. I'm serious. And we were traveling for work, and we were, it was a late Sunday night. Like, no one wants to be traveling for work on a late Sunday night. We get to the house, and I was mad because, you know, I think that we had become really late, and one of the guys wanted to stop and get food or something, but I was like, I just really want to go home. We have to get up early to work tomorrow. And then when we got back, I was just kind of obviously in a bad mood. But I wasn't saying anything to any, I wasn't mean to any of them, you know. I'm sure. You're minding your own business. Yeah, I was minding my own business. I was just not in a happy mood, which I was okay with. First of all, it's a Sunday night, and I don't need to be, like, working. But anyway, I'm just kidding. You need to be, like, jolly. Yeah. In hot water. Then you want some lemon water. I'm always happy because, you know. Yeah. And then one of the guys, we're sitting around the table, and he says, Erin, are you on your period? And you should have seen my face, you guys. It was literally steam was coming out of the top of my head. I was so mad. Fire from your nostrils. Fire. It's just ridiculous. And then it becomes hard to, like, then it becomes hard to talk about, like, your period in a way. Because it's like, no, that's not the reason. But it's like, you also want to be able to talk about your period and the uncomfortable times that your period has sometimes. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, don't delegitimize. I don't know. Do you guys know what I mean, though? But then that's, like, scary because then when guys like that, like, say to you, are you on your period? And it's like, and they obviously are, like, very misogynistic and being like, women are crazy. Their periods make them these crazy monsters. Yeah. It's like, it becomes complicated and difficult when that actually does make some women feel... Or just increase... Am I being... Yeah, like, and by the way, I was not on my period when this guy asked me. Yeah, so in that case, it's fully rude. And my response was, I was just fuming red, and I was like, why? Yeah. Like, why do you say so? Yeah. And he was like, oh, I don't know, just wondering. Oh, just wondering. J-dubs? Okay. I'm so bad. Do you stick up your butt? Oh, my God. Just really, like, how big is that? Are there thorns? Yeah. Oh, my God. But I think that, like, I actually do feel that sometimes about two days of the month, I feel slightly more down or a little bit more emotional than the other days, but also I kind of, like, keep a record of... I have this thing where, like, I keep data on my daily days, but it's possible that you may not notice it, but I think that for me, like, I would be very... I would be very upset even if someone did... If they're trying to guess whether or not I'm on my period based on my emotions, because that's really, really not fair. It's, like, delegitimizing your emotions and, like, what we're talking about. But you can... You should definitely be able to bring it up and say, like, I might be feeling this way because of this, but no one should ever try to, like, guess what your emotions are. Yeah, it's also just a way of not... Again, like, we're saying, like, the are you pissed thing. It's, like, just a way of not taking accountability for, like... For why you might be, like... Yeah. It's about listening. Like, let's say you are in a bad mood for a reason or you're in a bad mood because you are experiencing some PMS symptoms. Yeah. For them to assume before you're able to explain, like, let's say you're close with this person and you do want to tell him the reason, they need to listen and wait so that they can figure out why you're upset. Like, it would be rude. Like, yeah, like, it would be... Like, sometimes maybe if you have a cold, you would be really wanting to get home because you're sick. And, like, you are maybe being more cranky because you're sick. Or if you're really hungry is a good cranky. Yeah, you're really hungry, but it's, like, you still don't want someone being, like... Especially your co-worker. Yeah, you don't want your co-worker, like, or somebody when, like, they're late or, like, your partner if they maybe, like, did something, you know, said something that made you feel bad. Like, you don't want someone being, like, oh, you're just... you're just... it's just because you're cold. Yeah. Because it's, like, no, maybe I could be, like, I'm sick, I'm not at my best, so I'm gonna say that that's what's making me feel bad, but I don't want you to say it for me. Yeah. You know, like, that's maybe the biggest issue.

"ori_dict": {"text": " than it is different from a random man's personality, perhaps. Especially from, like, a man. Like, if you did have a brother, maybe your personality would be more similar to his than it would be to another random woman's. But maybe not, because maybe your parents really did treat you differently. But, like, yeah, you most likely are... You're likely to have more similarities between people who, like, went to your same elementary school, grew up in your same town, and are your same age than you are to have from, like, a woman in India, you know? Like, we're all going to have different personalities from all the women across the world. Yeah, so something that we kind of all agree on is that personalities really creates a person and creates the differences between people. Yeah. Not gender, biologically. But what's something that interesting that Bella brought up is, like, you know, so we all agree that it's not inherent, but Bella also brings up the point, well, who's to say that being emotional is negative? Like, so, yeah, we can make the argument that women aren't inherently more emotional than men. But let's say that they are acting more emotional because of socialization. And we want to talk about why it has to be a negative thing. Well, that's what I was kind of getting at with asking why. And then we did, you know, discuss it furthers oppression. But, yeah, it's like, who does it serve? And I think that it has to be negative because that serves a purpose, you know? And that purpose is to be like, okay, well, you're not doing this right. And I think, you know, maybe to, instead of using such broad terms as oppression or anything, maybe we can talk about our own lives. Because I've seen this happen, you know, in my own life. If I'm pissed at something, you know, my boyfriend is done, or maybe even just a guy, he can go to his friends and be like, man, she was talking some shit, you know? Like, she did not know what she was talking about. She was being overly sensitive. She was being a crazy lady. She was being a crazy bitch. She was being overly sensitive. And that serves a purpose to, you know, not really... Well, it delegitimizes and devalues. That's what I was going to say. It minimizes. It takes the issue out of the equation. It takes our voice away. And it puts it all on you. It takes our voice away. So I think that that really does serve a purpose, and that's why it's seen as negative. Remember that thing that... This is, like, interesting because it's not even a boyfriend or, like, a family member, but remember that thing that happened to you, Claire, when that... that your, like, zip... your Zim rider was late? Yeah, I was doing a carpool situation off this rideshare website. And anyway, it's... I am paying this person a decent amount of money to give me a ride somewhere, so you expect when you're paying someone to... they're going to fulfill that promise. The service that you purchased. Yeah. And so we had agreed on a time. It was 2 p.m. And then he texted me at, like, 1.55, and he was like, oh, actually, I'm not going to be there. How about I pick you up at 3 p.m.? And I was like, you know, that's just not okay. We had an agreement, and I want you to uphold your part of the agreement, just like I'm going to uphold mine of being ready at 2 p.m. and having my cash on hand. Yeah. And so... And then he was like, oh, well, actually, I want to take a nap. And I was like, oh, my God. You know? Not even a good reason. Not even a good reason. You know, maybe I would have been understanding if it was like, well, actually, I really can't get there. I would have been, like, still annoyed because you're still not upholding your part of the agreement, but it was not even an understandable reason. And anyway, then when he got there to my house at 3 p.m. an hour late, I was ready to let it go because I was just getting in the car with this person. I wasn't going to talk about it, really. But he just goes, oh, so you're really pissed, huh? And I'm like, yeah, yes, I was upset. Yeah. You know, I'm not going to lie to your face. It takes away any accountability that he has for the situation. Yeah. I was going to say. He's putting it all on you. It's like, no, what's happening here is that you're late and I just reacted to it. Yeah. I just called you out for not, yeah, not doing your job. And it's like, if it had been the other way around, I bet that I would have been like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's like, he was being so defensive. So, like, you are out of line and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. When he was clearly the out of line one. I mean, I would surmise that if you had been a guy, you would have been like, oh, sorry, dude. Sorry, man. Yeah. I mean, you know. Yeah. I remember, too, when I had, I had an ex-partner who used to say to me, like, oh, are you cranky with me? I was like, fuck you. Cranky describes someone who's just in a bad mood for no legitimate reason who's just cranky. Yeah. It's like, that's another way to, like, delegitimize someone's feelings. Yeah. It's childlike. Yeah. I'm cranky. You're mean to me. It's like, no, you're a dick. I'm mad for a reason. Yeah. And it's just a way to minimize, once again, like, women's emotions, women's feelings, and just disregard them as, oh, women. Well, we can also obviously point out how many, it's probably been said to us many times that maybe you and a partner would say, are you on your period? Or, like, are you PMSing? Yeah. Like, especially, has this ever happened to you where you're kind of, like, in the middle of a fight or something? And they'll be like, oh, is it that time of the month? No, it's never happened to me. It's never happened to me. I would lose my shit. It's really rude. Oh, it's happened to me? Oh, my God. I just thought of the way, the time that it happened to me. We were all traveling for work. This was my coworker who said this to me. Oh, you're not serious. I'm serious. And we were traveling for work, and we were, it was a late Sunday night. Like, no one wants to be traveling for work on a late Sunday night. We get to the house, and I was mad because, you know, I think that we had become really late, and one of the guys wanted to stop and get food or something, but I was like, I just really want to go home. We have to get up early to work tomorrow. And then when we got back, I was just kind of obviously in a bad mood. But I wasn't saying anything to any, I wasn't mean to any of them, you know. I'm sure. You're minding your own business. Yeah, I was minding my own business. I was just not in a happy mood, which I was okay with. First of all, it's a Sunday night, and I don't need to be, like, working. But anyway, I'm just kidding. You need to be, like, jolly. Yeah. In hot water. Then you want some lemon water. I'm always happy because, you know. Yeah. And then one of the guys, we're sitting around the table, and he says, Erin, are you on your period? And you should have seen my face, you guys. It was literally steam was coming out of the top of my head. I was so mad. Fire from your nostrils. Fire. It's just ridiculous. And then it becomes hard to, like, then it becomes hard to talk about, like, your period in a way. Because it's like, no, that's not the reason. But it's like, you also want to be able to talk about your period and the uncomfortable times that your period has sometimes. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, don't delegitimize. I don't know. Do you guys know what I mean, though? But then that's, like, scary because then when guys like that, like, say to you, are you on your period? And it's like, and they obviously are, like, very misogynistic and being like, women are crazy. Their periods make them these crazy monsters. Yeah. It's like, it becomes complicated and difficult when that actually does make some women feel... Or just increase... Am I being... Yeah, like, and by the way, I was not on my period when this guy asked me. Yeah, so in that case, it's fully rude. And my response was, I was just fuming red, and I was like, why? Yeah. Like, why do you say so? Yeah. And he was like, oh, I don't know, just wondering. Oh, just wondering. J-dubs? Okay. I'm so bad. Do you stick up your butt? Oh, my God. Just really, like, how big is that? Are there thorns? Yeah. Oh, my God. But I think that, like, I actually do feel that sometimes about two days of the month, I feel slightly more down or a little bit more emotional than the other days, but also I kind of, like, keep a record of... I have this thing where, like, I keep data on my daily days, but it's possible that you may not notice it, but I think that for me, like, I would be very... I would be very upset even if someone did... If they're trying to guess whether or not I'm on my period based on my emotions, because that's really, really not fair. It's, like, delegitimizing your emotions and, like, what we're talking about. But you can... You should definitely be able to bring it up and say, like, I might be feeling this way because of this, but no one should ever try to, like, guess what your emotions are. Yeah, it's also just a way of not... Again, like, we're saying, like, the are you pissed thing. It's, like, just a way of not taking accountability for, like... For why you might be, like... Yeah. It's about listening. Like, let's say you are in a bad mood for a reason or you're in a bad mood because you are experiencing some PMS symptoms. Yeah. For them to assume before you're able to explain, like, let's say you're close with this person and you do want to tell him the reason, they need to listen and wait so that they can figure out why you're upset. Like, it would be rude. Like, yeah, like, it would be... Like, sometimes maybe if you have a cold, you would be really wanting to get home because you're sick. And, like, you are maybe being more cranky because you're sick. Or if you're really hungry is a good cranky. Yeah, you're really hungry, but it's, like, you still don't want someone being, like... Especially your co-worker. Yeah, you don't want your co-worker, like, or somebody when, like, they're late or, like, your partner if they maybe, like, did something, you know, said something that made you feel bad. Like, you don't want someone being, like, oh, you're just... you're just... it's just because you're cold. Yeah. Because it's, like, no, maybe I could be, like, I'm sick, I'm not at my best, so I'm gonna say that that's what's making me feel bad, but I don't want you to say it for me. Yeah. You know, like, that's maybe the biggest issue.
