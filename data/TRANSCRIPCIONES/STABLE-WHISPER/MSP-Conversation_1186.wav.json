{"text": " The existence of hydrates on the blow-off preventer and the capping stack is indicia that there is gas there because the gas combined with the cold water and the pressure is what produces hydrates. So there is some amount of methane gas in that. The exact percentage is we have taken samples, and they're being analyzed ashore. Some samples done on scene based on the samples were taken in around the wellhead indicated there was about 16% methane, but that needs to be validated by a shore test. During the July 21st press conference, we also asked Thad Allen to describe all of the leaks identified since the capping test and to talk about any new ones they've just discovered. Differences in density and return on both the seismic and the acoustic sensors, they were investigated with ROVs. They thought there might be some plumes or some gas bubbles, but when they were followed up with ROVs, there were no other indications observed, and we closed out on those. Following that, on the 19th is when we started to observe the bubbles around the current wellhead and the blowout preventer. Those have already been reported, and these are emanating from the wellhead itself through gaskets and seals that are having to be leaking. And finally, we found another leak just yesterday in the BOP on the annular preventer. That's the upper part of the BOP or the lower marine riser package, and that's attributed to a leak in a gasket as well. I think what you're generally starting to see is from the blowout preventer, it's been down there a long time under a lot of stress, and just like any other piece of equipment, we're starting to see some small leaks around it. But that's been it so far. Dr. Samantha Joy of the University of Georgia became prominent in the headlines after establishing new problems in the Gulf of Mexico, due to large plumes of oil and methane, posing a risk to oxygen levels in the water column. BP downplayed the results of her initial tests. Dr. Joy has persisted, though, in her research, and she points out that the type of specific testing she's been doing takes time and multiple analyses. She documents her research at gulfblog.uga.edu, and a documentary produced by the University of Georgia is airing this week through the Georgia Public Broadcast Network. On July 9th, we asked Dr. Samantha Joy to discuss unique problems related to the specific drill site of the Deepwater Horizon. The rig that would have produced a very large amount had it been operational now appears to be sitting on a large methane gas field, which poses further risk. Pressure from the capped well could put too much force on weak points, a known fissure identified along the pipeline, for example, and other locations at or near the BP rig.

existence of hydrates on the blow-off preventer and the capping stack is indicia that there is gas there because the gas combined with the cold water and the pressure is what produces hydrates. So there is some amount of methane gas in that. The exact percentage is we have taken samples, and they're being analyzed ashore. Some samples done on scene based on the samples were taken in around the wellhead indicated there was about 16% methane, but that needs to be validated by a shore test. During the July 21st press conference, we also asked Thad Allen to describe all of the leaks identified since the capping test and to talk about any new ones they've just discovered. Differences in density and return on both the seismic and the acoustic sensors, they were investigated with ROVs. They thought there might be some plumes or some gas bubbles, but when they were followed up with ROVs, there were no other indications observed, and we closed out on those. Following that, on the 19th is when we started to observe the bubbles around the current wellhead and the blowout preventer. Those have already been reported, and these are emanating from the wellhead itself through gaskets and seals that are having to be leaking. And finally, we found another leak just yesterday in the BOP on the annular preventer. That's the upper part of the BOP or the lower marine riser package, and that's attributed to a leak in a gasket as well. I think what you're generally starting to see is from the blowout preventer, it's been down there a long time under a lot of stress, and just like any other piece of equipment, we're starting to see some small leaks around it. But that's been it so far. Dr. Samantha Joy of the University of Georgia became prominent in the headlines after establishing new problems in the Gulf of Mexico, due to large plumes of oil and methane, posing a risk to oxygen levels in the water column. BP downplayed the results of her initial tests. Dr. Joy has persisted, though, in her research, and she points out that the type of specific testing she's been doing takes time and multiple analyses. She documents her research at gulfblog.uga.edu, and a documentary produced by the University of Georgia is airing this week through the Georgia Public Broadcast Network. On July 9th, we asked Dr. Samantha Joy to discuss unique problems related to the specific drill site of the Deepwater Horizon. The rig that would have produced a very large amount had it been operational now appears to be sitting on a large methane gas field, which poses further risk. Pressure from the capped well could put too much force on weak points, a known fissure identified along the pipeline, for example, and other locations at or near the BP rig.
