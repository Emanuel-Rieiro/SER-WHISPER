Ed, you're on Free Talk Live with Ian Julia and Mark. Ed in Tennessee. Ed in Tennessee going once. Is Ed's pot turned up? Ed in Tennessee going twice. I'm going to put Ed back on hold here for a moment. Maybe something went wrong with his cell phone or something like that. Or there's a technical difficulty. We'll try him again here in a little bit. 855-450-3733. So we're talking about a pretty scary drug. It's called desomorphine or the crocodile, known as crocodile in Russia, where it's become fairly popular because, well, it's a consequence of the war on drugs. They've cracked down on imports of Afghani drugs. It's a consequence of heroin. And as a result of that, since the heroin's not hitting the streets in the way that it was, somebody has come up with an alternative. As they always will. Right. Because people are demanding to get high. And so the market will supply that demand. Unfortunately, this particular alternative is rotting people's skin off. I think it's necessary to point out, too, that it's not just like your skin isn't turning black. Like it's literally falling off so that your bones are exposed like in a scary movie. I mean, it's awful. Right. You're not exaggerating. I mean, it's just just thinking back to the picture that I saw is just disgusting to me. Literally just no skin. I mean, I don't even understand how anyone can live like that. And apparently you don't live for very long. The article gave 18 months. Basically, once all of your skin falls off or enough of it falls off, you die. I mean, you can't you can't live without your skin. It's your biggest and most important organ. Skin. You're going to have all kind of nasty germs and disease and things like that getting in your body. Things are going to go poorly. Yeah. So this is terrible. And it's happening because of the war on drugs. In fact, you could say that methamphetamine never would have come about had it not been for the war on drugs. No, I would absolutely I would say crack is another one that probably wouldn't exist were it not for the war on drugs. Right. These are ways to, you know, the people sort of, you know, the drugs morphed because of the war on drugs. Crack, maybe not. It's hard. It's really hard to say. A lot of people have made really great arguments. People, people more studied and smarter than I have. I am have said that crack wouldn't exist. It does seem to some ways like a more efficient use of cocaine. I'm not sure entirely. But but doesn't crack wasn't crack created because cocaine is very expensive. Yep. And crack is a way cheaper high. I mean, you get more for your money, basically. It's a more efficient use of the cocaine that you have. Yeah. So it may very well have come about in that, you know, for that purpose. I'm not entirely sure. I wouldn't make the claim. Some people who know more about this stuff have that I do have claimed otherwise. And I'm not entirely certain. But what I can tell you is whatever is being done at this point isn't working. I think the people that support the war on drugs and they are out there, many of them work for the government. It's hard for them. It's hard for us to get them to call the show and actually have to. They don't have their opinion is already a fact. So they don't have to express it. I think the people that support the war on drugs should really come out with how they really feel. Because, please, don't give me this crap that you want people to stop doing drugs because it's good for them. Because that would suggest you actually give a damn about those people. And if you actually gave a damn about human beings who are using drugs or addicted to drugs, because not all drug users are addicted. But if you actually gave a damn about people who are using drugs, especially the ones that are addicted to them, then you would be advocating for the end of the war on drugs. Because you would understand what we've been saying here for years on this show. This is not this is not new. Drug and its knowledge about it may be new, but this is an old process of whenever prohibition happens, go back to alcohol. Alcohol prohibition that prohibited beer. And all of a sudden, hard liquor came about as a result of that. Hard liquor existed, but bootlegging was very dangerous. And a lot of people died. Well, it became very popular. Hard liquor, the use of the transport of hard liquor became very popular. The consumption of hard liquor, because it's easier to transport liquor than it is beer. Beer has more water in it. Dollar for dollar, you're going to make more transporting a truckload of hard liquor. Liquor became more popular as a result. And in fact, it has, I think now just as a percentage of consumption, it still hasn't gotten all the way back down to what it was pre-prohibition. So essentially what prohibition did to some extent, you know, one of the things that prohibition did, I shouldn't say essentially, one of the things that prohibition did was increase the amount of liquor consumed as a percentage of alcohol consumption. Right. And similarly, it increased, it created crack cocaine, it created methamphetamine, it created these difficult, dangerous situations in which they're manufactured and distributed. I think it's important to point out that it didn't exactly create methamphetamine, but it did create methamphetamine as we know it today. Methamphetamine was actually originally a prescription pill. It was some sort of a diet, a diet thing. It still is a prescription pill. It still is. That's right. It's actually, I believe, according to the FDA, or not FDA, DEA, it's safer than marijuana, which is kind of amusing. Not really amusing, it's sad, but. You mean as far as its schedule? Right. But when they started to crack down on methamphetamine, that's when we got this bathtub methamphetamine that people are making in their back. You know what I mean? Exactly. They're setting their house on fire and all these dangerous circumstances. So again, if you care about drug addicts, then the only compassionate solution is to completely legalize the purchase or decriminalize the purchase and sale and creation of these products so they can again be made in quality controlled environments, in laboratory conditions, distributed with usage instructions, distributed in quality controlled ways where you know what the doses are and you aren't taking some crazy risks like you do today. I think it's really important to point out that there is one place in the world, I'm positive they still do it, I believe it's in Holland, they have legal heroin. They're the only place in the world that has this. Is it the church, the one that they vend out the church window? No, it's government. This is a government program. Because I know there's like a church in Holland where you can inject heroin. Well, no, this is pharmaceutical grade heroin that the government actually gives to you. If you're an addict, you get like a prescription for heroin. And their crimes like robbery and things like that went down 70% because they had a real problem with heroin in the 70s. Well, the same thing happened in Portugal when they decriminalized drugs there over the last decade. And heroin addicts will tell you over there that they still have problems. You know what I mean? They have a ton of problems. They're junkies. But they can work. But they don't get locked up. They can work and they function like alcoholics would. Yep. And that's a way better situation for a human being to be in than the one in which they are wondering when they're going to go to jail next. They are afraid and they're out there robbing and stealing and hurting people. It's a better situation for them. It's also a better situation for everybody else. Because in addition to what you're talking about, there's public health issues like the spread of HIV and hepatitis and things like that when you've got heroin junkies living on the streets shooting up heroin with rainwater. I mean. Right. So it's all about harm reduction. It's about helping these people survive and down the line hopefully beat their bad habit. Right. And let's. You don't help them with that by throwing them in a jail cell. Take a look at alcoholics. I mean, you know, nobody would propose to make alcohol illegal and throw them in a jail cell. There's no alcoholics in jail unless they do something, you know, as a result of being drunk that they, you know, should be held criminally liable for. Some people would propose it. There is the Prohibition Party. There is a small percentage of the population that most people would consider to be insane. Yeah. That propose this with alcohol. But for some reason it is popular. But when Ron Paul gets on television and says we need to end the war on drugs, people think he's trying to. It's too wacky. People think Ron Paul's trying to dope people up on heroin, which is nonsense. And I think people should consider that they don't really have opinions, that they just parrot the things that they're told. In many cases. Let's try it again. One more time here before we go. Ed, you're back on Free Talk Live from Tennessee. Hey, how y'all doing? Hey, Ed, go ahead with your thoughts. Hey, I just want to kind of warn the young lady there about the MDMA. I've been careful with it. Most of it's a sham, as you probably know. But, you know, a billionaire dude from Microsoft used to have a dance table set up in the nightclub. Y'all know about that in the 80s? Yes, I am actually. I've been doing MDMA for 11 years now, and I am a huge proponent of test kits. I have one. I bring it everywhere I go. I show my friends. I'm very aware of DanceSafe. It's actually where I purchased my test kits. So I appreciate your concern, but you need not be. What's a good concern? What's a good concern for everyone listening? For those who are considering doing drugs really need to. Because what's realistic to believe people are going to. So let's understand that and move ahead and help them be safe. The DanceSafe organization, DanceSafe.org, they have these test kits that they sell for probably a cost. $20. It's cheaper now. $20 for a marquee. So, you know, you can get this kit and be a little bit more sure about what it is that you're pretty sure about what it is you're putting into your body as opposed to just completely random chance and seeing what happens. Ed, thanks for the heads up. Appreciate hearing from you tonight and everybody else out there. Be safe. You can learn more about various drugs at Arrowhead.org.

Ed, you're on Free Talk Live with Ian Julia and Mark. Ed in Tennessee. Ed in Tennessee going once. Is Ed's pot turned up? Ed in Tennessee going twice. I'm going to put Ed back on hold here for a moment. Maybe something went wrong with his cell phone or something like that. Or there's a technical difficulty. We'll try him again here in a little bit. 855-450-3733. So we're talking about a pretty scary drug. It's called desomorphine or the crocodile, known as crocodile in Russia, where it's become fairly popular because, well, it's a consequence of the war on drugs. They've cracked down on imports of Afghani drugs. It's a consequence of heroin. And as a result of that, since the heroin's not hitting the streets in the way that it was, somebody has come up with an alternative. As they always will. Right. Because people are demanding to get high. And so the market will supply that demand. Unfortunately, this particular alternative is rotting people's skin off. I think it's necessary to point out, too, that it's not just like your skin isn't turning black. Like it's literally falling off so that your bones are exposed like in a scary movie. I mean, it's awful. Right. You're not exaggerating. I mean, it's just just thinking back to the picture that I saw is just disgusting to me. Literally just no skin. I mean, I don't even understand how anyone can live like that. And apparently you don't live for very long. The article gave 18 months. Basically, once all of your skin falls off or enough of it falls off, you die. I mean, you can't you can't live without your skin. It's your biggest and most important organ. Skin. You're going to have all kind of nasty germs and disease and things like that getting in your body. Things are going to go poorly. Yeah. So this is terrible. And it's happening because of the war on drugs. In fact, you could say that methamphetamine never would have come about had it not been for the war on drugs. No, I would absolutely I would say crack is another one that probably wouldn't exist were it not for the war on drugs. Right. These are ways to, you know, the people sort of, you know, the drugs morphed because of the war on drugs. Crack, maybe not. It's hard. It's really hard to say. A lot of people have made really great arguments. People, people more studied and smarter than I have. I am have said that crack wouldn't exist. It does seem to some ways like a more efficient use of cocaine. I'm not sure entirely. But but doesn't crack wasn't crack created because cocaine is very expensive. Yep. And crack is a way cheaper high. I mean, you get more for your money, basically. It's a more efficient use of the cocaine that you have. Yeah. So it may very well have come about in that, you know, for that purpose. I'm not entirely sure. I wouldn't make the claim. Some people who know more about this stuff have that I do have claimed otherwise. And I'm not entirely certain. But what I can tell you is whatever is being done at this point isn't working. I think the people that support the war on drugs and they are out there, many of them work for the government. It's hard for them. It's hard for us to get them to call the show and actually have to. They don't have their opinion is already a fact. So they don't have to express it. I think the people that support the war on drugs should really come out with how they really feel. Because, please, don't give me this crap that you want people to stop doing drugs because it's good for them. Because that would suggest you actually give a damn about those people. And if you actually gave a damn about human beings who are using drugs or addicted to drugs, because not all drug users are addicted. But if you actually gave a damn about people who are using drugs, especially the ones that are addicted to them, then you would be advocating for the end of the war on drugs. Because you would understand what we've been saying here for years on this show. This is not this is not new. Drug and its knowledge about it may be new, but this is an old process of whenever prohibition happens, go back to alcohol. Alcohol prohibition that prohibited beer. And all of a sudden, hard liquor came about as a result of that. Hard liquor existed, but bootlegging was very dangerous. And a lot of people died. Well, it became very popular. Hard liquor, the use of the transport of hard liquor became very popular. The consumption of hard liquor, because it's easier to transport liquor than it is beer. Beer has more water in it. Dollar for dollar, you're going to make more transporting a truckload of hard liquor. Liquor became more popular as a result. And in fact, it has, I think now just as a percentage of consumption, it still hasn't gotten all the way back down to what it was pre-prohibition. So essentially what prohibition did to some extent, you know, one of the things that prohibition did, I shouldn't say essentially, one of the things that prohibition did was increase the amount of liquor consumed as a percentage of alcohol consumption. Right. And similarly, it increased, it created crack cocaine, it created methamphetamine, it created these difficult, dangerous situations in which they're manufactured and distributed. I think it's important to point out that it didn't exactly create methamphetamine, but it did create methamphetamine as we know it today. Methamphetamine was actually originally a prescription pill. It was some sort of a diet, a diet thing. It still is a prescription pill. It still is. That's right. It's actually, I believe, according to the FDA, or not FDA, DEA, it's safer than marijuana, which is kind of amusing. Not really amusing, it's sad, but. You mean as far as its schedule? Right. But when they started to crack down on methamphetamine, that's when we got this bathtub methamphetamine that people are making in their back. You know what I mean? Exactly. They're setting their house on fire and all these dangerous circumstances. So again, if you care about drug addicts, then the only compassionate solution is to completely legalize the purchase or decriminalize the purchase and sale and creation of these products so they can again be made in quality controlled environments, in laboratory conditions, distributed with usage instructions, distributed in quality controlled ways where you know what the doses are and you aren't taking some crazy risks like you do today. I think it's really important to point out that there is one place in the world, I'm positive they still do it, I believe it's in Holland, they have legal heroin. They're the only place in the world that has this. Is it the church, the one that they vend out the church window? No, it's government. This is a government program. Because I know there's like a church in Holland where you can inject heroin. Well, no, this is pharmaceutical grade heroin that the government actually gives to you. If you're an addict, you get like a prescription for heroin. And their crimes like robbery and things like that went down 70% because they had a real problem with heroin in the 70s. Well, the same thing happened in Portugal when they decriminalized drugs there over the last decade. And heroin addicts will tell you over there that they still have problems. You know what I mean? They have a ton of problems. They're junkies. But they can work. But they don't get locked up. They can work and they function like alcoholics would. Yep. And that's a way better situation for a human being to be in than the one in which they are wondering when they're going to go to jail next. They are afraid and they're out there robbing and stealing and hurting people. It's a better situation for them. It's also a better situation for everybody else. Because in addition to what you're talking about, there's public health issues like the spread of HIV and hepatitis and things like that when you've got heroin junkies living on the streets shooting up heroin with rainwater. I mean. Right. So it's all about harm reduction. It's about helping these people survive and down the line hopefully beat their bad habit. Right. And let's. You don't help them with that by throwing them in a jail cell. Take a look at alcoholics. I mean, you know, nobody would propose to make alcohol illegal and throw them in a jail cell. There's no alcoholics in jail unless they do something, you know, as a result of being drunk that they, you know, should be held criminally liable for. Some people would propose it. There is the Prohibition Party. There is a small percentage of the population that most people would consider to be insane. Yeah. That propose this with alcohol. But for some reason it is popular. But when Ron Paul gets on television and says we need to end the war on drugs, people think he's trying to. It's too wacky. People think Ron Paul's trying to dope people up on heroin, which is nonsense. And I think people should consider that they don't really have opinions, that they just parrot the things that they're told. In many cases. Let's try it again. One more time here before we go. Ed, you're back on Free Talk Live from Tennessee. Hey, how y'all doing? Hey, Ed, go ahead with your thoughts. Hey, I just want to kind of warn the young lady there about the MDMA. I've been careful with it. Most of it's a sham, as you probably know. But, you know, a billionaire dude from Microsoft used to have a dance table set up in the nightclub. Y'all know about that in the 80s? Yes, I am actually. I've been doing MDMA for 11 years now, and I am a huge proponent of test kits. I have one. I bring it everywhere I go. I show my friends. I'm very aware of DanceSafe. It's actually where I purchased my test kits. So I appreciate your concern, but you need not be. What's a good concern? What's a good concern for everyone listening? For those who are considering doing drugs really need to. Because what's realistic to believe people are going to. So let's understand that and move ahead and help them be safe. The DanceSafe organization, DanceSafe.org, they have these test kits that they sell for probably a cost. $20. It's cheaper now. $20 for a marquee. So, you know, you can get this kit and be a little bit more sure about what it is that you're pretty sure about what it is you're putting into your body as opposed to just completely random chance and seeing what happens. Ed, thanks for the heads up. Appreciate hearing from you tonight and everybody else out there. Be safe. You can learn more about various drugs at Arrowhead.org.
