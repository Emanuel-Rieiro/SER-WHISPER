{"text": " How did your own experience as a TFA Corps member affect your beliefs about education? So as you said, Marty, I was a 1988 Corps member and I taught in Phoenix. And, you know, that question in my mind brings up three clear moments for me that really had an impact. The first was my very first day of teaching right out of college. I had 36 first graders walk into my door. I had 30 desks. I had no books and I had no curriculum. And I quickly came to realize that my kids had no letter recognition and they were part of a bilingual system that truly had no coherence or vision throughout my elementary school. And my school just lacked the basics of what you would expect any child to have that is attending any school, you know, a rigorous curriculum, a clear vision, a conducive learning environment and so forth. That's one story. The second sort of image that comes into my mind is one of my students, Jasmine, had these chronic headaches. And for a while I thought maybe she just, you know, was trying to get out of work. But what I came to realize is that she had horrific tooth pain because she had a mouthful of cavities. And when I started to ask the rest of my kids about dental hygiene practices, I came to realize, you know, my kids didn't practice, have the basics on dental hygiene or didn't have access to dental care. And that was the beginning of me becoming exposed to understanding that my kids are coming to school with so many unmet needs that are just basic needs that every child should have. And the third story I would say that has stuck with me and really shaped my life is that I had a lot of kids that were coming to school with very, very low grades and very low grades. And I would say that the first thing that really hit me was that I was, you know, your first year typical core member. I was terrified to let my children down and I was climbing a very steep learning curve. And so I worked very hard. I was that person that beat everyone to school except our janitor and would stay late. And this one afternoon in my first semester of teaching, a veteran teacher came into my classroom and she asked, you know, as we were chatting, she asked me why I worked so hard because she wanted me to do a lot of things. And I said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And she said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And I said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And she said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. I came to realize like there are just so many barriers here that need to be overcome in terms of supporting my kids to get their unmet needs met. And then, of course, doing all the work that must be done in the schools and education in my own classroom. But through it all, as I got to know my students and family, I mean, they're just hardworking folks who are my parents are trying to do what's best for their kids. And sometimes needed a little extra support to know how to best support their kids. But overall, you just saw this context where everyone just wanted to excel. And so I emerged from my experience really just inspired by my students and my family. I was pretty outraged about what was happening and how much of, you know, a child's access or opportunity is just driven by where she or he happens to be born and where he or she happens to go to school. And I think I started to just better understand the complexity of the problem that's happening outside of school in communities, you know, where children are living in poverty and what that means inside of classrooms and whole schools and districts. And what, you know, the beginning of what it might take to do something about this and really committed to being part of the solution and really committed and determined to get to the day when truly every child does have access to a great opportunity. And in introducing our conversation, I noted TFA's two-pronged theory of change that aims to address those challenges that you saw firsthand during your time in Phoenix, both through its core members' time in Phoenix and through its core members' time in Phoenix. And I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. of leaders who are working alongside many others to drive real change. And our theory is that you need to get, you know, folks really proximate to the problem so that the problem becomes personal and raw and really propels you to do something about this for life. It builds conviction, it builds courage and, you know, the will to do the hard stuff that's required in order to make real change. And so we've seen over and over again that getting folks in the middle of this changes hearts and minds. It leads to a lifetime commitment of working towards equity and excellence for all kids. And you come to understand again the systemic barrier that our children are up against. And you realize that progress actually really can be made at the individual level, but the long-term sustained enduring progress needs to be, you know, at the systems level. And so all of our members are placed in the classroom. They teach in urban and rural communities that are, you know, that serve low-income communities and predominantly students of color. They all go through a six to seven week training that are run either regionally or nationally. And they all, when they enter the classroom, they all have a set of supports that we have in every community that is actively supporting our teachers to be great for kids in the classroom, but also nurturing the community of, you know, the core that they're a part of and working towards this change together. So let's turn to the article's findings. The authors, Catherine Kahn, Virginia Loveson, and Cecilia Moe, first examine a series of questions about the sources of educational inequity in the United States. And they conclude, I'll quote them, that TFA participants are more likely to believe that societal issues, not differences in the actions or values of students from low-income backgrounds, exacerbate income-based differences in achievement. So for example, they're less likely to agree that poor families don't value education as much as richer families and more likely to agree that systematic injustices perpetuate inequity throughout society. Why do you think that's the case? I mean, I would say very simply because that is what you see. You know, you see it for yourself. You see this playing out with real people in real classrooms, with real children and families. And so you really get in the middle of it. Again, this proximity brings insights and understanding of the complex nature of the problem, but also like, you know, what are the root causes? And, you know, I've never met a core member that, you know, would say at the end of two years that, you know, our families don't care about their kids' education or, you know, you just more, deeply understand all that's at play, which is the power of getting right in the middle of it. And then a second set of questions explores TFA alums' views of prominent education reforms. And here there were a few surprises, at least to me. I was struck by the fact that TFA participants were 15 percentage points less likely to support the expansion of high-quality charter schools, despite the fact that many of them had taught in those settings. TFA participants were also less likely to see a need to reduce dependence on standardized testing in American schools. And despite allegations that TFA is some kind of a union-busting organization, TFA participation had no impact on participants' views of collective bargaining. What do you make of those findings? Well, you know, I must say, Marty, I'm not surprised by the findings. So I understand that some folks might be because, I do think there's this impression that everyone in the Teach for America network comes to the same conclusions about the solutions that we ought to be pursuing. And in fact, you know, I would say the thing that we have in common is that we deeply care about public schools. We deeply care about ensuring every child truly has, you know, educational excellence and equity and this unwavering belief in the potential of our kids. And so it's hard to tell, I think, the average alum that things aren't possible or there's just not a way forward. But beyond that, I do really, my experience is that in terms of what are the pathways forward for progress and solutions, they really do vary. And I think they vary because the work is so local and different. And, you know, I think people root themselves in their communities, obviously, and they find that there are different ways forward. And you realize that, you know, the solutions are in the community and they must be co-created by the community. And so folks, you know, come to different conclusions. I mean, if we just take the charter findings, they do show that TFA folks are right in the middle. They're neutral on charters. And the reason it's not surprising to me is because, you know, we're in over 50 different communities and the regions are different, how folks articulate what the needs are. And how folks are trying to advance, you know, the work and what the vision is for the community and children are different. And so how they come at it varies. And in some of our communities, there's, you know, a lot of excellent public, you know, high quality district schools and charter schools. Some have more charter schools than district schools. And I think that really does shape how our folks think about the work. And, you know, I, of course, you know, in the paper, it also talks about how our kids are more responsible for founding some of the most successful and highest impact charter schools in the country, like KIPP and IDEA and YES Prep. And more of which, you know, I believe have played such a critical role in showing us what's possible, you know, and putting children on fundamentally different trajectories that are coming from low-income communities and children of color. And I've personally witnessed this because I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley where IDEA has been operating for over 20 years. And it's been incredible. But I just think at the end of the day, folks are rooted in their community and, you know, taking their lessons learned and applying them in different ways. And when it comes down to any particular policy question, I think just getting rooted in the context and the vision and, you know, what the community is co-creating is where the solutions come, which end up varying region by region. And then a final set of items reveals that the TFA experience doesn't make core members more cynical or pessimistic about the challenge of improving education. In fact, alums are more likely than non-participants to agree that it's possible for all children to attain an excellent education and less likely to agree that there's only so much teachers can do to help low-income students succeed. That result must be gratifying as one could easily imagine the differences going the other way. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible to see that, you know, our folks are emerging from this with optimism and hope and a deep belief that the problem is solvable, which is, you know, the big objective here as folks enter the work. And so much of it, I would say, is really being able to be with your students and see what they're capable of and then doubling down and realizing that there has to be a path forward and being part of, you know, challenging the status quo. And creating different realities is our mandate. And our kids show us why that's needed. And it's sort of, you can't, you can't look, you know, when you see something you can't look at and you stick with it and do whatever you can to ensure that you do your part to contribute to the end of ensuring all kids get what they deserve.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.1, "text": " How did your own experience as a TFA Corps member affect your beliefs about education?", "seek": 0.0,

So as you said, Marty, I was a 1988 Corps member and I taught in Phoenix. And, you know, that question in my mind brings up three clear moments for me that really had an impact. The first was my very first day of teaching right out of college. I had 36 first graders walk into my door. I had 30 desks. I had no books and I had no curriculum. And I quickly came to realize that my kids had no letter recognition and they were part of a bilingual system that truly had no coherence or vision throughout my elementary school. And my school just lacked the basics of what you would expect any child to have that is attending any school, you know, a rigorous curriculum, a clear vision, a conducive learning environment and so forth. That's one story. The second sort of image that comes into my mind is one of my students, Jasmine, had these chronic headaches. And for a while I thought maybe she just, you know, was trying to get out of work. But what I came to realize is that she had horrific tooth pain because she had a mouthful of cavities. And when I started to ask the rest of my kids about dental hygiene practices, I came to realize, you know, my kids didn't practice, have the basics on dental hygiene or didn't have access to dental care. And that was the beginning of me becoming exposed to understanding that my kids are coming to school with so many unmet needs that are just basic needs that every child should have. And the third story I would say that has stuck with me and really shaped my life is that I had a lot of kids that were coming to school with very, very low grades and very low grades. And I would say that the first thing that really hit me was that I was, you know, your first year typical core member. I was terrified to let my children down and I was climbing a very steep learning curve. And so I worked very hard. I was that person that beat everyone to school except our janitor and would stay late. And this one afternoon in my first semester of teaching, a veteran teacher came into my classroom and she asked, you know, as we were chatting, she asked me why I worked so hard because she wanted me to do a lot of things. And I said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And she said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And I said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. And she said, well, I'm going to do a lot of things. I came to realize like there are just so many barriers here that need to be overcome in terms of supporting my kids to get their unmet needs met. And then, of course, doing all the work that must be done in the schools and education in my own classroom. But through it all, as I got to know my students and family, I mean, they're just hardworking folks who are my parents are trying to do what's best for their kids. And sometimes needed a little extra support to know how to best support their kids. But overall, you just saw this context where everyone just wanted to excel. And so I emerged from my experience really just inspired by my students and my family. I was pretty outraged about what was happening and how much of, you know, a child's access or opportunity is just driven by where she or he happens to be born and where he or she happens to go to school. And I think I started to just better understand the complexity of the problem that's happening outside of school in communities, you know, where children are living in poverty and what that means inside of classrooms and whole schools and districts. And what, you know, the beginning of what it might take to do something about this and really committed to being part of the solution and really committed and determined to get to the day when truly every child does have access to a great opportunity. And in introducing our conversation, I noted TFA's two-pronged theory of change that aims to address those challenges that you saw firsthand during your time in Phoenix, both through its core members' time in Phoenix and through its core members' time in Phoenix. And I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. And so I think that's really important. of leaders who are working alongside many others to drive real change. And our theory is that you need to get, you know, folks really proximate to the problem so that the problem becomes personal and raw and really propels you to do something about this for life. It builds conviction, it builds courage and, you know, the will to do the hard stuff that's required in order to make real change. And so we've seen over and over again that getting folks in the middle of this changes hearts and minds. It leads to a lifetime commitment of working towards equity and excellence for all kids. And you come to understand again the systemic barrier that our children are up against. And you realize that progress actually really can be made at the individual level, but the long-term sustained enduring progress needs to be, you know, at the systems level. And so all of our members are placed in the classroom. They teach in urban and rural communities that are, you know, that serve low-income communities and predominantly students of color. They all go through a six to seven week training that are run either regionally or nationally. And they all, when they enter the classroom, they all have a set of supports that we have in every community that is actively supporting our teachers to be great for kids in the classroom, but also nurturing the community of, you know, the core that they're a part of and working towards this change together. So let's turn to the article's findings. The authors, Catherine Kahn, Virginia Loveson, and Cecilia Moe, first examine a series of questions about the sources of educational inequity in the United States. And they conclude, I'll quote them, that TFA participants are more likely to believe that societal issues, not differences in the actions or values of students from low-income backgrounds, exacerbate income-based differences in achievement. So for example, they're less likely to agree that poor families don't value education as much as richer families and more likely to agree that systematic injustices perpetuate inequity throughout society. Why do you think that's the case? I mean, I would say very simply because that is what you see. You know, you see it for yourself. You see this playing out with real people in real classrooms, with real children and families. And so you really get in the middle of it. Again, this proximity brings insights and understanding of the complex nature of the problem, but also like, you know, what are the root causes? And, you know, I've never met a core member that, you know, would say at the end of two years that, you know, our families don't care about their kids' education or, you know, you just more, deeply understand all that's at play, which is the power of getting right in the middle of it. And then a second set of questions explores TFA alums' views of prominent education reforms. And here there were a few surprises, at least to me. I was struck by the fact that TFA participants were 15 percentage points less likely to support the expansion of high-quality charter schools, despite the fact that many of them had taught in those settings. TFA participants were also less likely to see a need to reduce dependence on standardized testing in American schools. And despite allegations that TFA is some kind of a union-busting organization, TFA participation had no impact on participants' views of collective bargaining. What do you make of those findings? Well, you know, I must say, Marty, I'm not surprised by the findings. So I understand that some folks might be because, I do think there's this impression that everyone in the Teach for America network comes to the same conclusions about the solutions that we ought to be pursuing. And in fact, you know, I would say the thing that we have in common is that we deeply care about public schools. We deeply care about ensuring every child truly has, you know, educational excellence and equity and this unwavering belief in the potential of our kids. And so it's hard to tell, I think, the average alum that things aren't possible or there's just not a way forward. But beyond that, I do really, my experience is that in terms of what are the pathways forward for progress and solutions, they really do vary. And I think they vary because the work is so local and different. And, you know, I think people root themselves in their communities, obviously, and they find that there are different ways forward. And you realize that, you know, the solutions are in the community and they must be co-created by the community. And so folks, you know, come to different conclusions. I mean, if we just take the charter findings, they do show that TFA folks are right in the middle. They're neutral on charters. And the reason it's not surprising to me is because, you know, we're in over 50 different communities and the regions are different, how folks articulate what the needs are. And how folks are trying to advance, you know, the work and what the vision is for the community and children are different. And so how they come at it varies. And in some of our communities, there's, you know, a lot of excellent public, you know, high quality district schools and charter schools. Some have more charter schools than district schools. And I think that really does shape how our folks think about the work. And, you know, I, of course, you know, in the paper, it also talks about how our kids are more responsible for founding some of the most successful and highest impact charter schools in the country, like KIPP and IDEA and YES Prep. And more of which, you know, I believe have played such a critical role in showing us what's possible, you know, and putting children on fundamentally different trajectories that are coming from low-income communities and children of color. And I've personally witnessed this because I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley where IDEA has been operating for over 20 years. And it's been incredible. But I just think at the end of the day, folks are rooted in their community and, you know, taking their lessons learned and applying them in different ways. And when it comes down to any particular policy question, I think just getting rooted in the context and the vision and, you know, what the community is co-creating is where the solutions come, which end up varying region by region. And then a final set of items reveals that the TFA experience doesn't make core members more cynical or pessimistic about the challenge of improving education. In fact, alums are more likely than non-participants to agree that it's possible for all children to attain an excellent education and less likely to agree that there's only so much teachers can do to help low-income students succeed. That result must be gratifying as one could easily imagine the differences going the other way. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible to see that, you know, our folks are emerging from this with optimism and hope and a deep belief that the problem is solvable, which is, you know, the big objective here as folks enter the work. And so much of it, I would say, is really being able to be with your students and see what they're capable of and then doubling down and realizing that there has to be a path forward and being part of, you know, challenging the status quo. And creating different realities is our mandate. And our kids show us why that's needed. And it's sort of, you can't, you can't look, you know, when you see something you can't look at and you stick with it and do whatever you can to ensure that you do your part to contribute to the end of ensuring all kids get what they deserve.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.1, "text": " How did your own experience as a TFA Corps member affect your beliefs about education?",
