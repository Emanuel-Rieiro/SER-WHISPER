{"text": " This is going to be a show that's full of listener emails because, A, we've been getting too many listener emails to kind of fit into the show in a graceful way. So this is just going to be packed with listener emails. And second of all, by the time this airs, I'm actually going to be out of town. So we're actually pre-recording this show. Yeah, way ahead of time. So since we can't predict the future, we're just going to do timeless stuff and hope that you enjoy it. This isn't really a news show anyway. You know, sometimes we do have news articles, but they're not particularly timely news. It's not current events. I mean, this is just, this is fun. Yeah, exactly. We didn't, you know, when we started the show, we really didn't want to do like anything serious. Like I couldn't handle doing another serious show. I'm already a part of several serious podcasts, which is great. I love being taken seriously and everything, but I need some silly time too. So Sex and Science Hour is the time to unwind and have fun. And I hope you like that too. But yeah, we can't really handle doing a current events show because, you know, we're busy people. We can't always record, you know, every week, right the day before it comes out or whatever. So bear with us and hope you enjoy the show anyway. I think people like it. We've been getting a lot of good feedback from our listeners. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, like you said, we get so many emails. I mean, a lot of people are listening. A lot of people have a lot they want to say, and I love it. Yes. Even if they disagree, I love it. Even if they disagree or even if they have complaints, that's fine with us. Right. What we want to talk about is a complaint. So brace yourself, Brian. This is a theme that's been coming up on the show a lot. He starts off by saying, and this is from Steve, Stephen. And he starts off by saying that he freaking loves our show. So thank you, Stephen. We freaking love you too. Yes, we do. But then he says that it sounds like he was really excited to listen to the episode where, which we had titled Sadoji Nakamoto, where we talked about your friend who had posted on Facebook that she was a doge millionaire. Yes. And we were very skeptical of that claim because the market cap is only like $70 million. Right. So she would have to have a lot of doge, hence then she would have to be Sadoji Nakamoto, the creator of doge. Right. Which isn't really the creator of doge. No. I don't know who it is, but it's not Sadoji Nakamoto. It's Bill something. That was just a joke. Yeah. Anyway, go ahead. Bill Gates? No, no, no, no. Not even, no. Bill Doge? Yeah. Anyway, so he was listening to that episode. He was really excited to listen to the episode. Really excited because he is part of the dogecoin community. But he said that the time we spent discussing doge was very disappointing. Our statements were rooted in ignorance rather than truth, almost like the way that the mainstream media covers Bitcoin. And he said, while dogecoin was conceived and brought into existence purely as a joke, it has evolved into so much more than that. The fact is that the dogecoin subreddit did indeed rally behind a fundraiser by the Dogecoin Foundation to send the Jamaican bobsled team Sadoji. Over 27 million doge were amassed at the address and converted to fiat via Bitcoin for a donation of over 30,000 US dollars. If that wasn't enough, upon hearing that the Indian loser Shiva Keshavan would also not have the funds to get to Sadoji, the community managed to raise 4.5 million doge in about seven days in order to contribute over 6,000 US dollars. Although the Indian Ministry of Sports ended up pulling through and funding their trip, the money was then forwarded to Doge for Kids, another dogecoin foundation initiative in support of the Four Paws for Ability, which probably does like helper dogs. What are they called? The guide dogs. Yeah. Yeah. So while our community may be relatively unknown beyond Reddit and our currency denominations may require too many zeros to express any value, which might not be a bad thing, we do very real fundraising. And that is no joke. You can see what else the Dogecoin Foundation is currently working on here. I look forward to seeing next week's episode. P.S. This email contains solely my opinion and should not be construed as any statement of opinion by r slash Dogecoin or the Dogecoin Foundation. There's a Dogecoin Foundation. Yes. Okay. All that sounds so nice. And it's so nice. Yes, I agree. And Stephen, we're sorry. Okay. Perhaps our statements were rooted in ignorance. However, I'm going to defend being skeptical of everything because when I hear an article that says, oh yeah, we sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. That sounds like BS. I mean, it sounds like a joke. It sounds like a movie, which it was. Right. We've heard this movie before, right? Exactly. And so I was, you know, I thought, okay, it must be a joke before that. And we actually tried investigating this. We couldn't find a video. I barely found a video. Yeah. I mean, we couldn't really find much that verified it. So, you know, in the spirit of being kind of skeptical of everything and not trying not to be too credulous, lest you get fooled, scammed or or made to look like an idiot. We decided to err on the side of caution and not believe the story. But perhaps he's saying it's really true. But like, I can't believe I really, you know, I feel so bad because if this is all true, then you have my highest respect. Please make no mistake. But I still don't know that even any of that's all real. You think he's making up the whole email? I don't know. Because, I mean, you should have seen like this one friend of mine, you should have seen what she wrote up. And a whole bunch of people that don't know anything about Bitcoin, let alone Dogecoin, were like, wow, how did this happen? They weren't joking around. I know who they are. These people are in their 60s. You know, they have no idea what she's talking about. Some of them were younger, though, and they still didn't know what she was talking about. And she just kept playing it up. And like, that's part of the fun with Doge, I guess. And continuing with her, you know, her play, you know, she said, yeah, we even sent a Jamaican bobsled team and all this stuff. So it was mixing up with things that weren't obviously not true. That may be true and that clearly aren't. Yeah. With the whole Dogecoin thing, I don't know what to believe. I just, I avoid it. Yeah, it's one of those things that makes me say, I don't know what's real. I mean, okay, I'm going to say right now, I'm willing to give, I'm willing to say, yeah, they did do all that fundraising. And that's great. Thank you so much. It's really important to do cryptocurrency charitable projects. And I really value them. Thank you, Doge community. And they are cool. Like, they're fun. They make funny tweets and ha ha cute memes and so forth. To the moon. That's great. And they have, raise the awareness of cryptocurrency. Totally. I mean, I give them credit for that. And I'm totally willing to credit. And I'll even believe, I'll believe that that story, you know, if he says that's true. I don't think I would donate to a fundraiser to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. Just because, just because it's, I don't want to get scammed, you know, like it's, there's a certain amount of self-protection involved in kind of the skepticism of not believing stuff. Because, you know, you don't want to look at it as, look like an idiot. You don't want to get fooled, right? But I'm trying to understand like that one. Okay. To sending the Jamaican bobsled team. Like, yeah. Why do, why do something that sounds like a joke? If it's not a joke, right. If the Bitcoin community wouldn't get behind that, why would the Doge community? Like, I don't, I don't, because the Doge community, I assume is a very small part, small percentage of the Bitcoin community. Okay. And in fact, they're like the next level because, you know, they're, they're, they're very much into the crypto. Stuff and all that. And I just, I have a hard time believing that that, that the Jamaican bobsled team would interest them at all. You know, like I, I don't get it. I don't see the Bitcoin, you know, you know what I mean? I don't see the Bitcoin community being yeah. Rah, rah, Olympics, rah, rah, sports, you know, maybe that's just my, you know, my, uh, my, yeah, my aspect. That's your two Doge, two Doge's. Yeah. Well, he does, he did send links in his email. So we'll put the links in the show notes and everything. So he, we, he's got some stuff to back it up. So Steven, thank you for your email. Thank you for not writing off our show because we were perhaps a little ignorant or a little bit cautiously skeptical about Doge. We did try to research it, but you know, we're busy. We can't verify every single claim that we read on the internet. So, uh, we, we appreciate your thoughts. And, uh, Brian, did you hear that China, speaking of ridiculous stuff, China has banned, um, QR codes, buying stuff with QR codes. I heard something. So the, the idea is that, you know, when people scan a QR code, a QR code for anybody who doesn't know is like a barcode, but with your phone, you scan this funny looking square and it tells your phone some information. And, you know, it is possible that, uh, sometimes Bitcoin addresses or other payment information is encoded in those and you would scan it to pay, uh, or, you know, you could do virtual credit card type thing, which uses, um, QR codes, which is apparently there was, was some company in China who, who was saying, that they're going to do that, but they were concerned that sometimes QR codes could contain like some scammy information or take people to a fake website or somehow scam them out of their money or steal their info. Sure. I could, I could see that. Um, you know, the, the way they can just like outlaw an image. Yeah, that's nuts. Can you believe that? It's just like, uh, I mean, that's a pretty big area of free speech. To be just bringing the hammer down on, you know, right. QR codes. Sure. You know, you could say anything you want with a QR code. Maybe you could encode some scammy information that was meant to defraud people, but the fraud is the thing to worry about. Not the QR code, you know, like there's, it's just another example of sort of a blanket ban on a certain technology that is neutral and can be used for a lot of different things. And they say, Oh no, it could be used for bad. So we're going to ban everything.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 2.6, "text": " This is going to be a show that's full of listener emails because,", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [639, 307, 516, 281,

graceful way. So this is just going to be packed with listener emails. And second of all, by the time this airs, I'm actually going to be out of town. So we're actually pre-recording this show. Yeah, way ahead of time. So since we can't predict the future, we're just going to do timeless stuff and hope that you enjoy it. This isn't really a news show anyway. You know, sometimes we do have news articles, but they're not particularly timely news. It's not current events. I mean, this is just, this is fun. Yeah, exactly. We didn't, you know, when we started the show, we really didn't want to do like anything serious. Like I couldn't handle doing another serious show. I'm already a part of several serious podcasts, which is great. I love being taken seriously and everything, but I need some silly time too. So Sex and Science Hour is the time to unwind and have fun. And I hope you like that too. But yeah, we can't really handle doing a current events show because, you know, we're busy people. We can't always record, you know, every week, right the day before it comes out or whatever. So bear with us and hope you enjoy the show anyway. I think people like it. We've been getting a lot of good feedback from our listeners. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, like you said, we get so many emails. I mean, a lot of people are listening. A lot of people have a lot they want to say, and I love it. Yes. Even if they disagree, I love it. Even if they disagree or even if they have complaints, that's fine with us. Right. What we want to talk about is a complaint. So brace yourself, Brian. This is a theme that's been coming up on the show a lot. He starts off by saying, and this is from Steve, Stephen. And he starts off by saying that he freaking loves our show. So thank you, Stephen. We freaking love you too. Yes, we do. But then he says that it sounds like he was really excited to listen to the episode where, which we had titled Sadoji Nakamoto, where we talked about your friend who had posted on Facebook that she was a doge millionaire. Yes. And we were very skeptical of that claim because the market cap is only like $70 million. Right. So she would have to have a lot of doge, hence then she would have to be Sadoji Nakamoto, the creator of doge. Right. Which isn't really the creator of doge. No. I don't know who it is, but it's not Sadoji Nakamoto. It's Bill something. That was just a joke. Yeah. Anyway, go ahead. Bill Gates? No, no, no, no. Not even, no. Bill Doge? Yeah. Anyway, so he was listening to that episode. He was really excited to listen to the episode. Really excited because he is part of the dogecoin community. But he said that the time we spent discussing doge was very disappointing. Our statements were rooted in ignorance rather than truth, almost like the way that the mainstream media covers Bitcoin. And he said, while dogecoin was conceived and brought into existence purely as a joke, it has evolved into so much more than that. The fact is that the dogecoin subreddit did indeed rally behind a fundraiser by the Dogecoin Foundation to send the Jamaican bobsled team Sadoji. Over 27 million doge were amassed at the address and converted to fiat via Bitcoin for a donation of over 30,000 US dollars. If that wasn't enough, upon hearing that the Indian loser Shiva Keshavan would also not have the funds to get to Sadoji, the community managed to raise 4.5 million doge in about seven days in order to contribute over 6,000 US dollars. Although the Indian Ministry of Sports ended up pulling through and funding their trip, the money was then forwarded to Doge for Kids, another dogecoin foundation initiative in support of the Four Paws for Ability, which probably does like helper dogs. What are they called? The guide dogs. Yeah. Yeah. So while our community may be relatively unknown beyond Reddit and our currency denominations may require too many zeros to express any value, which might not be a bad thing, we do very real fundraising. And that is no joke. You can see what else the Dogecoin Foundation is currently working on here. I look forward to seeing next week's episode. P.S. This email contains solely my opinion and should not be construed as any statement of opinion by r slash Dogecoin or the Dogecoin Foundation. There's a Dogecoin Foundation. Yes. Okay. All that sounds so nice. And it's so nice. Yes, I agree. And Stephen, we're sorry. Okay. Perhaps our statements were rooted in ignorance. However, I'm going to defend being skeptical of everything because when I hear an article that says, oh yeah, we sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. That sounds like BS. I mean, it sounds like a joke. It sounds like a movie, which it was. Right. We've heard this movie before, right? Exactly. And so I was, you know, I thought, okay, it must be a joke before that. And we actually tried investigating this. We couldn't find a video. I barely found a video. Yeah. I mean, we couldn't really find much that verified it. So, you know, in the spirit of being kind of skeptical of everything and not trying not to be too credulous, lest you get fooled, scammed or or made to look like an idiot. We decided to err on the side of caution and not believe the story. But perhaps he's saying it's really true. But like, I can't believe I really, you know, I feel so bad because if this is all true, then you have my highest respect. Please make no mistake. But I still don't know that even any of that's all real. You think he's making up the whole email? I don't know. Because, I mean, you should have seen like this one friend of mine, you should have seen what she wrote up. And a whole bunch of people that don't know anything about Bitcoin, let alone Dogecoin, were like, wow, how did this happen? They weren't joking around. I know who they are. These people are in their 60s. You know, they have no idea what she's talking about. Some of them were younger, though, and they still didn't know what she was talking about. And she just kept playing it up. And like, that's part of the fun with Doge, I guess. And continuing with her, you know, her play, you know, she said, yeah, we even sent a Jamaican bobsled team and all this stuff. So it was mixing up with things that weren't obviously not true. That may be true and that clearly aren't. Yeah. With the whole Dogecoin thing, I don't know what to believe. I just, I avoid it. Yeah, it's one of those things that makes me say, I don't know what's real. I mean, okay, I'm going to say right now, I'm willing to give, I'm willing to say, yeah, they did do all that fundraising. And that's great. Thank you so much. It's really important to do cryptocurrency charitable projects. And I really value them. Thank you, Doge community. And they are cool. Like, they're fun. They make funny tweets and ha ha cute memes and so forth. To the moon. That's great. And they have, raise the awareness of cryptocurrency. Totally. I mean, I give them credit for that. And I'm totally willing to credit. And I'll even believe, I'll believe that that story, you know, if he says that's true. I don't think I would donate to a fundraiser to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. Just because, just because it's, I don't want to get scammed, you know, like it's, there's a certain amount of self-protection involved in kind of the skepticism of not believing stuff. Because, you know, you don't want to look at it as, look like an idiot. You don't want to get fooled, right? But I'm trying to understand like that one. Okay. To sending the Jamaican bobsled team. Like, yeah. Why do, why do something that sounds like a joke? If it's not a joke, right. If the Bitcoin community wouldn't get behind that, why would the Doge community? Like, I don't, I don't, because the Doge community, I assume is a very small part, small percentage of the Bitcoin community. Okay. And in fact, they're like the next level because, you know, they're, they're, they're very much into the crypto. Stuff and all that. And I just, I have a hard time believing that that, that the Jamaican bobsled team would interest them at all. You know, like I, I don't get it. I don't see the Bitcoin, you know, you know what I mean? I don't see the Bitcoin community being yeah. Rah, rah, Olympics, rah, rah, sports, you know, maybe that's just my, you know, my, uh, my, yeah, my aspect. That's your two Doge, two Doge's. Yeah. Well, he does, he did send links in his email. So we'll put the links in the show notes and everything. So he, we, he's got some stuff to back it up. So Steven, thank you for your email. Thank you for not writing off our show because we were perhaps a little ignorant or a little bit cautiously skeptical about Doge. We did try to research it, but you know, we're busy. We can't verify every single claim that we read on the internet. So, uh, we, we appreciate your thoughts. And, uh, Brian, did you hear that China, speaking of ridiculous stuff, China has banned, um, QR codes, buying stuff with QR codes. I heard something. So the, the idea is that, you know, when people scan a QR code, a QR code for anybody who doesn't know is like a barcode, but with your phone, you scan this funny looking square and it tells your phone some information. And, you know, it is possible that, uh, sometimes Bitcoin addresses or other payment information is encoded in those and you would scan it to pay, uh, or, you know, you could do virtual credit card type thing, which uses, um, QR codes, which is apparently there was, was some company in China who, who was saying, that they're going to do that, but they were concerned that sometimes QR codes could contain like some scammy information or take people to a fake website or somehow scam them out of their money or steal their info. Sure. I could, I could see that. Um, you know, the, the way they can just like outlaw an image. Yeah, that's nuts. Can you believe that? It's just like, uh, I mean, that's a pretty big area of free speech. To be just bringing the hammer down on, you know, right. QR codes. Sure. You know, you could say anything you want with a QR code. Maybe you could encode some scammy information that was meant to defraud people, but the fraud is the thing to worry about. Not the QR code, you know, like there's, it's just another example of sort of a blanket ban on a certain technology that is neutral and can be used for a lot of different things. And they say, Oh no, it could be used for bad.
