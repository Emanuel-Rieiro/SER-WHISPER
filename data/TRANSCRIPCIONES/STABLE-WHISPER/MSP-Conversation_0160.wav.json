{"text": " That's what I'm talking about. Well on its way to a billion, baby. Let's do this. Let's do this so they can make a sequel and maybe we can get the Justice League. Big shout out to El Boogie in the chat room. Go ahead. Number two is World War Z. It opened up with, it's not number one, my fault. It was number two. It was 66 million domestically. It brings its global growth so far to 111 million. And the number one movie in the country is the 14th film by Pixar and Disney and the prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc., Monsters University. How in the world? Well, I guess it is all of my homies that got kids. I guess this was the weekend that you take all your kids out to the movies. I guess to keep them from acting like crazy. It made the opening weekend. It made 82 million. And it brought it to internationally, it made 54 million combined. It's $136 million. It's one of the biggest openings for Pixar. And I think in the last couple of years, I think since Toy Story 3. So let's move on down to some. Okay, another reboot. Another horror reboot from Fox and MGM. They're rebooting Poltergeist. But they're not looking to revive it. They're not looking to revive the whole entire franchise. They're doing the first film. Of course, the original was, Spielberg was the executive producer. And he might return and do the next one. I'm not too sure. But the next movie is to be produced by Sam Raimi and one of his co-producing partners, Ghost House Pictures, which did the Grudge trilogy. It's to be directed by Gil Keenan, who directed the animated feature of Monsters House. Of course, the original will start with a young girl by the name of Heather O'Rourke, who had an untimely death in 1988. The only three movies she had done was the Poltergeist trilogy. They're not trying so hard to look for a girl. From what it says, they're looking for an unknown. But they're going to look for the adult characters first before they look for the girl. Robert Downey Jr. He has signed on, not for a nine-man four. He signed on for Avengers 2 and 3. He's negotiated. As a co-producer and as playing Tony Stark, nearly $20 million. So the script is going through a couple rewrites right now to include Iron Man and have him do something new. Considering what happened in Iron Man 3, he is a changed man. But they're going to give him something that we haven't seen before yet. Michael Fassbender. Wait a minute. Hold on. Before you move on, have they given any hints on which direction they're going to go with the character? Do something different? Is he going to have a rainbow-colored suit? Oh, no. There was a story arc. Would it be a male Iron Man stripper? What's going on? There was a story arc. There was a story arc in which his arc reactor was removed. His heart was repaired. But somehow he was given the power to control technology or technopathy, like telepathy. He could control computer systems from a mile away. But it feels too much like a superpower for him. He should be the only one that doesn't have a superpower. But it happened in the comics. You want to see how he does with it. Because he's a genius. He doesn't need to be at a desktop or a laptop to really control computers. And that story arc didn't last long. But they're going to try to make something for it in the next films. What's another one? Michael Fassbender from X-Men First Class and 300 and Prometheus. He will play the Leroy in one of the big videos. He's going to be the first one to play the Leroy in one of the big videos. He's going to have to start playing one of them. I mean, one of them does look exciting. I mean, it's up to three games so far. But they're going to start working on it in the fall. What's another one? Independence Day 2. Yes, there is a sequel in development. That was a rumor for a while. I was hoping it wouldn't happen. Roland Emmerich, who's directing the upcoming film White House Down, he's working with a couple writers, says some people will return from the original except for Will Smith. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I know, yeah. You're doing Independence Day 2 without Will Smith. They say he's too expensive. It's technically his franchise. I mean, I'm not saying he owns it, but come on, man. You can't do Independence Day 2 without Will. Get the money. Stop being a cheap flub. What are you going to do? You're going to get Will Smith's son? He's going to come in? He's going to be like the new cadet? Just join? You know, and he's... Well, most of the cast will be back except him. They're also looking for some new actors to play new characters. Bill Pullman, who played the president in the original, he's confirmed that he's coming back for the role. He's not too sure on how the story will be. I mean, he said so himself. In the end, we won. So how are we doing the sequel? He's reading it right now, so... Well, I mean, just because you killed an armada of... Just because you killed an armada of aliens doesn't mean there aren't more aliens. You know what I'm saying? Oh, we defeated them, so what's the thing? Like, yo, you just pissed them off. That was part one. Like, yeah, you can go and kill a whole gang load of our troops. That don't mean we don't have niggas sitting back, you know, chilling like we can't... Right. Like, it's like... You know what I'm saying? Wow. What's good, Kizzy Kate? What's going on, baby? Let's see some more news. Yes. Long-awaited new live-action slash CGI Ninja Turtles film. Still filming in New York. They found somebody to play Shredder. A guy by the name of William Fichtner. William Fichtner was in... He was in Drive Angry about a couple years ago. He was in Armageddon. What's the worst that could happen? Trying to find out. Can't... Wait a minute. So is he... He's supposed to play... So, wait a minute. Is this... Because it's live-action, please tell me they're going to wear suits. Like, I don't want, like... Well, no. They got... I don't know if you've heard. And there's photos where the key actors playing the turtles, they're all wearing motion capture suits. So the turtles will be CG. But it's the avatar technology, what was used, you know, the actors and the motion capture and the performance capture, whatever. So, yeah, the turtles will be CG, but Shredder will be human. For a while, there was... When he talked about the role and talked about working with Michael Bay again because he had not worked with him since Armageddon, it was that iconic... He's playing an iconic character from the comics. Nobody was sure who he was going to play, whether he was going to be the voice of Splinter or he was going to be the Shredder. Nobody knew the difference. So, yeah, he said he's playing Shredder. What's another one? Yeah, they're playing the sequel to Bridesmaids with, of course, Melissa McCarthy, who's going to be in the upcoming movie, The Heat. She's talking about coming back for the sequel. They're going to get most of the cast back for that film. A couple people might not be returning, but Christine Wigg, who used to be on Saturday Night Live, she's going to co-write the screenplay for the sequel. And there's some... Yes, El Boogie, they're doing another Ninja Turtles movie and it's live action slash CG. So you're going to have... It's going to be like the Chipmunks, right? But bigger. Yeah. And no fur. You know, reptilian style, I guess. She said, oh, hell nah. What you talking about, man? Ninja Turtles is that shit, though. What you talking about, man? What you talking about? I love Ninja Turtles. Ninja Turtles is that shit. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to interrupt you. You were saying something about something. No, I was going to say, on a somber note, last week we lost a great actor, incredible actor, James Goldafini, who was... He died June 19th last week. His funeral was this Thursday. He's being buried in Westwood, New Jersey, where he grew up. He was born Joseph... I'm sorry, James Joseph Goldafini Jr., three-time Emmy winner for the longest-running scripted series on HBO, The Sopranos, which ran from 98 to 07. His... Wait a minute. How many seasons did they have? Five. No. That's not the longest running... Because Entourage had eight seasons. So, I mean, if it's the longest running, it's got to be a toss-up between Wire and Sopranos. Looks like that. I think it was like nine or ten. Nine or ten for a season's Yeah, that's crazy, man. Like, yeah. Dude is... He... If y'all don't know who we're talking about, Tony Soprano was the boss of, you know, in the Sopranos film. So, he was it. You know, he was the fat guy that was, you know, I guess, heavy... I don't know. But anyway, let's just say he's gangster. He's like the quintessential mobster character that you would put in any movie. So, that's it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. There's four key films. True Romance, Quentin Tarantino film, Crimson Tide, Get Shorty, the remake of The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He was in Crimson Tide? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. Okay, yeah. I remember. I remember. Yeah, I mean, wait. When you see him in the older films, you better recognize him. Wasn't he the voice in Where the Wild Things Are? Yeah. Right. He played the voice in Where the Wild Things Are. Yeah. He was that one, too. Yeah. You're right. And he was in Pelham 1, 2, 3? Yeah. He was the president. He was the mayor. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was the mayor. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. All right. I agree, El Boogie. Movies just don't need to be redone. Yeah. I'm sorry, but go ahead. Go ahead, K.O. Actually, his last film, James Goldfine, his last three films, he was in Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt. He was in Zero Dog 30 about the Humphrey Osama bin Laden, and he was in a movie that was a flop, but it was the last time anybody's seen him on film. It was The Incredible Burt Wonderstone with Steve Carell. Correct. But he'll be buried Thursday. He died of a heart attack and rolled mentally. That was a three-time Emmy. Oh, sorry, dude. Yeah, baby. He was one of the best, man. He was a very, very good actor. Definitely. Definitely, man. Much respect. Much respect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I guess die gallantly. All right, hey, let me ask you guys a random question. All right, K.O., when you die, how do you want to be buried? Do you want to be buried, or do you want to be cremated? I want to be cremated. That's what my father was. My father was cremated. And then do you want to have the urn sent to somebody? Uh, no. My dad's ashes were spread all around, were spread on Chesapeake Bay, because he, that's where he loved hanging out. People go crabbing, you know, hang out with his friends and family, whatever. You know, if I'm going to be cremated. You want to be spread out over like a karate mat or something? No, no, no, karate mat. You want to be on Iron Mike TV. You know, I call that a place I found comfortable, you know, some part of my life or whatever. You know, that's how I like to be remembered. He wants to be spread out over the VVC Radio studio. That would be weird. Yeah, yeah. You want us to do that? We can roll up and smoke you. Like, that wouldn't be. No, no, don't do that. Don't do that. No, no, no. Smoking K.O. Kissing K.O. wants to be cremated, too. Like, all right. I've already told y'all what I want done when I die. So if y'all don't remember, y'all need to do it. You need to get it together. God damn it. You know what I'm saying? Lockets. What the fuck type gay shit is that? No, I ain't say nothing about no fucking lockets. Yo, shut your ass up. That is the gayest shit ever, yo. For a dude to be like, yeah, I want to be cremated. And I'm going to get 200 lockets. I'm going to give everybody lockets. I did not say that shit, you fucking dick. Put me in a locket. Nigga, look. You take my fucking money from my. You take. All right. Let me tell you guys again. Let me. Because obviously you assholes don't remember. When I die, you take my insurance money. You go to the islands. Everybody. Everybody gets plane tickets. You go to the Virgin Islands. You go to some island, Jamaica, somewhere. You cremate my body before you go. Take me in a urn because it's less expensive than shipping me to the islands and then have me cremated. Cremate me. Go to. Everybody go to the islands. Y'all going to be pissed at me because I ain't going to do that shit. Because we're going to go. Y'all going to get fucked up. Y'all going to get high. Y'all going to get drunk. And then you're going to sprinkle my shit out over the water.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.82, "text": " That's what I'm talking about.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [663, 311, 437, 286, 478,

Well on its way to a billion, baby. Let's do this. Let's do this so they can make a sequel and maybe we can get the Justice League. Big shout out to El Boogie in the chat room. Go ahead. Number two is World War Z. It opened up with, it's not number one, my fault. It was number two. It was 66 million domestically. It brings its global growth so far to 111 million. And the number one movie in the country is the 14th film by Pixar and Disney and the prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc., Monsters University. How in the world? Well, I guess it is all of my homies that got kids. I guess this was the weekend that you take all your kids out to the movies. I guess to keep them from acting like crazy. It made the opening weekend. It made 82 million. And it brought it to internationally, it made 54 million combined. It's $136 million. It's one of the biggest openings for Pixar. And I think in the last couple of years, I think since Toy Story 3. So let's move on down to some. Okay, another reboot. Another horror reboot from Fox and MGM. They're rebooting Poltergeist. But they're not looking to revive it. They're not looking to revive the whole entire franchise. They're doing the first film. Of course, the original was, Spielberg was the executive producer. And he might return and do the next one. I'm not too sure. But the next movie is to be produced by Sam Raimi and one of his co-producing partners, Ghost House Pictures, which did the Grudge trilogy. It's to be directed by Gil Keenan, who directed the animated feature of Monsters House. Of course, the original will start with a young girl by the name of Heather O'Rourke, who had an untimely death in 1988. The only three movies she had done was the Poltergeist trilogy. They're not trying so hard to look for a girl. From what it says, they're looking for an unknown. But they're going to look for the adult characters first before they look for the girl. Robert Downey Jr. He has signed on, not for a nine-man four. He signed on for Avengers 2 and 3. He's negotiated. As a co-producer and as playing Tony Stark, nearly $20 million. So the script is going through a couple rewrites right now to include Iron Man and have him do something new. Considering what happened in Iron Man 3, he is a changed man. But they're going to give him something that we haven't seen before yet. Michael Fassbender. Wait a minute. Hold on. Before you move on, have they given any hints on which direction they're going to go with the character? Do something different? Is he going to have a rainbow-colored suit? Oh, no. There was a story arc. Would it be a male Iron Man stripper? What's going on? There was a story arc. There was a story arc in which his arc reactor was removed. His heart was repaired. But somehow he was given the power to control technology or technopathy, like telepathy. He could control computer systems from a mile away. But it feels too much like a superpower for him. He should be the only one that doesn't have a superpower. But it happened in the comics. You want to see how he does with it. Because he's a genius. He doesn't need to be at a desktop or a laptop to really control computers. And that story arc didn't last long. But they're going to try to make something for it in the next films. What's another one? Michael Fassbender from X-Men First Class and 300 and Prometheus. He will play the Leroy in one of the big videos. He's going to be the first one to play the Leroy in one of the big videos. He's going to have to start playing one of them. I mean, one of them does look exciting. I mean, it's up to three games so far. But they're going to start working on it in the fall. What's another one? Independence Day 2. Yes, there is a sequel in development. That was a rumor for a while. I was hoping it wouldn't happen. Roland Emmerich, who's directing the upcoming film White House Down, he's working with a couple writers, says some people will return from the original except for Will Smith. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I know, yeah. You're doing Independence Day 2 without Will Smith. They say he's too expensive. It's technically his franchise. I mean, I'm not saying he owns it, but come on, man. You can't do Independence Day 2 without Will. Get the money. Stop being a cheap flub. What are you going to do? You're going to get Will Smith's son? He's going to come in? He's going to be like the new cadet? Just join? You know, and he's... Well, most of the cast will be back except him. They're also looking for some new actors to play new characters. Bill Pullman, who played the president in the original, he's confirmed that he's coming back for the role. He's not too sure on how the story will be. I mean, he said so himself. In the end, we won. So how are we doing the sequel? He's reading it right now, so... Well, I mean, just because you killed an armada of... Just because you killed an armada of aliens doesn't mean there aren't more aliens. You know what I'm saying? Oh, we defeated them, so what's the thing? Like, yo, you just pissed them off. That was part one. Like, yeah, you can go and kill a whole gang load of our troops. That don't mean we don't have niggas sitting back, you know, chilling like we can't... Right. Like, it's like... You know what I'm saying? Wow. What's good, Kizzy Kate? What's going on, baby? Let's see some more news. Yes. Long-awaited new live-action slash CGI Ninja Turtles film. Still filming in New York. They found somebody to play Shredder. A guy by the name of William Fichtner. William Fichtner was in... He was in Drive Angry about a couple years ago. He was in Armageddon. What's the worst that could happen? Trying to find out. Can't... Wait a minute. So is he... He's supposed to play... So, wait a minute. Is this... Because it's live-action, please tell me they're going to wear suits. Like, I don't want, like... Well, no. They got... I don't know if you've heard. And there's photos where the key actors playing the turtles, they're all wearing motion capture suits. So the turtles will be CG. But it's the avatar technology, what was used, you know, the actors and the motion capture and the performance capture, whatever. So, yeah, the turtles will be CG, but Shredder will be human. For a while, there was... When he talked about the role and talked about working with Michael Bay again because he had not worked with him since Armageddon, it was that iconic... He's playing an iconic character from the comics. Nobody was sure who he was going to play, whether he was going to be the voice of Splinter or he was going to be the Shredder. Nobody knew the difference. So, yeah, he said he's playing Shredder. What's another one? Yeah, they're playing the sequel to Bridesmaids with, of course, Melissa McCarthy, who's going to be in the upcoming movie, The Heat. She's talking about coming back for the sequel. They're going to get most of the cast back for that film. A couple people might not be returning, but Christine Wigg, who used to be on Saturday Night Live, she's going to co-write the screenplay for the sequel. And there's some... Yes, El Boogie, they're doing another Ninja Turtles movie and it's live action slash CG. So you're going to have... It's going to be like the Chipmunks, right? But bigger. Yeah. And no fur. You know, reptilian style, I guess. She said, oh, hell nah. What you talking about, man? Ninja Turtles is that shit, though. What you talking about, man? What you talking about? I love Ninja Turtles. Ninja Turtles is that shit. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to interrupt you. You were saying something about something. No, I was going to say, on a somber note, last week we lost a great actor, incredible actor, James Goldafini, who was... He died June 19th last week. His funeral was this Thursday. He's being buried in Westwood, New Jersey, where he grew up. He was born Joseph... I'm sorry, James Joseph Goldafini Jr., three-time Emmy winner for the longest-running scripted series on HBO, The Sopranos, which ran from 98 to 07. His... Wait a minute. How many seasons did they have? Five. No. That's not the longest running... Because Entourage had eight seasons. So, I mean, if it's the longest running, it's got to be a toss-up between Wire and Sopranos. Looks like that. I think it was like nine or ten. Nine or ten for a season's Yeah, that's crazy, man. Like, yeah. Dude is... He... If y'all don't know who we're talking about, Tony Soprano was the boss of, you know, in the Sopranos film. So, he was it. You know, he was the fat guy that was, you know, I guess, heavy... I don't know. But anyway, let's just say he's gangster. He's like the quintessential mobster character that you would put in any movie. So, that's it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. There's four key films. True Romance, Quentin Tarantino film, Crimson Tide, Get Shorty, the remake of The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He was in Crimson Tide? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. Okay, yeah. I remember. I remember. Yeah, I mean, wait. When you see him in the older films, you better recognize him. Wasn't he the voice in Where the Wild Things Are? Yeah. Right. He played the voice in Where the Wild Things Are. Yeah. He was that one, too. Yeah. You're right. And he was in Pelham 1, 2, 3? Yeah. He was the president. He was the mayor. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was the mayor. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. All right. I agree, El Boogie. Movies just don't need to be redone. Yeah. I'm sorry, but go ahead. Go ahead, K.O. Actually, his last film, James Goldfine, his last three films, he was in Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt. He was in Zero Dog 30 about the Humphrey Osama bin Laden, and he was in a movie that was a flop, but it was the last time anybody's seen him on film. It was The Incredible Burt Wonderstone with Steve Carell. Correct. But he'll be buried Thursday. He died of a heart attack and rolled mentally. That was a three-time Emmy. Oh, sorry, dude. Yeah, baby. He was one of the best, man. He was a very, very good actor. Definitely. Definitely, man. Much respect. Much respect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I guess die gallantly. All right, hey, let me ask you guys a random question. All right, K.O., when you die, how do you want to be buried? Do you want to be buried, or do you want to be cremated? I want to be cremated. That's what my father was. My father was cremated. And then do you want to have the urn sent to somebody? Uh, no. My dad's ashes were spread all around, were spread on Chesapeake Bay, because he, that's where he loved hanging out. People go crabbing, you know, hang out with his friends and family, whatever. You know, if I'm going to be cremated. You want to be spread out over like a karate mat or something? No, no, no, karate mat. You want to be on Iron Mike TV. You know, I call that a place I found comfortable, you know, some part of my life or whatever. You know, that's how I like to be remembered. He wants to be spread out over the VVC Radio studio. That would be weird. Yeah, yeah. You want us to do that? We can roll up and smoke you. Like, that wouldn't be. No, no, don't do that. Don't do that. No, no, no. Smoking K.O. Kissing K.O. wants to be cremated, too. Like, all right. I've already told y'all what I want done when I die. So if y'all don't remember, y'all need to do it. You need to get it together. God damn it. You know what I'm saying? Lockets. What the fuck type gay shit is that? No, I ain't say nothing about no fucking lockets. Yo, shut your ass up. That is the gayest shit ever, yo. For a dude to be like, yeah, I want to be cremated. And I'm going to get 200 lockets. I'm going to give everybody lockets. I did not say that shit, you fucking dick. Put me in a locket. Nigga, look. You take my fucking money from my. You take. All right. Let me tell you guys again. Let me. Because obviously you assholes don't remember. When I die, you take my insurance money. You go to the islands. Everybody. Everybody gets plane tickets. You go to the Virgin Islands. You go to some island, Jamaica, somewhere. You cremate my body before you go. Take me in a urn because it's less expensive than shipping me to the islands and then have me cremated. Cremate me. Go to. Everybody go to the islands. Y'all going to be pissed at me because I ain't going to do that shit. Because we're going to go. Y'all going to get fucked up. Y'all going to get high. Y'all going to get drunk.
