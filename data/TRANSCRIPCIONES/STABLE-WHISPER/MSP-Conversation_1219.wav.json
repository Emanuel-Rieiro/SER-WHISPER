{"text": " Words are very powerful. Yes, they are. I mean, I think I try to make sure that when I'm upset that I try not to say something because I know even though I'm upset in that moment, if you say something to someone, you can never really take it back. You know, I mean, if you like really go in, you can never really take it back. And honestly, sometimes at the end of the day, that's not how you that's not generally how you feel. You're just angry in that moment. And words are hurtful sometimes, you know, you know, so it's so I try very hard not to go there when I'm angry, because at the end of the day, I still want to have a relationship with the person. And I think if I didn't, or if I didn't care, then I can be like, whatever, and say whatever and be let bygones be bygones. But if I care about the person, I really have to check myself in my anger, like, okay, don't say this. Try to try to make sense of where you're coming from. Like, I really try to do that. And I think I learned that also, because for my mom, my mom, when she gets angry, she says, the most foulest. Oh, so she's a Oh, yeah, she's Michelle, an adult. Very much so. And it's like the words that come out of her mouth. And you're kind of like, where in the world is this coming from? And why are you saying? I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I don't want to be like that. So that's why I'm trying to work on myself so hard now. Because I know that the things I can say can be extremely brutal and hurtful. And I know I have the capability to make someone cry. Yeah, you know, hurt somebody and devastate somebody. So yeah, like I said, that I didn't care. Now I do a lot more. Because, you know, I care about people's feelings, even though people think that I'm with this cold, heartless bitch. I mean, I care. I do care. Are you a cold, heartless bitch? I'm not, but a lot of people think I might be. I mean, I don't care that they think that, but... Yeah, so, but whatever. It is what it is. It is what it is. I don't know what... But yeah, we've all had our she-ther moment. We have, you know. And I've had my moments, too, I have to admit, where I've, you know, but I... Most of the time, I didn't care. I was like, I don't care about this relationship no more. Because I would like to hear it. Because, like, she... I don't... Since I've known her... I don't care about this relationship no more. I have yet to hear her... I've... Your sarcasticness is funny to me. But, like, you getting really angry, I'm gonna have to ask, like, one of your family members, like, can you describe a moment where... Oh, yeah. They can give you... T-Tokia has just, like, lost it on somebody completely. They can give you moments. I trust. I mean, going off, used your hands, flailing, like, the angry black woman, which is our topic for today. Kind of. Sort of. Sort of. I guess I sort of have. Maybe. Because I remember that one time your sister said something was... Because you guys were maybe in Miami or something. You guys were at a club celebrating something for someone. And this girl kept bumping into somebody or something like that. Yeah, yeah. And you were just really keeping it cool. I was. And it was your sister that eventually had to go off. Yeah, she was like... You know, certain things don't bother me. Certain things, really, I could care less or whatever. But whenever that thing is that bothers me, I will let loose. I will let it be known. I will speak about it. I will, you know, go about it. And then depending on how angry I am, you know, at the time or whatever, and if I care or not about what I'm saying, then, you know what I mean? Like, then I can let loose. But most of the time, for the most part, I am... Like, I try to handle things like... They call me the diplomatic one in the family. You are. You are very much so. You are. And I try to do that to be diplomatic. And she tries to see all sides of the story. I try. And not to any fault of her own, but she can see what everyone did wrong in each day. Different instance. I try to. Like, there was a really bad instance a couple years ago where some people that I'm no longer, you know, deal with at all. And she, you know, just gave me a play-by-play synopsis. Like, okay, this is what you could have done better. And this is what they could have done better. Right. And I was just like, you're right. You're absolutely right. There was nothing I could fault in anything that you said. I mean, but, you know, that's just... You know, and you just think about it. Like, you want... Like, I really don't like conflict, honestly. I really don't. But I'm not afraid to have to get into conflict if I have to. But the thing is, I really don't like conflict. So I try to be, like, look at things from as many perspectives as I can before I really, like, okay, you know, let it out or whatever. But, yeah. Okay. So today's topic for discussion for this episode, we're going to be discussing the angry black woman. The angry black woman. Yes. And this has been talked about forever. Yes. Stereotype typecasts, what have you. And so we just really wanted to just give our perspective on it. Yeah. And just talk about it a little bit. Yes. You know, discuss it and see, based on some of the stuff that both of us have read, just to see how we feel about it. And, you know, I mean, is it a valid stigma that's been put on black women today? Right. Is it a valid stigma? Is it a myth? Yes. Is it real? Yes. All of you both. Why is it? Yes. Why does it exist? Yes. Why does an angry black woman exist? Exactly. So, yeah. The most important thing. Right. Why does she exist if she exists? If she exists. Exactly. So, yeah. Let's talk about it. So the Urban Dictionary defines an angry black woman as a state of mind that black females can go into if given proper stimuli. This results in unpredictable behavior and usually results in violence and or chaos. So that's a problem right there. But that could be anybody. Thank you. Thank you. If anyone is given, what did it say? Put in a stimuli? Or what did that definition say? That's a what the fuck. Right. Exactly. Because if anyone is provoked. It's us. It's not. But we're not the only ones that can get provoked. Sure. Exactly. So why are we, why is it, you know. So Wikipedia had a slightly better, because they delved into the origin of it. It said an angry black woman is a derogatory term that refers to black women. It is also formulated as Sapphire or sassy black woman. The angry black woman was popularized in the 1930s radio show Amos and Andy with the character Sapphire. Her nagging, assertive demeanor and frequent emasculation of her husband has been echoed with characters such as Anastor from Sanford and Son and Pam from Martin. The angry black woman archetype has not been studied to the same degree as the Mammy and Jezebel archetypes. Scholars, they say Dion Bennett and Marcelina Morgan suggested the stereotype is less studied because researchers accept it. The stereotype of the angry mean black woman goes unnamed, not because of its insignificance, but because it's considered an essential characteristic of black femininity, regardless of the other stereotypical roles of the black woman may be accused of occupying. These stereotypes are more than representative representations. They're representations that shape realities. And I agree with that statement a hundred percent. You know, our first lady, and she's always, she's going to be my first lady for four years. Forever. Until Agent Orange is impeached. Forever. Forever and ever. And ever. The eloquent, the beautiful. Yes. Miss Michelle Obama. Absolutely. Was labeled as a black, angry black woman. And that whole I think started off the conversation because the New York Times style section from last year called her an angry black woman in a tweet. And that's what set it off. How she overcame that, you know, or what have you. This exact tweet was how Floata shed an angry black woman caricature involved into a political powerhouse. And I never, ever in my wildest dreams envisioned the first lady, Michelle Obama, as an angry black woman. No, not at all. I really don't understand where even the caricatures of it, like even when you're reading Wikipedia, it stems from characterizations of people portraying certain characters. Negative possible characteristics that aren't always, the problem I have with stereotypes in general, and I'm sure other people have regardless, especially as a black person in America as a whole. Right. Is that they make it seem like the whole entire race does this, or acts like this, or eats that, or dresses like that, or says that. Right. And that's not true. That is so not the case. So we're going to get a little political today. Just a little bit. And you're probably going to see both of our angry sides today. Right. My angry black woman. There you go. Will come out. Yes. Yes. Yes. You are great. Miss Michelle. Love it. Okay. I'm always ready. Yes. I'll give it. I will. So yeah, so the big problem I had was when I had heard that, and then she did her final interview as the, well, she's still my first lady, but we'll say technically her final interview is first lady, official first lady. Officially. She said that, you know, the big O, Miss Oprah, asked her, you know, how she felt about that. And she said that it just, it did bother her. You know, she's like, they don't even know her. Right. And she was just like, it showed her that both sides were still afraid. And that she said that it just encouraged her to live her life. More loud so that people could see her life and then judge for themselves. And I think if anyone was really watching, they did not see an angry black woman. She's been described as eloquent. She's been described as upstanding, a beautiful, strong woman. Like you see her strength very clearly without it being an overpowering thing. It's like something that just stands up in its own truth. So why? I just, I, I still don't understand like where that statement came from in regards to her being angry. Is she passionate? Absolutely. As most of us are, we are passionate individuals. So I believe that that's been misconstrued as an angry black woman. Unfortunately. Yes. I just, I feel like she was just labeled that because maybe they didn't have anything else to label her with, you know, I mean, she's a Harvard graduate and she's esteemed. She's very sophisticated and you know, she's had all these accomplishments in her life. She has two beautiful daughters that are also going to be eloquent and, you know, upright in their own lives. And I don't know if people are scared of that. Like she said, people were just afraid of each other. That is a serious possibility because you find that when people start saying things that especially aren't true, you know, or people want to find a way to label you, which, why should you even say that? Even try to label somebody. That's another thing. If you put a label on something, you feel better because you know what it is. You know what it is and you know how to deal with it. Exactly. So, and that's the problem I have. But so, you know, delving into this a little bit more because we're both two African American women, black women. Yes. And, um, you know, just to talk about this, there's so much more to cover in this. So I just want to stress that we're just covering our initial reactions to it and just having just a, a, basic conversation about it because it could be much more that we could say. Definitely. You know, bring people on and talk about, but this is just from our perspective. Absolutely. And I'm sure in future episodes we will delve into a little bit more psychologically, you know, emotionally, this, that, and the third. So this is just a surface type discussion, but I felt like we needed to have it, especially now in the climate that we're in now because everything I feel like is being misconstrued. Everyone is, is on alert and nervous and scared. Yes. And there's even more misunderstandings in the world now that there ever have been, there ever will be because of this asshole that's supposed to be running our country. And I just, and I'm, I'm sorry to say that and just be so derogatory towards him, but you know, I never, ever in a million years thought that we'd be going backward instead of moving forward. And that's exactly what's happening. Exactly. You know, it's like everyone's regressing. Everyone feels now that it's okay to voice your opinions, no matter how ugly it is, how ugly your opinion is. And that's one of the reasons why I won't get on Instagram because I see how they treat all these other people. I see how they treat people who are just living their lives. You have people going on there commenting and making ugly statements about someone just living their lives. I will say, um, I am on Instagram religiously, but I will say as far as the Facebook, I wasn't on there as much, but now because of the political climate, I'm on there even more. And I do see myself gravitating more towards the political commentary about what's going on in our current administration. And I just like to read the comments. It's not even necessarily the story. Like I could care less. I just want to read the comments. And I will say that I'm kind of proud of, of us. Little bit as you know, Americans, because there is a lot more, um, love out there than there is hate. And those people that are spewing that hate, there's just many people. I don't know if you want to call them liberals, whatever you want to call them, but I've made comments where I'm liking stuff and I'm just like the nickname, what have you? Like there's so much more positivity than there is negativity in those comments. And that's what makes me continue to move forward because I feel like there is no, like, it's not the end. Like it gives me hope, I guess you could say. Yes, there is. I do believe that there is hope at the end of the tunnel. It's just. Get into that tunnel. Right. It is. And even the good stuff, like I don't even want to see some of this stuff, you know what I mean? And I was having dinner last week, um, with my goddaughters. Um, my sister and I both share goddaughter, like, well, we don't share goddaughters, but the sisters, there are two girls, two girls who are sisters who she and I, are godparents too. And so they cooked us dinner last weekend and we went there and we had adult conversation with other people there. And it was like talking about all the things that our new political leader is doing. And I'm just like, why? Why is he destroying this country? And that he cannot see it. But everyone says that banning. Like he's cutting things. He's banning things. He's things that are imperative to our growth, to our nation. Exactly. I just don't understand how he's able to get away with these. Like how many executive orders do you get? There should be a limit. I thought there was a limit. And I thought that, and I thought too, that executive orders were sort of temporary until it goes through Congress. I read a while ago that he's on track with about how many executive orders my president Obama gave. Well, our president, we know why he had to do his. Right. But he's on course with just as many. In this timeframe that our president Obama gave. So, I mean, I'm not going to say here or there as far as that. It's just what type of executive orders. Right. That he's giving. And I feel that, you know, back to our topic, it goes back to that, that like these people, the unknown scares people. It scares everybody. But the fact that you're using it to spew hate is what bothers me.", "segments": [{"start": 0.08, "end": 1.36, "text": " Words are very powerful.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [32857, 366, 588, 4005, 13],

Yes, they are. I mean, I think I try to make sure that when I'm upset that I try not to say something because I know even though I'm upset in that moment, if you say something to someone, you can never really take it back. You know, I mean, if you like really go in, you can never really take it back. And honestly, sometimes at the end of the day, that's not how you that's not generally how you feel. You're just angry in that moment. And words are hurtful sometimes, you know, you know, so it's so I try very hard not to go there when I'm angry, because at the end of the day, I still want to have a relationship with the person. And I think if I didn't, or if I didn't care, then I can be like, whatever, and say whatever and be let bygones be bygones. But if I care about the person, I really have to check myself in my anger, like, okay, don't say this. Try to try to make sense of where you're coming from. Like, I really try to do that. And I think I learned that also, because for my mom, my mom, when she gets angry, she says, the most foulest. Oh, so she's a Oh, yeah, she's Michelle, an adult. Very much so. And it's like the words that come out of her mouth. And you're kind of like, where in the world is this coming from? And why are you saying? I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to say that. I don't want to be like that. So that's why I'm trying to work on myself so hard now. Because I know that the things I can say can be extremely brutal and hurtful. And I know I have the capability to make someone cry. Yeah, you know, hurt somebody and devastate somebody. So yeah, like I said, that I didn't care. Now I do a lot more. Because, you know, I care about people's feelings, even though people think that I'm with this cold, heartless bitch. I mean, I care. I do care. Are you a cold, heartless bitch? I'm not, but a lot of people think I might be. I mean, I don't care that they think that, but... Yeah, so, but whatever. It is what it is. It is what it is. I don't know what... But yeah, we've all had our she-ther moment. We have, you know. And I've had my moments, too, I have to admit, where I've, you know, but I... Most of the time, I didn't care. I was like, I don't care about this relationship no more. Because I would like to hear it. Because, like, she... I don't... Since I've known her... I don't care about this relationship no more. I have yet to hear her... I've... Your sarcasticness is funny to me. But, like, you getting really angry, I'm gonna have to ask, like, one of your family members, like, can you describe a moment where... Oh, yeah. They can give you... T-Tokia has just, like, lost it on somebody completely. They can give you moments. I trust. I mean, going off, used your hands, flailing, like, the angry black woman, which is our topic for today. Kind of. Sort of. Sort of. I guess I sort of have. Maybe. Because I remember that one time your sister said something was... Because you guys were maybe in Miami or something. You guys were at a club celebrating something for someone. And this girl kept bumping into somebody or something like that. Yeah, yeah. And you were just really keeping it cool. I was. And it was your sister that eventually had to go off. Yeah, she was like... You know, certain things don't bother me. Certain things, really, I could care less or whatever. But whenever that thing is that bothers me, I will let loose. I will let it be known. I will speak about it. I will, you know, go about it. And then depending on how angry I am, you know, at the time or whatever, and if I care or not about what I'm saying, then, you know what I mean? Like, then I can let loose. But most of the time, for the most part, I am... Like, I try to handle things like... They call me the diplomatic one in the family. You are. You are very much so. You are. And I try to do that to be diplomatic. And she tries to see all sides of the story. I try. And not to any fault of her own, but she can see what everyone did wrong in each day. Different instance. I try to. Like, there was a really bad instance a couple years ago where some people that I'm no longer, you know, deal with at all. And she, you know, just gave me a play-by-play synopsis. Like, okay, this is what you could have done better. And this is what they could have done better. Right. And I was just like, you're right. You're absolutely right. There was nothing I could fault in anything that you said. I mean, but, you know, that's just... You know, and you just think about it. Like, you want... Like, I really don't like conflict, honestly. I really don't. But I'm not afraid to have to get into conflict if I have to. But the thing is, I really don't like conflict. So I try to be, like, look at things from as many perspectives as I can before I really, like, okay, you know, let it out or whatever. But, yeah. Okay. So today's topic for discussion for this episode, we're going to be discussing the angry black woman. The angry black woman. Yes. And this has been talked about forever. Yes. Stereotype typecasts, what have you. And so we just really wanted to just give our perspective on it. Yeah. And just talk about it a little bit. Yes. You know, discuss it and see, based on some of the stuff that both of us have read, just to see how we feel about it. And, you know, I mean, is it a valid stigma that's been put on black women today? Right. Is it a valid stigma? Is it a myth? Yes. Is it real? Yes. All of you both. Why is it? Yes. Why does it exist? Yes. Why does an angry black woman exist? Exactly. So, yeah. The most important thing. Right. Why does she exist if she exists? If she exists. Exactly. So, yeah. Let's talk about it. So the Urban Dictionary defines an angry black woman as a state of mind that black females can go into if given proper stimuli. This results in unpredictable behavior and usually results in violence and or chaos. So that's a problem right there. But that could be anybody. Thank you. Thank you. If anyone is given, what did it say? Put in a stimuli? Or what did that definition say? That's a what the fuck. Right. Exactly. Because if anyone is provoked. It's us. It's not. But we're not the only ones that can get provoked. Sure. Exactly. So why are we, why is it, you know. So Wikipedia had a slightly better, because they delved into the origin of it. It said an angry black woman is a derogatory term that refers to black women. It is also formulated as Sapphire or sassy black woman. The angry black woman was popularized in the 1930s radio show Amos and Andy with the character Sapphire. Her nagging, assertive demeanor and frequent emasculation of her husband has been echoed with characters such as Anastor from Sanford and Son and Pam from Martin. The angry black woman archetype has not been studied to the same degree as the Mammy and Jezebel archetypes. Scholars, they say Dion Bennett and Marcelina Morgan suggested the stereotype is less studied because researchers accept it. The stereotype of the angry mean black woman goes unnamed, not because of its insignificance, but because it's considered an essential characteristic of black femininity, regardless of the other stereotypical roles of the black woman may be accused of occupying. These stereotypes are more than representative representations. They're representations that shape realities. And I agree with that statement a hundred percent. You know, our first lady, and she's always, she's going to be my first lady for four years. Forever. Until Agent Orange is impeached. Forever. Forever and ever. And ever. The eloquent, the beautiful. Yes. Miss Michelle Obama. Absolutely. Was labeled as a black, angry black woman. And that whole I think started off the conversation because the New York Times style section from last year called her an angry black woman in a tweet. And that's what set it off. How she overcame that, you know, or what have you. This exact tweet was how Floata shed an angry black woman caricature involved into a political powerhouse. And I never, ever in my wildest dreams envisioned the first lady, Michelle Obama, as an angry black woman. No, not at all. I really don't understand where even the caricatures of it, like even when you're reading Wikipedia, it stems from characterizations of people portraying certain characters. Negative possible characteristics that aren't always, the problem I have with stereotypes in general, and I'm sure other people have regardless, especially as a black person in America as a whole. Right. Is that they make it seem like the whole entire race does this, or acts like this, or eats that, or dresses like that, or says that. Right. And that's not true. That is so not the case. So we're going to get a little political today. Just a little bit. And you're probably going to see both of our angry sides today. Right. My angry black woman. There you go. Will come out. Yes. Yes. Yes. You are great. Miss Michelle. Love it. Okay. I'm always ready. Yes. I'll give it. I will. So yeah, so the big problem I had was when I had heard that, and then she did her final interview as the, well, she's still my first lady, but we'll say technically her final interview is first lady, official first lady. Officially. She said that, you know, the big O, Miss Oprah, asked her, you know, how she felt about that. And she said that it just, it did bother her. You know, she's like, they don't even know her. Right. And she was just like, it showed her that both sides were still afraid. And that she said that it just encouraged her to live her life. More loud so that people could see her life and then judge for themselves. And I think if anyone was really watching, they did not see an angry black woman. She's been described as eloquent. She's been described as upstanding, a beautiful, strong woman. Like you see her strength very clearly without it being an overpowering thing. It's like something that just stands up in its own truth. So why? I just, I, I still don't understand like where that statement came from in regards to her being angry. Is she passionate? Absolutely. As most of us are, we are passionate individuals. So I believe that that's been misconstrued as an angry black woman. Unfortunately. Yes. I just, I feel like she was just labeled that because maybe they didn't have anything else to label her with, you know, I mean, she's a Harvard graduate and she's esteemed. She's very sophisticated and you know, she's had all these accomplishments in her life. She has two beautiful daughters that are also going to be eloquent and, you know, upright in their own lives. And I don't know if people are scared of that. Like she said, people were just afraid of each other. That is a serious possibility because you find that when people start saying things that especially aren't true, you know, or people want to find a way to label you, which, why should you even say that? Even try to label somebody. That's another thing. If you put a label on something, you feel better because you know what it is. You know what it is and you know how to deal with it. Exactly. So, and that's the problem I have. But so, you know, delving into this a little bit more because we're both two African American women, black women. Yes. And, um, you know, just to talk about this, there's so much more to cover in this. So I just want to stress that we're just covering our initial reactions to it and just having just a, a, basic conversation about it because it could be much more that we could say. Definitely. You know, bring people on and talk about, but this is just from our perspective. Absolutely. And I'm sure in future episodes we will delve into a little bit more psychologically, you know, emotionally, this, that, and the third. So this is just a surface type discussion, but I felt like we needed to have it, especially now in the climate that we're in now because everything I feel like is being misconstrued. Everyone is, is on alert and nervous and scared. Yes. And there's even more misunderstandings in the world now that there ever have been, there ever will be because of this asshole that's supposed to be running our country. And I just, and I'm, I'm sorry to say that and just be so derogatory towards him, but you know, I never, ever in a million years thought that we'd be going backward instead of moving forward. And that's exactly what's happening. Exactly. You know, it's like everyone's regressing. Everyone feels now that it's okay to voice your opinions, no matter how ugly it is, how ugly your opinion is. And that's one of the reasons why I won't get on Instagram because I see how they treat all these other people. I see how they treat people who are just living their lives. You have people going on there commenting and making ugly statements about someone just living their lives. I will say, um, I am on Instagram religiously, but I will say as far as the Facebook, I wasn't on there as much, but now because of the political climate, I'm on there even more. And I do see myself gravitating more towards the political commentary about what's going on in our current administration. And I just like to read the comments. It's not even necessarily the story. Like I could care less. I just want to read the comments. And I will say that I'm kind of proud of, of us. Little bit as you know, Americans, because there is a lot more, um, love out there than there is hate. And those people that are spewing that hate, there's just many people. I don't know if you want to call them liberals, whatever you want to call them, but I've made comments where I'm liking stuff and I'm just like the nickname, what have you? Like there's so much more positivity than there is negativity in those comments. And that's what makes me continue to move forward because I feel like there is no, like, it's not the end. Like it gives me hope, I guess you could say. Yes, there is. I do believe that there is hope at the end of the tunnel. It's just. Get into that tunnel. Right. It is. And even the good stuff, like I don't even want to see some of this stuff, you know what I mean? And I was having dinner last week, um, with my goddaughters. Um, my sister and I both share goddaughter, like, well, we don't share goddaughters, but the sisters, there are two girls, two girls who are sisters who she and I, are godparents too. And so they cooked us dinner last weekend and we went there and we had adult conversation with other people there. And it was like talking about all the things that our new political leader is doing. And I'm just like, why? Why is he destroying this country? And that he cannot see it. But everyone says that banning. Like he's cutting things. He's banning things. He's things that are imperative to our growth, to our nation. Exactly. I just don't understand how he's able to get away with these. Like how many executive orders do you get? There should be a limit. I thought there was a limit. And I thought that, and I thought too, that executive orders were sort of temporary until it goes through Congress. I read a while ago that he's on track with about how many executive orders my president Obama gave. Well, our president, we know why he had to do his. Right. But he's on course with just as many. In this timeframe that our president Obama gave. So, I mean, I'm not going to say here or there as far as that. It's just what type of executive orders. Right. That he's giving. And I feel that, you know, back to our topic, it goes back to that, that like these people, the unknown scares people. It scares everybody. But the fact that you're using it to spew hate is what bothers me.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.08, "end": 1.36, "text": " Words are very powerful.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [32857, 366, 588,
