{"text": " They were freaking the fuck out. They were on Facebook freaking out too. But yeah, it was definitely a learning experience for them. I think I saw one family. The dad just dropped off his kid at the airport to go on a trip. And his wife and one of their other kids was at the school to do with the rest of his life. Where to go with the chance that he was never going to make it to any of those three. Yeah, that's a fucked up decision to have to make in that sort of situation. Yeah, because of a shitty website. Yeah. And apparently the whole thing started because there was like a changeover in the shift of the people who manned that system. And apparently the dude pushed the wrong button twice. Yeah. Because there's a failsafe, you see. And this is what happens when you have people making sites on the cheap. For important things like, hey, we're going to tell people they're going to die in 15 minutes. The other problem was they didn't have a way to tell people that it was a false alarm. They had to add that after this. Yeah. Well, like you guys said, for 38 minutes, they were... So they had no way to do that. And Hawaii was on Twitter basically going, yeah, our bad. Yeah, the guy that created this whole thing, he's been reassigned. I should freaking hope so. And I assume they're going to be bringing somebody in to better design this whole system. Yeah. A big red confirmation box would probably be a good thing. Yeah, tell you what you're trying to confirm. That would also be a good thing when you're trying to decide. Because there's been mock-ups because they can't actually show the real thing. It would just be a potential security issue. There's potential mock-ups showing like, oh, they didn't have the buttons for these things right next to each other, potentially. Or the drop-downs. They just were not as clear on which was the drill or the test message, which was the real one, that sort of stuff. Yeah. Well, from what I saw, it was basically just one word difference. And if you weren't really looking at it, you really could make that mistake. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's the missile alert thing. I got to just click on that. Oh, wait. No. Oh, crap. Wait. No, no, no. It's like some sites where... There's a coupon for it that just loads up the site. It's like President of Platinum. It says, sorry, this coupon is expired. One of the options is no. The other one is okay. Like, what is no? What is no? No. No, it's not expired. Give it to me. Yeah. It's like, no, you're wrong. Okay. That's... You want to... Yeah. But the government being cheap is not the reason. Yeah. So, yeah. Hearts go out to our friends in Hawaii who got that shit scared out of them this week. Yeah. Yeah. A person got sent to a Fallout shelter and was also in there is Magic Johnson, Laker Grade's current owner of the... Or part owner of the Dodgers. I was like, oh, my friend just sent me a text saying he's chilling in his Fallout shelter with Magic Johnson. What? Yeah. Well... Well, that's at least a good way to go out. Yeah. I hung out with Magic Johnson and then died. Yeah. All right. I guess it's good that the aides didn't get to him first. Well... All right. Well, this next story... Goddamn. Okay. So, in California, there's this sort of fringe movement that's called the New California Movement. And basically, the idea is they want to do this thing where the rural and non-urban parts of California secede and form their own... Form basically what would form the 51st state in the Union. And it's led by this guy named Paul Preston who's like a conservative talk show host down there. And they're trying to cut out the liberal parts of the state for their own thing. Yeah. And they sort of rent their Declaration of Independence this week to a very sparsely filled conference. Crap. Yeah. I think if you're going to declare independence, it probably helps that the rest of the, you know, state would know about it. Yeah. And they've been trying to do this sort of thing for decades in California. Yeah. Obviously, to no avail. Nothing has happened. This is not going nowhere. And it's weird that this particular proposition essentially says, hey, we get San Jose, we get San Diego, we get L.A., San Francisco, and Sacramento, I think. So, like, Dan Ribb would be in the new state, I guess. Whoops. Yeah. Fresno as well. It's like, these are still kind of liberal areas. Yeah. But, like, Northern California is very heavily like a pot-making area of the state. Yeah. It's a very weird thing. It's not going to happen. At least not before Puerto Rico and D.C. become states. Yeah. Those are more likely to make the jump than this. Yeah. And the thing is, once you get down out into the rural parts of Southern California, you basically have walked into Alabama number two. Yeah. Like, there's, you know, you played Grand Theft Auto V. There's a reason once you get out into the desert areas, it's basically nothing but rednecks as far as the eye can see. Hmm. But, yeah. So, moving on. Oh, God, this one. Okay. So, a 737, I guess a 737 from Turkey, was landing in on a runway, but it skid off this runway and then ended up hanging over a sloped cliff above the Black Sea. What? Yeah, this is really crazy, especially when you first look at the image. It's like, oh, it's, that looks like it'd be okay. You realize, no, that's the size of the plane hanging across this entire stretch of cliff. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, that's fucking huge. Yeah. There's nothing about that that looks okay to me. Not okay. Initially, kind of like, oh, they just push it into the ocean and it's okay. It's going to keep floating. It's like, no, it's, luckily, everybody's. Everybody moved to the back of the plane. It's like a Simpsons thing, like one of the early Simpsons episodes. They go camping, end up almost crashing the car, driving the car over the cliff. Okay, everybody out the back slowly. They get out and the car just flops right over all their stuff. Canyon arrow. Hmm. Luckily, that didn't happen here. Everybody's okay. Okay. Seems like. Hope everybody got a refund. Yeah, I assume they get their next flight free. If they want to come back. Seems like the airstrip was icy. So they went the entire length of the runway and then slipped off right near the edge. Hmm. Well, at least nobody was hurt this time. So that's good. The weird thing is this particular airline, Pegasus, is their second ever accident in 30 years. So they got a pretty good track record. Yeah. These things don't really happen all that often. So I don't want to know what color the pilot's pants are at that at this point. Mm hmm. If you think it's bad when you try to hard break in snowy weather, this is probably way worse. Yep. Yeah. Because you got 162 people shitting their pants alongside you. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of cold, snowy weather. Ah, here's a family guy cutaway. If you think it's cold here, you should try. Boy, me a con Russia, which is, you know, there's there's a reason why the world knows about Russia winters. Hmm. They are notoriously brutal. And this one, this particular part of Russia. Oh, it's bad. Hmm. Yeah. They reached 88 degrees. This blows zero on Tuesday. Yeah. I assume Fahrenheit. Uh, they got pictures here of women with their eyelashes, uh, frozen. Yep. Which looks really cool. I obviously would not want to be out in that. No, obviously I wouldn't want to be out in that either. Uh, I was reading some about this area, uh, talking about how they had, uh, some thermometers outside. And it just ended at 50. Well, it's colder than that. Give up. Um, my, my suggestion to people living there is not to lick a pole. Just, just don't. Yeah. Uh, no, no, no. Don't go anywhere near metal. So if your eyelashes freeze, does it also also kill those little mites that live in your eyelashes? Yeah, it does. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So they had two men freeze to death. Uh, after their car broke down, they tried to walk to a nearby farm. Obviously it was not fast enough. Bad idea. Uh, yeah. So they say students routinely go to school when it's 40 below, but it was canceled when it got to 80. I should hope so. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I don't need to remind people. This is in Siberia. Yeah. It's about 3,300 miles east of Moscow. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Local officials said Tuesday that all houses were closed. Households and businesses in the region have been working, have working central heating and access to backup power generators. Yeah. So I assume that's probably mandated that every house has that stuff in order. Remember, well, back in the day, this is where Stalin would send someone to go to the gulag. That's the type of cold we're talking about here. Yeah. Um, yeah. The record for coldest, uh, temperature in a permanently inhabited settlement anywhere in the world is 89.9. So it's not too far off. Yeah. And I'm guessing that was somewhere in Russia as well. I believe so. It's not mentioned here. Yeah. Hey, if you want to write about records, you say who owns the record. Yeah. I just say it's close to this record. Who cares? Hey, somebody scored 100 points in a basketball game. That's crazy. Like, well, don't leave us hanging, man. Yeah. I remember reading like an NBA tweet. It's like, Oh, LeBron James is one of three people to ever do this. It's like, who are the other two? Yeah. What the fuck is going on? That would require research. You got 280 characters. Tell us more. Yeah. All right. So next up, we already mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating. Uh, plague is here. Uh, this winter's flu is now literally an epidemic and it has killed over a hundred people. 20 kids, 80 adults. Uh, yeah, no joke. This is nasty one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those hands, people. Yeah. Wash those hands, you know, cover your face when you sneeze. Yeah. The shit that, you know, your parents were supposed to have taught you. Yeah. But make sure you're using the, uh, the vampire cover where you, uh, put it into the crook of your arm. Yeah. Yeah. So they say the proportion of people rushing to the doctors to get treated for the flu is already hit 5.8%, which is as high as that number gets during the peak of a really bad flu season. Uh, the rate at which Americans are being hospitalized for the flu almost doubled in the last week from 22.7 for every a hundred thousand hospitalizations, uh, to 22.7. Uh, and so the CDC monitors the severity of flu season in two ways. Uh, I guess morbidly by how many people died, uh, 20 children and 101 total, uh, 101 total last season. For kids, uh, it's 20 already here. Uh, yeah. 40 million, 40 million Americans got the flu in 2014, 2015, 19 million people went to the doctor to get treated. 970,000 people were hospitalized. Uh, we're still slightly below that rate, but it's not that far off, but the main reason the flu appears to be so severe. It's a strain known as H3N2, which tends to make people more sick. The flu tend to get sicker. It's especially dangerous for children and the elderly. Uh, yeah, the vaccine may only be about 30% effective against the strain. It's better than 10% effectiveness reported in Australia as it's flu season for the United States because their winter is in the summer here. Uh, US often see, yeah, they use that to try to predict what happens here. Uh, yeah, telling people to go to the doctor to get vaccinated. Uh, yep. Yeah. Make sure you ask anybody that's sneezing if they got the flu. They do. Tell them to go fuck off. Yeah. Yeah. Or set them on fire, you know? Yeah. And I've only ever gotten the flu like once or twice. One time it was because I was around my dad. He had it and he didn't tell me. Yeah. So I started vomiting. I was like, what the fuck? What did I eat? It's like, no. Your father had the flu. He didn't tell you. Well, I think they're actually referring to, um, uh, respiratory influenza here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Now the, the stomach flu or, um, gastroenteritis, that's,", "segments": [{"start": 0.94, "end": 2.88, "text": " They were freaking", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [814, 645, 14612], "temperature": 0.0,

They were on Facebook freaking out too. But yeah, it was definitely a learning experience for them. I think I saw one family. The dad just dropped off his kid at the airport to go on a trip. And his wife and one of their other kids was at the school to do with the rest of his life. Where to go with the chance that he was never going to make it to any of those three. Yeah, that's a fucked up decision to have to make in that sort of situation. Yeah, because of a shitty website. Yeah. And apparently the whole thing started because there was like a changeover in the shift of the people who manned that system. And apparently the dude pushed the wrong button twice. Yeah. Because there's a failsafe, you see. And this is what happens when you have people making sites on the cheap. For important things like, hey, we're going to tell people they're going to die in 15 minutes. The other problem was they didn't have a way to tell people that it was a false alarm. They had to add that after this. Yeah. Well, like you guys said, for 38 minutes, they were... So they had no way to do that. And Hawaii was on Twitter basically going, yeah, our bad. Yeah, the guy that created this whole thing, he's been reassigned. I should freaking hope so. And I assume they're going to be bringing somebody in to better design this whole system. Yeah. A big red confirmation box would probably be a good thing. Yeah, tell you what you're trying to confirm. That would also be a good thing when you're trying to decide. Because there's been mock-ups because they can't actually show the real thing. It would just be a potential security issue. There's potential mock-ups showing like, oh, they didn't have the buttons for these things right next to each other, potentially. Or the drop-downs. They just were not as clear on which was the drill or the test message, which was the real one, that sort of stuff. Yeah. Well, from what I saw, it was basically just one word difference. And if you weren't really looking at it, you really could make that mistake. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's the missile alert thing. I got to just click on that. Oh, wait. No. Oh, crap. Wait. No, no, no. It's like some sites where... There's a coupon for it that just loads up the site. It's like President of Platinum. It says, sorry, this coupon is expired. One of the options is no. The other one is okay. Like, what is no? What is no? No. No, it's not expired. Give it to me. Yeah. It's like, no, you're wrong. Okay. That's... You want to... Yeah. But the government being cheap is not the reason. Yeah. So, yeah. Hearts go out to our friends in Hawaii who got that shit scared out of them this week. Yeah. Yeah. A person got sent to a Fallout shelter and was also in there is Magic Johnson, Laker Grade's current owner of the... Or part owner of the Dodgers. I was like, oh, my friend just sent me a text saying he's chilling in his Fallout shelter with Magic Johnson. What? Yeah. Well... Well, that's at least a good way to go out. Yeah. I hung out with Magic Johnson and then died. Yeah. All right. I guess it's good that the aides didn't get to him first. Well... All right. Well, this next story... Goddamn. Okay. So, in California, there's this sort of fringe movement that's called the New California Movement. And basically, the idea is they want to do this thing where the rural and non-urban parts of California secede and form their own... Form basically what would form the 51st state in the Union. And it's led by this guy named Paul Preston who's like a conservative talk show host down there. And they're trying to cut out the liberal parts of the state for their own thing. Yeah. And they sort of rent their Declaration of Independence this week to a very sparsely filled conference. Crap. Yeah. I think if you're going to declare independence, it probably helps that the rest of the, you know, state would know about it. Yeah. And they've been trying to do this sort of thing for decades in California. Yeah. Obviously, to no avail. Nothing has happened. This is not going nowhere. And it's weird that this particular proposition essentially says, hey, we get San Jose, we get San Diego, we get L.A., San Francisco, and Sacramento, I think. So, like, Dan Ribb would be in the new state, I guess. Whoops. Yeah. Fresno as well. It's like, these are still kind of liberal areas. Yeah. But, like, Northern California is very heavily like a pot-making area of the state. Yeah. It's a very weird thing. It's not going to happen. At least not before Puerto Rico and D.C. become states. Yeah. Those are more likely to make the jump than this. Yeah. And the thing is, once you get down out into the rural parts of Southern California, you basically have walked into Alabama number two. Yeah. Like, there's, you know, you played Grand Theft Auto V. There's a reason once you get out into the desert areas, it's basically nothing but rednecks as far as the eye can see. Hmm. But, yeah. So, moving on. Oh, God, this one. Okay. So, a 737, I guess a 737 from Turkey, was landing in on a runway, but it skid off this runway and then ended up hanging over a sloped cliff above the Black Sea. What? Yeah, this is really crazy, especially when you first look at the image. It's like, oh, it's, that looks like it'd be okay. You realize, no, that's the size of the plane hanging across this entire stretch of cliff. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, that's fucking huge. Yeah. There's nothing about that that looks okay to me. Not okay. Initially, kind of like, oh, they just push it into the ocean and it's okay. It's going to keep floating. It's like, no, it's, luckily, everybody's. Everybody moved to the back of the plane. It's like a Simpsons thing, like one of the early Simpsons episodes. They go camping, end up almost crashing the car, driving the car over the cliff. Okay, everybody out the back slowly. They get out and the car just flops right over all their stuff. Canyon arrow. Hmm. Luckily, that didn't happen here. Everybody's okay. Okay. Seems like. Hope everybody got a refund. Yeah, I assume they get their next flight free. If they want to come back. Seems like the airstrip was icy. So they went the entire length of the runway and then slipped off right near the edge. Hmm. Well, at least nobody was hurt this time. So that's good. The weird thing is this particular airline, Pegasus, is their second ever accident in 30 years. So they got a pretty good track record. Yeah. These things don't really happen all that often. So I don't want to know what color the pilot's pants are at that at this point. Mm hmm. If you think it's bad when you try to hard break in snowy weather, this is probably way worse. Yep. Yeah. Because you got 162 people shitting their pants alongside you. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of cold, snowy weather. Ah, here's a family guy cutaway. If you think it's cold here, you should try. Boy, me a con Russia, which is, you know, there's there's a reason why the world knows about Russia winters. Hmm. They are notoriously brutal. And this one, this particular part of Russia. Oh, it's bad. Hmm. Yeah. They reached 88 degrees. This blows zero on Tuesday. Yeah. I assume Fahrenheit. Uh, they got pictures here of women with their eyelashes, uh, frozen. Yep. Which looks really cool. I obviously would not want to be out in that. No, obviously I wouldn't want to be out in that either. Uh, I was reading some about this area, uh, talking about how they had, uh, some thermometers outside. And it just ended at 50. Well, it's colder than that. Give up. Um, my, my suggestion to people living there is not to lick a pole. Just, just don't. Yeah. Uh, no, no, no. Don't go anywhere near metal. So if your eyelashes freeze, does it also also kill those little mites that live in your eyelashes? Yeah, it does. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So they had two men freeze to death. Uh, after their car broke down, they tried to walk to a nearby farm. Obviously it was not fast enough. Bad idea. Uh, yeah. So they say students routinely go to school when it's 40 below, but it was canceled when it got to 80. I should hope so. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I don't need to remind people. This is in Siberia. Yeah. It's about 3,300 miles east of Moscow. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Local officials said Tuesday that all houses were closed. Households and businesses in the region have been working, have working central heating and access to backup power generators. Yeah. So I assume that's probably mandated that every house has that stuff in order. Remember, well, back in the day, this is where Stalin would send someone to go to the gulag. That's the type of cold we're talking about here. Yeah. Um, yeah. The record for coldest, uh, temperature in a permanently inhabited settlement anywhere in the world is 89.9. So it's not too far off. Yeah. And I'm guessing that was somewhere in Russia as well. I believe so. It's not mentioned here. Yeah. Hey, if you want to write about records, you say who owns the record. Yeah. I just say it's close to this record. Who cares? Hey, somebody scored 100 points in a basketball game. That's crazy. Like, well, don't leave us hanging, man. Yeah. I remember reading like an NBA tweet. It's like, Oh, LeBron James is one of three people to ever do this. It's like, who are the other two? Yeah. What the fuck is going on? That would require research. You got 280 characters. Tell us more. Yeah. All right. So next up, we already mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating. Uh, plague is here. Uh, this winter's flu is now literally an epidemic and it has killed over a hundred people. 20 kids, 80 adults. Uh, yeah, no joke. This is nasty one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those hands, people. Yeah. Wash those hands, you know, cover your face when you sneeze. Yeah. The shit that, you know, your parents were supposed to have taught you. Yeah. But make sure you're using the, uh, the vampire cover where you, uh, put it into the crook of your arm. Yeah. Yeah. So they say the proportion of people rushing to the doctors to get treated for the flu is already hit 5.8%, which is as high as that number gets during the peak of a really bad flu season. Uh, the rate at which Americans are being hospitalized for the flu almost doubled in the last week from 22.7 for every a hundred thousand hospitalizations, uh, to 22.7. Uh, and so the CDC monitors the severity of flu season in two ways. Uh, I guess morbidly by how many people died, uh, 20 children and 101 total, uh, 101 total last season. For kids, uh, it's 20 already here. Uh, yeah. 40 million, 40 million Americans got the flu in 2014, 2015, 19 million people went to the doctor to get treated. 970,000 people were hospitalized. Uh, we're still slightly below that rate, but it's not that far off, but the main reason the flu appears to be so severe. It's a strain known as H3N2, which tends to make people more sick. The flu tend to get sicker. It's especially dangerous for children and the elderly. Uh, yeah, the vaccine may only be about 30% effective against the strain. It's better than 10% effectiveness reported in Australia as it's flu season for the United States because their winter is in the summer here. Uh, US often see, yeah, they use that to try to predict what happens here. Uh, yeah, telling people to go to the doctor to get vaccinated. Uh, yep. Yeah. Make sure you ask anybody that's sneezing if they got the flu. They do. Tell them to go fuck off. Yeah. Yeah. Or set them on fire, you know? Yeah. And I've only ever gotten the flu like once or twice. One time it was because I was around my dad. He had it and he didn't tell me. Yeah. So I started vomiting. I was like, what the fuck? What did I eat? It's like, no. Your father had the flu. He didn't tell you. Well, I think they're actually referring to, um, uh, respiratory influenza here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
