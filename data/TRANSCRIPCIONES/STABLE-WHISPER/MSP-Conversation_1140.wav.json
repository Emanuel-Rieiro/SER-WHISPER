{"text": " So Reagan was trying to do, to beef up our nuclear capabilities in an effort to, well, in an effort to have or to frighten or to heighten the Cold War with the USSR. Now, that is a major difference because Donald is in bed with Putin. But, you know, right, that was one of the only, I mean, there's so many similarities. Reagan wanted to deregulate and, you know, talk about we need to have the special task force and we need to look at deregulation, which, of course, Trump was saying for every one regulation, we need to get rid of two. Just, you know, the trickle down economics, help the rich, hurt the poor, and eventually trickle down to the poor, just so much. The difference is Reagan was an actor, which Donald is too, but Reagan was much better at it. He was considered the great communicator, you know, and he had some political experience. And at least he was the governor of the largest state, one of the largest states in the country. But Donald is just not as good at communicating. It's not his gift. It really is not. Wrong! Like, I, his tweets, as someone who has a very critical eye when it comes to writing, it's just part of my job. I feel like I'm always grading papers, you know, every time I read something. And his tweets send me into, like, convulsions. Just the way, they're written exactly the way he talks, and I just can't. Like, you are so bad at words. Please stop. Just get a publicist. My favorite, oh, he wouldn't care. He's still gonna do it his way. Of course. Because remember one of the songs that he danced at his inauguration was My Way. Absurd. The Frank Sinatra standard. My favorite is he tweets that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. He didn't mean wiretapped. I know! I was like... He didn't mean wiretapped just because he said wiretapped the phones. Spicy, who's my favorite press secretary ever in life. And he didn't mean Obama specifically. He meant the administration, even though he specifically called Obama a bad guy. Absolutely. Have you ever seen with Saturday Night Live, just Spicy or Sean Spicer? Yes, Melissa McCarthy. She's a genius. She is hilarious. And so when Spicy comes out two weeks ago and says, well, the president's tweet speaks for itself. Okay, wiretapping. Obama. All right, we got it. Check. Well, then two weeks later, with the FBI and everybody is saying, this nigga's crazy. He says... He didn't mean wiretapping. Well, he didn't mean wiretapping. That's why he put, quote, wiretapping. He meant this. He meant that. And the American people... And I was just like, oh, my God. Y'all just love... I mean, forget revisionist history. Like, you revise... I guess yesterday is history, but you revise things while... Right. Like, while they're happening, you're just like, nah, that's not what happened because we changed our minds. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I just wonder, like, if you're Spicy... Like, I know you guys do your job, and all of us have had jobs. We have to do stuff that we don't necessarily agree with. Like, understand sometimes. Sometimes you gotta go do something, and you're like, this is stupid. Right. Like, I wonder, what is the pep talk he has to give himself? He's in the mirror beforehand, like, come on, Spicy. Right. Listen. What type of alcohol is in his coffee? But he's like, let me go make this money. Let me go make this money. I hope. I hope that that's the case. And it's not like he genuinely means what he means. That's what he says. Because that's what's more disturbing. Like, are you for real? Like... I think he's just... He gets told what to say, and he's an actor. You have to be. Because we're watching this like, you're a fool, poor thing. And so, if you're doing it for the money, then I mean, more power to you. If you actually believe the hype, then you need to go talk to my parents. She'll help you. You're specifically? And give a recommendation. Because she offers a level of truth that I think you need. Just like when, you know, what was it a couple weeks ago when the president used a word in his tweet, but then Spicer was like, no, no, no. That's not what he meant. I can't remember the word now. You know what? I don't remember either. But I've been following Merriam-Webster dictionary because they cannot stop trolling him, and it is hilarious. Like, it's the best. The official Merriam-Webster dictionary account. Every day, like when they choose their word of the day, it's trending because it's based on something he said. They do such a good job. It's hilarious. I remember the word of the year last year was xenophobic. Yeah. Because you had a lot of people that were like, what in the world is a xeno? Oh, it's not even starting with a z. Okay, look at that. Yo, you learn something new every day, don't you know? They are killing it. You've got to follow them. I love it. I gotta do it. I might follow them on Twitter. I used to on Twitter for the word of the day. So that's pretty awesome. Let's see. There's some other stuff that we haven't addressed that I know you're going to be so excited to address. What's this? I think you're being sarcastic. Oh, I say it in all sarcasm. Oh, man. I said excited, but I didn't mean excited. What I meant was... What I meant was excited in reverse. Reverse excited. Excitement. That's why I put the quote. Check. I didn't see the quotes. My bad. Okay. Okay. Because I didn't. I may or may not have used the quotes. Oh, shoot. I deleted the tweet, so you'll never know, right? The first is there is a quote unquote beef between Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma. I read about that today, actually. You know I'm not I barely keep up with the pop culture you asked me to keep up with. So the fact that I even know about this is impressive. But it's only because it came directly to my inbox as part of my like a newsletter for something I follow. Here's a reality that some of our dear listeners may be offended by. I cannot name two Remy Ma or Nicki Minaj songs to save my life. I mean, I know exactly who Nicki Minaj is. Now I know who Remy Ma look well, at least what she looks like. I didn't know what she looked like before. I knew her name. Aside. I didn't. Right. Yeah. Aside from those two facts. And I even have a Nicki Minaj album like on saved in my Spotify because when it came out, I listened to it and I was like, all right, this is cool. But again, cannot name. Okay. I just thought of lyric, but I can't name. I can't say it on the podcast because it's high noon. I have to tell you that I can pretty much rap about 45 Nicki Minaj verses, if you would like. I don't want to admit that. I love it. But I do know a lot of Nicki Minaj lyrics. So that part I knew. The lyrics, I'm all, I mean, I just, I, I just think that these pseudo rap beefs are one orchestrated and are two so stupid. Like nobody buys albums hardly anymore. So we have to figure out some way to keep people popular, to keep people famous, to keep people relevant. Yeah. And relevant. Right. And so it's just like, you know, and I listened to these verses that were these songs that people, that they were talking about one another. And afterwards I was like, okay, that's about 12 minutes of my life. I will never get back. And the funny thing is that people on social media are going so hard for team Nicki or team Remy. Well. And I'm just like. Let me offer another position because first of all, I don't care, but let me offer another position. And this is not my position. This is the position presented to me in the, in my inbox today. So. What type of PhD? This wasn't. It's from my feminist panties. So when you get. Did you clutch your pearls? Oh, my pearls. Anytime you get to talk about panties. Feminist panties. Well, I get these awesome panties that I'm not even going to plug, but they're so cool. But they send this week in feminism newsletters out every week. Once you've bought these feminist panties. And so. Do they say stuff on them? You clutch your pearls. Do they say stuff on the panties? There's nothing on the panties. There's no words? No, there's no words. It's just the philosophy behind them and the purpose they serve. But I won't say more things to make you clutch your pearls. So. Now intrigued. Panties, what? I know. I just love panties. I have an underwear thing. Well, they sent, it was on this week in feminism. They sent their, their take on the beef, which I thought was interesting that they even addressed it. But they talked about, you know, how rap is a male dominated field. And there are always beefs between rap artists. And it's always these dudes. And suddenly these women are in the spotlight having a real beef. And it's not about, you know, they use that, that quote from, who's the chick's name, who I can't, I'm not going to try to say out loud. So I don't mispronounce it on podcast and sound stupid. But you know, the, the very popular feminist who Beyonce had on her album. And they talked about how women should be encouraged to compete for, not for men or whatever, but for success and all that. Anyway, they use that. And they talked about how the two of them are competing to be, you know, the rap queen or whatever. And that's, that's the kind of, that's the kind of beef and that's the kind of competition women should be engaging in. And that, you know, they're relevant and people are paying attention and people care. And for once it's women in hip hop, which is rare. So that was kind of their stance on it. Interesting. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. But I still don't care, but I thought it was interesting that they had a take on it. And of course that is a part of rap. Beefy. Is that, well, I mean, I think that's a part of being like black. Right. Like that's who we are. So we don't sit around and encourage each other all the time. Sometimes we sit around and talk trash to each other. All in good fun. All in love. If you ever Google feminist panties, I just want you to know. What comes up? Why are you Googling it? I could have given you more details if you wanted so that you didn't have to arbitrarily Google. Google feminist panties. There are some panties that have come up. And. One of them. Oh my God. This. I'm sorry. I've never Googled feminist panties. So I don't know what you're finding. Oh my God. There is. It's taking me back to biology. One Oh two. Was it one Oh two? No. Two forty at the University of Louisville required of all pre-med majors. And it is literally the graphic of the vagina that has been screen printed onto the panties. And with labels. Fallopian tube. Ovary. Uterus. Cervix. Vagina. There you go. For anyone who was curious. Those are not the panties to which I'm referring. But that is interesting. Absolutely. Oh, but I have a problem because they only make them small and medium. That's a problem. Because that will not work for yours truly. So moving on from that. It won't work for me either. It makes me think of that time that Sean was on the show and I said something like about me wearing makeup. And leggings. And he was like. Right. Leggings. And he was like. What? He wears makeup? You wear makeup? He wears makeup? And I was like. Because we both like laughed about it. You said. I was like. You look good without your makeup. And he was like. You like. Thank you. And he was like. Wait. Do you wear makeup sometimes? And then the same thing happened again like that. He did. You're like. No. I don't. Right. And I can't wear these feminist panties because they are. Well, it says they come in two sizes. Small. Medium. And large. Extra large. Well. Okay. I need a little bit. You need something for the fluffy girl. I love that term. I love it. I do too. It makes me think of. Because, you know, fluffy is so good. All the things that I like. There's so many things I love that are fluffy. Absolutely. That's it. Absolutely. So. But. Make. Okay. I know we're all over the place. But it's my fault. I'm supposed to be steering this ship. And you're just letting it. Sometimes. Just go willy nilly. You don't have the steering wheel in your hand. Sometimes the ADD just takes over. But talking about that beef between Remy Ma and Nicki Minaj. Which, again, I don't think is a real beef. It's manufactured beef. It is a rap beef. And it's to promote. And if anybody does still buy albums, people who are diehard will buy those particular people. I don't. I just buy. I have Spotify title. And Apple Music. I'm going to get rid of two of them. I just haven't yet. Evidently, I think I'm rich. I need all the music platforms. I know. Well, because Prince was only on title. And then Apple Music was free. And I just never canceled it. And I already had Spotify with all of my playlists. And, you know, like, I've been invested in that for so long. So, anyway, don't judge me. Um, so talking about that beef, the Roots. I forgot who it was. I sent you the article, but I don't remember who it was. Brought up the old Foxy Brown. You did send it to me. And Queen Latifah beef, which made me think about that listener that Mikaika gave such a hard time to. Yes, I did. Absolutely. It was me. Absolutely. I'm the good one. And I was like, oh, so we owe him. Um, an apology. Kind of. Back because of this beef. Because he, he talked about it literally 10 years late, but yet was a month early when it resurfaced. He's like, profit. Right. That is. That's the prophetic stuff. So, I feel like I need to, like, ask his permission before we ever use his name. Probably. But, you know, big ups to our friend from DuPont Manuel High School who listens and who was our profit. So. I keep waiting. I keep waiting for, like, a hate message. Like, why y'all talk so bad about me? But I guess he doesn't care. Or he stopped, or he stopped listening. He's like, you know what? Them fools. You better not stop listening because we will find you. We will find you. So, while we're on, while we're on the petty train, picture it. Real Housewives of Atlanta, your other favorite train. My favorite. I love it. There has been some petty, petty, petty beef between this fine Portia Williams. Who is? She's just gorgeous. But pretty much that's where it ends. No other attributes to compliment. Because the other day she was going, she was going out of the country to Hawaii. And I thought, oh, well. Kind of, sort of, maybe not. She meant the continental U.S. But, you know, she was the one who thought the Underground Railroad was a train that went around picking up. Stop. I will hang up right now. She absolutely did. She, this was a few years ago. She wanted to know where the trains were. Where, where the railroad was. Because, you know, you got to pick up those slaves and get them to freedom. And so, in her defense, some slaves did jump on to railroads. So, cars. In her defense. But, anyway. On the show, the mogul who's in Escape, which is exciting because Escape is getting back together. Yay. To come out with a new album. But, anyway. So, Kandi Burris, who's in Escape, she accused Kandi of being this lesbian. Long story short, they both kind of lesbianized each other a little bit. You know, kissed. And it's just the biggest mess where people lie about people make up stuff about other people when, in fact, they themselves get down. I kind of hate that. I kind of hate when people accuse other people being gay, homosexual, lesbianic, or whatever. And they themselves, you know, participate in same gender loving rituals. And that's kind of what happened. And it's just real messy and real crazy. And people are arguing and fighting in the last couple of weeks of the show. And Black Twitter, of course, is choosing sides. I feel like there's always this push for our community to pick sides. You know? Like, to kind of pick. Who are you going to be? Are you going to be team this? The internet has to do that. Or are you going to be team that? Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't get it. And it's just... Like, who even cares? But that's ratings. I mean, that's... You get Twitter interested. You get people picking sides. You got people watching. So, more power to them. I guess they're doing what they do.

to beef up our nuclear capabilities in an effort to, well, in an effort to have or to frighten or to heighten the Cold War with the USSR. Now, that is a major difference because Donald is in bed with Putin. But, you know, right, that was one of the only, I mean, there's so many similarities. Reagan wanted to deregulate and, you know, talk about we need to have the special task force and we need to look at deregulation, which, of course, Trump was saying for every one regulation, we need to get rid of two. Just, you know, the trickle down economics, help the rich, hurt the poor, and eventually trickle down to the poor, just so much. The difference is Reagan was an actor, which Donald is too, but Reagan was much better at it. He was considered the great communicator, you know, and he had some political experience. And at least he was the governor of the largest state, one of the largest states in the country. But Donald is just not as good at communicating. It's not his gift. It really is not. Wrong! Like, I, his tweets, as someone who has a very critical eye when it comes to writing, it's just part of my job. I feel like I'm always grading papers, you know, every time I read something. And his tweets send me into, like, convulsions. Just the way, they're written exactly the way he talks, and I just can't. Like, you are so bad at words. Please stop. Just get a publicist. My favorite, oh, he wouldn't care. He's still gonna do it his way. Of course. Because remember one of the songs that he danced at his inauguration was My Way. Absurd. The Frank Sinatra standard. My favorite is he tweets that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. He didn't mean wiretapped. I know! I was like... He didn't mean wiretapped just because he said wiretapped the phones. Spicy, who's my favorite press secretary ever in life. And he didn't mean Obama specifically. He meant the administration, even though he specifically called Obama a bad guy. Absolutely. Have you ever seen with Saturday Night Live, just Spicy or Sean Spicer? Yes, Melissa McCarthy. She's a genius. She is hilarious. And so when Spicy comes out two weeks ago and says, well, the president's tweet speaks for itself. Okay, wiretapping. Obama. All right, we got it. Check. Well, then two weeks later, with the FBI and everybody is saying, this nigga's crazy. He says... He didn't mean wiretapping. Well, he didn't mean wiretapping. That's why he put, quote, wiretapping. He meant this. He meant that. And the American people... And I was just like, oh, my God. Y'all just love... I mean, forget revisionist history. Like, you revise... I guess yesterday is history, but you revise things while... Right. Like, while they're happening, you're just like, nah, that's not what happened because we changed our minds. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I just wonder, like, if you're Spicy... Like, I know you guys do your job, and all of us have had jobs. We have to do stuff that we don't necessarily agree with. Like, understand sometimes. Sometimes you gotta go do something, and you're like, this is stupid. Right. Like, I wonder, what is the pep talk he has to give himself? He's in the mirror beforehand, like, come on, Spicy. Right. Listen. What type of alcohol is in his coffee? But he's like, let me go make this money. Let me go make this money. I hope. I hope that that's the case. And it's not like he genuinely means what he means. That's what he says. Because that's what's more disturbing. Like, are you for real? Like... I think he's just... He gets told what to say, and he's an actor. You have to be. Because we're watching this like, you're a fool, poor thing. And so, if you're doing it for the money, then I mean, more power to you. If you actually believe the hype, then you need to go talk to my parents. She'll help you. You're specifically? And give a recommendation. Because she offers a level of truth that I think you need. Just like when, you know, what was it a couple weeks ago when the president used a word in his tweet, but then Spicer was like, no, no, no. That's not what he meant. I can't remember the word now. You know what? I don't remember either. But I've been following Merriam-Webster dictionary because they cannot stop trolling him, and it is hilarious. Like, it's the best. The official Merriam-Webster dictionary account. Every day, like when they choose their word of the day, it's trending because it's based on something he said. They do such a good job. It's hilarious. I remember the word of the year last year was xenophobic. Yeah. Because you had a lot of people that were like, what in the world is a xeno? Oh, it's not even starting with a z. Okay, look at that. Yo, you learn something new every day, don't you know? They are killing it. You've got to follow them. I love it. I gotta do it. I might follow them on Twitter. I used to on Twitter for the word of the day. So that's pretty awesome. Let's see. There's some other stuff that we haven't addressed that I know you're going to be so excited to address. What's this? I think you're being sarcastic. Oh, I say it in all sarcasm. Oh, man. I said excited, but I didn't mean excited. What I meant was... What I meant was excited in reverse. Reverse excited. Excitement. That's why I put the quote. Check. I didn't see the quotes. My bad. Okay. Okay. Because I didn't. I may or may not have used the quotes. Oh, shoot. I deleted the tweet, so you'll never know, right? The first is there is a quote unquote beef between Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma. I read about that today, actually. You know I'm not I barely keep up with the pop culture you asked me to keep up with. So the fact that I even know about this is impressive. But it's only because it came directly to my inbox as part of my like a newsletter for something I follow. Here's a reality that some of our dear listeners may be offended by. I cannot name two Remy Ma or Nicki Minaj songs to save my life. I mean, I know exactly who Nicki Minaj is. Now I know who Remy Ma look well, at least what she looks like. I didn't know what she looked like before. I knew her name. Aside. I didn't. Right. Yeah. Aside from those two facts. And I even have a Nicki Minaj album like on saved in my Spotify because when it came out, I listened to it and I was like, all right, this is cool. But again, cannot name. Okay. I just thought of lyric, but I can't name. I can't say it on the podcast because it's high noon. I have to tell you that I can pretty much rap about 45 Nicki Minaj verses, if you would like. I don't want to admit that. I love it. But I do know a lot of Nicki Minaj lyrics. So that part I knew. The lyrics, I'm all, I mean, I just, I, I just think that these pseudo rap beefs are one orchestrated and are two so stupid. Like nobody buys albums hardly anymore. So we have to figure out some way to keep people popular, to keep people famous, to keep people relevant. Yeah. And relevant. Right. And so it's just like, you know, and I listened to these verses that were these songs that people, that they were talking about one another. And afterwards I was like, okay, that's about 12 minutes of my life. I will never get back. And the funny thing is that people on social media are going so hard for team Nicki or team Remy. Well. And I'm just like. Let me offer another position because first of all, I don't care, but let me offer another position. And this is not my position. This is the position presented to me in the, in my inbox today. So. What type of PhD? This wasn't. It's from my feminist panties. So when you get. Did you clutch your pearls? Oh, my pearls. Anytime you get to talk about panties. Feminist panties. Well, I get these awesome panties that I'm not even going to plug, but they're so cool. But they send this week in feminism newsletters out every week. Once you've bought these feminist panties. And so. Do they say stuff on them? You clutch your pearls. Do they say stuff on the panties? There's nothing on the panties. There's no words? No, there's no words. It's just the philosophy behind them and the purpose they serve. But I won't say more things to make you clutch your pearls. So. Now intrigued. Panties, what? I know. I just love panties. I have an underwear thing. Well, they sent, it was on this week in feminism. They sent their, their take on the beef, which I thought was interesting that they even addressed it. But they talked about, you know, how rap is a male dominated field. And there are always beefs between rap artists. And it's always these dudes. And suddenly these women are in the spotlight having a real beef. And it's not about, you know, they use that, that quote from, who's the chick's name, who I can't, I'm not going to try to say out loud. So I don't mispronounce it on podcast and sound stupid. But you know, the, the very popular feminist who Beyonce had on her album. And they talked about how women should be encouraged to compete for, not for men or whatever, but for success and all that. Anyway, they use that. And they talked about how the two of them are competing to be, you know, the rap queen or whatever. And that's, that's the kind of, that's the kind of beef and that's the kind of competition women should be engaging in. And that, you know, they're relevant and people are paying attention and people care. And for once it's women in hip hop, which is rare. So that was kind of their stance on it. Interesting. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. But I still don't care, but I thought it was interesting that they had a take on it. And of course that is a part of rap. Beefy. Is that, well, I mean, I think that's a part of being like black. Right. Like that's who we are. So we don't sit around and encourage each other all the time. Sometimes we sit around and talk trash to each other. All in good fun. All in love. If you ever Google feminist panties, I just want you to know. What comes up? Why are you Googling it? I could have given you more details if you wanted so that you didn't have to arbitrarily Google. Google feminist panties. There are some panties that have come up. And. One of them. Oh my God. This. I'm sorry. I've never Googled feminist panties. So I don't know what you're finding. Oh my God. There is. It's taking me back to biology. One Oh two. Was it one Oh two? No. Two forty at the University of Louisville required of all pre-med majors. And it is literally the graphic of the vagina that has been screen printed onto the panties. And with labels. Fallopian tube. Ovary. Uterus. Cervix. Vagina. There you go. For anyone who was curious. Those are not the panties to which I'm referring. But that is interesting. Absolutely. Oh, but I have a problem because they only make them small and medium. That's a problem. Because that will not work for yours truly. So moving on from that. It won't work for me either. It makes me think of that time that Sean was on the show and I said something like about me wearing makeup. And leggings. And he was like. Right. Leggings. And he was like. What? He wears makeup? You wear makeup? He wears makeup? And I was like. Because we both like laughed about it. You said. I was like. You look good without your makeup. And he was like. You like. Thank you. And he was like. Wait. Do you wear makeup sometimes? And then the same thing happened again like that. He did. You're like. No. I don't. Right. And I can't wear these feminist panties because they are. Well, it says they come in two sizes. Small. Medium. And large. Extra large. Well. Okay. I need a little bit. You need something for the fluffy girl. I love that term. I love it. I do too. It makes me think of. Because, you know, fluffy is so good. All the things that I like. There's so many things I love that are fluffy. Absolutely. That's it. Absolutely. So. But. Make. Okay. I know we're all over the place. But it's my fault. I'm supposed to be steering this ship. And you're just letting it. Sometimes. Just go willy nilly. You don't have the steering wheel in your hand. Sometimes the ADD just takes over. But talking about that beef between Remy Ma and Nicki Minaj. Which, again, I don't think is a real beef. It's manufactured beef. It is a rap beef. And it's to promote. And if anybody does still buy albums, people who are diehard will buy those particular people. I don't. I just buy. I have Spotify title. And Apple Music. I'm going to get rid of two of them. I just haven't yet. Evidently, I think I'm rich. I need all the music platforms. I know. Well, because Prince was only on title. And then Apple Music was free. And I just never canceled it. And I already had Spotify with all of my playlists. And, you know, like, I've been invested in that for so long. So, anyway, don't judge me. Um, so talking about that beef, the Roots. I forgot who it was. I sent you the article, but I don't remember who it was. Brought up the old Foxy Brown. You did send it to me. And Queen Latifah beef, which made me think about that listener that Mikaika gave such a hard time to. Yes, I did. Absolutely. It was me. Absolutely. I'm the good one. And I was like, oh, so we owe him. Um, an apology. Kind of. Back because of this beef. Because he, he talked about it literally 10 years late, but yet was a month early when it resurfaced. He's like, profit. Right. That is. That's the prophetic stuff. So, I feel like I need to, like, ask his permission before we ever use his name. Probably. But, you know, big ups to our friend from DuPont Manuel High School who listens and who was our profit. So. I keep waiting. I keep waiting for, like, a hate message. Like, why y'all talk so bad about me? But I guess he doesn't care. Or he stopped, or he stopped listening. He's like, you know what? Them fools. You better not stop listening because we will find you. We will find you. So, while we're on, while we're on the petty train, picture it. Real Housewives of Atlanta, your other favorite train. My favorite. I love it. There has been some petty, petty, petty beef between this fine Portia Williams. Who is? She's just gorgeous. But pretty much that's where it ends. No other attributes to compliment. Because the other day she was going, she was going out of the country to Hawaii. And I thought, oh, well. Kind of, sort of, maybe not. She meant the continental U.S. But, you know, she was the one who thought the Underground Railroad was a train that went around picking up. Stop. I will hang up right now. She absolutely did. She, this was a few years ago. She wanted to know where the trains were. Where, where the railroad was. Because, you know, you got to pick up those slaves and get them to freedom. And so, in her defense, some slaves did jump on to railroads. So, cars. In her defense. But, anyway. On the show, the mogul who's in Escape, which is exciting because Escape is getting back together. Yay. To come out with a new album. But, anyway. So, Kandi Burris, who's in Escape, she accused Kandi of being this lesbian. Long story short, they both kind of lesbianized each other a little bit. You know, kissed. And it's just the biggest mess where people lie about people make up stuff about other people when, in fact, they themselves get down. I kind of hate that. I kind of hate when people accuse other people being gay, homosexual, lesbianic, or whatever. And they themselves, you know, participate in same gender loving rituals. And that's kind of what happened. And it's just real messy and real crazy. And people are arguing and fighting in the last couple of weeks of the show. And Black Twitter, of course, is choosing sides. I feel like there's always this push for our community to pick sides. You know? Like, to kind of pick. Who are you going to be? Are you going to be team this? The internet has to do that. Or are you going to be team that? Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't get it. And it's just... Like, who even cares? But that's ratings. I mean, that's... You get Twitter interested. You get people picking sides. You got people watching. So, more power to them. I guess they're doing what they do.
