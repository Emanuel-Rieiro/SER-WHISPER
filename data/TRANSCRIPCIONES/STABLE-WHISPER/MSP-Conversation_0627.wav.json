{"text": " just feedback you know um that's that's really how much i think that we need to be having these conversations so that at least people are okay to look at research and look at um what's causing these things think about that and try to address it here's some quotes uh from people who emailed me about me talking to you surprisingly most of the response was very positive so that speaks well of your audience yeah the point for me is this we absolutely can't normalize this kind of thing you know that i know that but there has just been a huge scandal in the uk where i'm from in which hundreds of people have come out and said that they were abused by their football coaches when they were younger that reminds me again that these things don't go away if we don't talk about them they get pushed into deeper and darker places if your conversation with this person were to encourage one person to get help instead of acting on an urge and saved one child would that be worth it if i stopped one person who has these urges from killing themselves to stop feeling the shame associated with it would that be worth it i can't answer those questions and i'm sure there are also other darker questions with opposite results that would need to be answered when considering whether or not to do this another quote was of course it's right to treat them differently for something they didn't choose to the extent that they are dangerous yikes and another one was society needs to learn how to draw a distinction between a being attracted to children and b molesting children one is involuntary the other is voluntary one is disturbing the other evil we seem to think of them as the same thing and treat them with the same scorn which cannot possibly help people who find themselves attracted to children to be able to seek help we may feel the urge to express our outrage and disgust simply at the attraction but if suppressing that urge can actually help to protect children then that's clearly what we need to do what are your thoughts i mostly agree the uh even with the person who said like we should treat people different to the extent that they're dangerous uh the the only issue i would take with i guess you know the the harsher and probably much more common stance is that i don't know that it's it's the most effective way to prevent assaults because i i think it's it's almost certainly better if people can come forward and get help than if like all they see on all sides is that is like demonization to such a degree that like they can't even admit that they have these feelings to themselves you know that's that seems like a recipe for disaster so like the only thing i would want is that we're able to have clinical style conversations about this publicly and that people feel comfortable seeking help privately so really i don't have a problem with any of those messages i'm just worried about pragmatics but i understand yeah okay um i don't think i'm in a place where i can have a completely clinical discussion about this do you um i i mean objectively i i know i can't have a completely clinical conversation about this because it affects me and it's still something that i i get emotional about uh sometimes very emotional i've had some some uh really bad nights thinking about these issues but uh so no but i would say that i try to have as clinical a conversation as i can okay um now a lot of people mention depression and and suicidal thoughts when discussing this topic uh would you say that you suffer from depression or uh yes i'm currently uh medicated for depression i don't think that it originates i'm depressed because i have these desires i i'm a lot of people in my family are depressed i think it's it's genetic but it definitely doesn't help you know it's it's something that uh depressed me can sort of use to beat myself up with so yeah that that that is a problem and they do connect even though i don't think they're you know one one doesn't come from the other you keep um talking about this as being pretty manageable for you so do you think that maybe uh in you it is uh i guess it's something that takes over less of you than it does uh other people like you have a lesser degree of this because i haven't when i spoke to the other guy he did not sound like it was it it didn't sound like it was as manageable for him as it is for you however he wanted complete normalization and he wanted it to be he's you know rationalized it and looked into it and you seem to have stayed away from it as you say you prefer to keep this part of you locked up but you do seem to be confident that it doesn't affect your day-to-day yeah yeah that's true and that's uh one way in which you know my situation might not be applicable you know like conclusions about my situation might not be applicable to other people uh you know i'm i'm non-exclusive so that takes a lot of the pressure off and uh you're right in that it's not something that is like constantly you know hanging around in the back of my head or whatever it doesn't really affect my day-to-day life that much it's just uh you know it's it can be sort of triggered situationally and then you know i just sort of like blink my eyes and and you know get on with my life but uh but yeah they're they're i'm sure there are people out there for whom uh you know i know there are people who are exclusive so that raises a whole host of other problems since they basically have to be sexually inactive for their entire life and uh also i'm sure there are people for whom it's it's a it's a much stronger compulsion and i you know those are the people who i think uh really should be encouraged to uh get psychological help yeah i mean i think that the big thing here is that you're non-exclusive so you can have meaningful sexual relationships whereas someone who is exclusively a pedophile they would never be able to act on their sexual desires it would be completely immoral for them to do so and that must be a hard thing to live with and but i yeah right yeah yeah and that's that would be much worse the the only thing i would say and uh this this will be something i'm interested to get your thoughts on uh even in that case uh the case of an exclusive pedophile with uh with very strong compulsions i would not want to institute a policy of mandating therapy purely for pragmatic reasons because i think that that will prevent people from admitting their condition right if they're going to be if they're they know they're going to be forced to be institutionalized but what what would you recommend that like so people come forth and tell the doctor or whatever that they have these really strong desires and compulsions to act on this but we can't mandate anything then what do we do um i i think it's it's perfectly fine for uh people like that and even people like me to be profiled by law enforcement like meaning that not that we're you know arrested for anything we didn't do but just that like they pay disproportionate attention to us i just think that's rational you know i i i don't know about airport security but definitely in terms of like you know what the fbi does i largely follow sam harris's line that we should use whatever statistical information we have to focus our attention and in this case that lands squarely on me so i think that's reasonable uh i think you know noticing if people stop going to their therapy is reasonable uh you know i don't know if that's internet searches and stuff watching yeah yeah sure sure but then that would get me into trouble for all sorts of things because i mean the kinds of people that i talk to i'm searching like isis and i'm searching non-offending pedophile and terrorism and i have the worst searches in the world right well i mean as long as it's just like they're like you know whoever's watching is might pay more attention i that doesn't bother me that much i don't know maybe that bothers you like there are a lot of people out there who are you know privacy absolutists or they value it for no i don't have really anything to hide so it doesn't bother me i mean if you look into my work you'll see why i'm searching these things all the time so that's pretty self-explanatory but it would scare me if they threw me in jail for searching these things definitely because i'm not a terrorist nor a pedophile so oh no absolutely and you know i i don't think they should i definitely don't want to imply that i'm saying that like anyone should be jailed preemptively for crime you weren't saying that at all but i'm just i'm just trying to just trying to think of the ways that that could be a problem however i i'm completely in favor of it as well because obviously these people that fit that profile do need to be paid a little more attention to", "segments": [{"start": 0.18, "end": 8.34, "text": " just feedback you know um that's that's really how much i think

that's really how much i think that we need to be having these conversations so that at least people are okay to look at research and look at um what's causing these things think about that and try to address it here's some quotes uh from people who emailed me about me talking to you surprisingly most of the response was very positive so that speaks well of your audience yeah the point for me is this we absolutely can't normalize this kind of thing you know that i know that but there has just been a huge scandal in the uk where i'm from in which hundreds of people have come out and said that they were abused by their football coaches when they were younger that reminds me again that these things don't go away if we don't talk about them they get pushed into deeper and darker places if your conversation with this person were to encourage one person to get help instead of acting on an urge and saved one child would that be worth it if i stopped one person who has these urges from killing themselves to stop feeling the shame associated with it would that be worth it i can't answer those questions and i'm sure there are also other darker questions with opposite results that would need to be answered when considering whether or not to do this another quote was of course it's right to treat them differently for something they didn't choose to the extent that they are dangerous yikes and another one was society needs to learn how to draw a distinction between a being attracted to children and b molesting children one is involuntary the other is voluntary one is disturbing the other evil we seem to think of them as the same thing and treat them with the same scorn which cannot possibly help people who find themselves attracted to children to be able to seek help we may feel the urge to express our outrage and disgust simply at the attraction but if suppressing that urge can actually help to protect children then that's clearly what we need to do what are your thoughts i mostly agree the uh even with the person who said like we should treat people different to the extent that they're dangerous uh the the only issue i would take with i guess you know the the harsher and probably much more common stance is that i don't know that it's it's the most effective way to prevent assaults because i i think it's it's almost certainly better if people can come forward and get help than if like all they see on all sides is that is like demonization to such a degree that like they can't even admit that they have these feelings to themselves you know that's that seems like a recipe for disaster so like the only thing i would want is that we're able to have clinical style conversations about this publicly and that people feel comfortable seeking help privately so really i don't have a problem with any of those messages i'm just worried about pragmatics but i understand yeah okay um i don't think i'm in a place where i can have a completely clinical discussion about this do you um i i mean objectively i i know i can't have a completely clinical conversation about this because it affects me and it's still something that i i get emotional about uh sometimes very emotional i've had some some uh really bad nights thinking about these issues but uh so no but i would say that i try to have as clinical a conversation as i can okay um now a lot of people mention depression and and suicidal thoughts when discussing this topic uh would you say that you suffer from depression or uh yes i'm currently uh medicated for depression i don't think that it originates i'm depressed because i have these desires i i'm a lot of people in my family are depressed i think it's it's genetic but it definitely doesn't help you know it's it's something that uh depressed me can sort of use to beat myself up with so yeah that that that is a problem and they do connect even though i don't think they're you know one one doesn't come from the other you keep um talking about this as being pretty manageable for you so do you think that maybe uh in you it is uh i guess it's something that takes over less of you than it does uh other people like you have a lesser degree of this because i haven't when i spoke to the other guy he did not sound like it was it it didn't sound like it was as manageable for him as it is for you however he wanted complete normalization and he wanted it to be he's you know rationalized it and looked into it and you seem to have stayed away from it as you say you prefer to keep this part of you locked up but you do seem to be confident that it doesn't affect your day-to-day yeah yeah that's true and that's uh one way in which you know my situation might not be applicable you know like conclusions about my situation might not be applicable to other people uh you know i'm i'm non-exclusive so that takes a lot of the pressure off and uh you're right in that it's not something that is like constantly you know hanging around in the back of my head or whatever it doesn't really affect my day-to-day life that much it's just uh you know it's it can be sort of triggered situationally and then you know i just sort of like blink my eyes and and you know get on with my life but uh but yeah they're they're i'm sure there are people out there for whom uh you know i know there are people who are exclusive so that raises a whole host of other problems since they basically have to be sexually inactive for their entire life and uh also i'm sure there are people for whom it's it's a it's a much stronger compulsion and i you know those are the people who i think uh really should be encouraged to uh get psychological help yeah i mean i think that the big thing here is that you're non-exclusive so you can have meaningful sexual relationships whereas someone who is exclusively a pedophile they would never be able to act on their sexual desires it would be completely immoral for them to do so and that must be a hard thing to live with and but i yeah right yeah yeah and that's that would be much worse the the only thing i would say and uh this this will be something i'm interested to get your thoughts on uh even in that case uh the case of an exclusive pedophile with uh with very strong compulsions i would not want to institute a policy of mandating therapy purely for pragmatic reasons because i think that that will prevent people from admitting their condition right if they're going to be if they're they know they're going to be forced to be institutionalized but what what would you recommend that like so people come forth and tell the doctor or whatever that they have these really strong desires and compulsions to act on this but we can't mandate anything then what do we do um i i think it's it's perfectly fine for uh people like that and even people like me to be profiled by law enforcement like meaning that not that we're you know arrested for anything we didn't do but just that like they pay disproportionate attention to us i just think that's rational you know i i i don't know about airport security but definitely in terms of like you know what the fbi does i largely follow sam harris's line that we should use whatever statistical information we have to focus our attention and in this case that lands squarely on me so i think that's reasonable uh i think you know noticing if people stop going to their therapy is reasonable uh you know i don't know if that's internet searches and stuff watching yeah yeah sure sure but then that would get me into trouble for all sorts of things because i mean the kinds of people that i talk to i'm searching like isis and i'm searching non-offending pedophile and terrorism and i have the worst searches in the world right well i mean as long as it's just like they're like you know whoever's watching is might pay more attention i that doesn't bother me that much i don't know maybe that bothers you like there are a lot of people out there who are you know privacy absolutists or they value it for no i don't have really anything to hide so it doesn't bother me i mean if you look into my work you'll see why i'm searching these things all the time so that's pretty self-explanatory but it would scare me if they threw me in jail for searching these things definitely because i'm not a terrorist nor a pedophile so oh no absolutely and you know i i don't think they should i definitely don't want to imply that i'm saying that like anyone should be jailed preemptively for crime you weren't saying that at all but i'm just i'm just trying to just trying to think of the ways that that could be a problem however i i'm completely in favor of it as well because obviously these people that fit that
