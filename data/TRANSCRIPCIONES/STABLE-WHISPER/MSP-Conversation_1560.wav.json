{"text": " I've got another drywall question here, which I cannot not read because this is possibly the most classic thing I've ever read. Is there any way to repair a large human-shaped hole in drywall? Don't ask. So whoever sent that in, thank you. You have made my afternoon. I've got a picture. I would like to know with the hands open. The hands are out. It's probably easier just to take off the whole panel and replace it with a new one. Okay. So, I mean, especially if it's a large human. And, you know, I'm not sure whether it's a large human-shaped hole or a large human-shaped hole. I'm simply not sure at that point. But I hope that answers your question. I would like to know if they fit it between the batons. Oh, dear. Yes, I would really love to see a picture of that. So if you're out there and you're listening, whoever sent that in, please just drop us a picture on WhatsApp and we'll tweet it. But we won't even identify you, I promise. Speaking of WhatsApp, WhatsApp advice for carpet person. The person with the worn carpet should contact the company who installed it and ask them to do an inspection. It shouldn't wear down so much in a year and the manufacturer should have a look at it. It could still be under warranty. That's from Joe in Claremont. Thank you for that, Joe, who WhatsAppped us on our WhatsApp line. The number is 072-567-1567. You can do the same if you want to. I think that's very good advice from Joe. It could still be under warranty. So you might not have to worry about it at all. Remember, these things are all, it depends how much traffic, it depends what's happening in the house. So many things could be, you know, could add to or be the reason for why it's wearing down so quickly. You know, it could be the type of carpet, the cost of the original cost of the carpet, etc. So lots of things to look at. So we've got flooring, drywalling, and now we have a question from Terry in Durbanville about a brass lamp. Hello, Terry. Hello, how are you today? Good, thank you. How are you? Hi, Terry. Yeah, yeah, it's hot, warm. It's very warm. I've got a brass lamp, which I've had for many, many years. It's a beautiful one. I bought it down from Zimbabwe. What happens to every now and then, it goes kind of greeny. So I take it in the brass, not the lamp, the brass, and I put lemon juice and warm water on it and I clean it up, but it comes back again. So I wanted to know what kind of a shellac or a paint, a clear paint that I can put on it to protect it so it doesn't keep going green on me. Or is there such a luxury? Yes, I mean, you can get, there are products that you can spray on. Remember, brass is almost non-porous to a degree. So whatever you put on there is going to require maintenance. And that's what you're going to have to be, you're substituting one for the other. Okay, so you could buy a polyurethane type spray that you could get at a hardware store, they spray it. But, you know, to me, the beauty lies in its natural finish. No, it does, yeah. When it goes green, it's not so nice. I don't know if everyone's green at the moment, but I don't want my lamp to be green. Yeah, I can imagine. You know, you're going to end up doing a bit of maintenance on both. So if you were asking me which one, I would say to me, I prefer the natural, hence the outside bath, but I prefer the natural look of the brass and cleaning it. It really is a beautiful lamp. It's a full-length thing. But still, I'll persevere with the warm water and the lemon juice. You know, you can try if we just think about it. Again, you could use a little bit of polish, like Cobra polish. But remember, you buff it up, but it's going to stay, it always stays a little bit tacky, so it could get some dirt. What about liquid silicone? You know, that they use for, I use it for cleaning my brass rails. Well, not brass, they're imitation brass rails. But I don't know about that, I might have to do to my poor lamp. No, no, I would stay away from that. Lemon juice and water, Danny. Liquid silicone, it's very sort of high-tech, hey? But yeah, never heard that one before. No, no, it's there, it's there. It's a thing. No, no, it's a thing. It's a thing, okay. But to me, that type of thing needs to be left on its own. Yes, it takes a little bit of elbow grease to clean it, but just the beauty of the product itself is... And when it shines, it's just gorgeous, isn't it? So that, I hope, Terry, that that answers your question a little bit at least. Waterproofing is not something that I would associate with somebody living in the Klang Karoo, Jane. Hi, good afternoon. It's actually, I've had a, we've just had a house constructed out of the steel frame. And the shower, they, instead of using lambda board on the shower, they've used shutter board for the shower sides. Now, how do I waterproof the shutter board? I really don't want to tile the shutter board. I'd prefer to paint it somehow. What can I use? Wow. Okay, so they've used normal shutter board. Are you sure they haven't used like a marine ply that's more waterproof? No, they've used shutter board. Wow, okay. Sorry, now I'm... It's a thing. Yeah, and I have to think. What's even the difference between lambda board and shutter board? What are these things? Well, you know, some of the boards come out waterproof. They come out to be waterproof. Yeah. So they can stand outside in the elements and they last longer than products that are not waterproof. Yeah. Now, if you're in the shower, you've got this concentrated water and it can affect and warp and damage. So you have to have it there. I'm, yeah, I need to, I'm going to need to give this some proper thought because there's joints and everything like that and you're going to need a proper, a proper spec to waterproof that. Yeah. I'm looking to find it in South Africa. Rock coat. Yeah, an Australian product. The Aussies make a lot of things. Jane, I must say congratulations to you for stumping the team this afternoon. Well done. Angelo will go away and do his homework and hopefully we'll be able to bring you some kind of an answer. She just needs to give her details and then I'll get an answer ASAP before, hopefully before I leave tomorrow. Jono will take the details and we'll hopefully be able to get back to Jane. We have a voice note to play very quickly. Hi guys, Dania from Amonis. I tried to put some wool at the back of a picture so that I could hang the picture and then stuck my two fingers together with super glue. What's the best way to get super glue off your hands? In the fridge. Okay, bye. Dan, might as well be my sister. Like, maybe we are from the same genetic wellspring because we're both from the same Because that's exactly the kind of thing I would do. How do you unglue your fingers? You can put it in the freezer for a bit. It'll go hard and then it can come off. And then it just cracks off like crackling. Okay. That's probably the easiest way. Otherwise, no. Just pull off your, like some kind of a spy, pull off the top layer of your fingerprint as well as the... Generally, put something in the fridge or in the freezer. It gets cold so you'd have to leave your hand there for a little bit. Freeze it. Maybe just stick it onto the ice sections. It gets cold, it becomes brittle and you can break it. And then you can just snap it off. Okay, Nikki in Fischhock has phoned us on 021-446-0567. And Nikki, thanks for joining us this afternoon. You want to know where to buy Rimpies? Yes, I'd like to know. We're in Cape Town. Can you buy Rimpies? Rimpies? I'm assuming you're talking about the, like the... Chairs. To put on chairs. The base of chairs. Replacing the Rimpies. Wow. Oh. Is this stump number two? I would like to... I knew it was going to happen today. This is awesome. I knew, I knew, I knew it was going to happen today. Rimpies... I'm going to find out for you. And I know someone who will know. Okay. Great. I'll phone a friend. Yes, because that's what we do. Nikki in Fischhock, who knows? Maybe somebody out there who's listening to us right now might know. Because that's what happened with Jane. So you'll remember Jane from the Klankaroo phoned us about boards. And Philip in Somerset West believes he has an answer to that. Philip, what's your solution? I don't know if it's a solution, but we... I was involved with a youth group, a scout organization, and we had to make an extra couple of shards when we got more girls. And all we did was use shutterboard with Velviglow. And that was 14 years ago, and it's still absolutely fine. Velviglow. Okay. Interesting. Normal, normal, normal Plascon, or I think it's Plascon Velviglow. It's a Plascon Velviglow paint, and it has got an automatic... I think it's a non-fungal paint, so it doesn't mold. And it actually works very well. We paint it once every four or five years just to make it look better, but it works perfectly. Yeah, I think the very... I mean, the Plascon Velviglow is a great product. And, you know, it's good for bathrooms. Because it's an enamel-based product, so it's not... It doesn't... The fungal... The moss and the fungus can't grow on it as well. That's the first thing. It works perfectly. And you can get the Rimpis from any leather importer. They sell them. Oh, there you go. Thank you, Philip. So Philip answers both the questions. I do think the question needs to be asked, though, is how often do they use that shower? Because, you know, if it's being used once in a blue moon, that's separate to someone showering every day. And there could be a difference there. So I just want to get my facts 100% sure and correct before I say something, and then I get... You're taking to task next time around. Because we simply never know. One last question before we let you go this afternoon. Also about flooring. Is it possible to put laminated floor on top of a laminated floor? I don't see why not. You have to look at the... You'd have to look at the gap you have between your doors. Of course, there's skirtings. And if your underlying floor is not level, then your top floor won't be level. To do that shouldn't be a problem at all. Okay. So, easy answer. I'm sorry. Thank goodness. Listener stumped you twice today, Angelo. Thank you so much for joining us as always. I don't know whether we're going to see you back in the first week of the new year, are we? I think it's the fifth. The fifth. Okay. So we will see you back. I'm in for Pippa then as well. So we can do this all over again. Have a wonderful Christmas. Awesome. Look forward to it. And enjoy your restoration.

classic thing I've ever read. Is there any way to repair a large human-shaped hole in drywall? Don't ask. So whoever sent that in, thank you. You have made my afternoon. I've got a picture. I would like to know with the hands open. The hands are out. It's probably easier just to take off the whole panel and replace it with a new one. Okay. So, I mean, especially if it's a large human. And, you know, I'm not sure whether it's a large human-shaped hole or a large human-shaped hole. I'm simply not sure at that point. But I hope that answers your question. I would like to know if they fit it between the batons. Oh, dear. Yes, I would really love to see a picture of that. So if you're out there and you're listening, whoever sent that in, please just drop us a picture on WhatsApp and we'll tweet it. But we won't even identify you, I promise. Speaking of WhatsApp, WhatsApp advice for carpet person. The person with the worn carpet should contact the company who installed it and ask them to do an inspection. It shouldn't wear down so much in a year and the manufacturer should have a look at it. It could still be under warranty. That's from Joe in Claremont. Thank you for that, Joe, who WhatsAppped us on our WhatsApp line. The number is 072-567-1567. You can do the same if you want to. I think that's very good advice from Joe. It could still be under warranty. So you might not have to worry about it at all. Remember, these things are all, it depends how much traffic, it depends what's happening in the house. So many things could be, you know, could add to or be the reason for why it's wearing down so quickly. You know, it could be the type of carpet, the cost of the original cost of the carpet, etc. So lots of things to look at. So we've got flooring, drywalling, and now we have a question from Terry in Durbanville about a brass lamp. Hello, Terry. Hello, how are you today? Good, thank you. How are you? Hi, Terry. Yeah, yeah, it's hot, warm. It's very warm. I've got a brass lamp, which I've had for many, many years. It's a beautiful one. I bought it down from Zimbabwe. What happens to every now and then, it goes kind of greeny. So I take it in the brass, not the lamp, the brass, and I put lemon juice and warm water on it and I clean it up, but it comes back again. So I wanted to know what kind of a shellac or a paint, a clear paint that I can put on it to protect it so it doesn't keep going green on me. Or is there such a luxury? Yes, I mean, you can get, there are products that you can spray on. Remember, brass is almost non-porous to a degree. So whatever you put on there is going to require maintenance. And that's what you're going to have to be, you're substituting one for the other. Okay, so you could buy a polyurethane type spray that you could get at a hardware store, they spray it. But, you know, to me, the beauty lies in its natural finish. No, it does, yeah. When it goes green, it's not so nice. I don't know if everyone's green at the moment, but I don't want my lamp to be green. Yeah, I can imagine. You know, you're going to end up doing a bit of maintenance on both. So if you were asking me which one, I would say to me, I prefer the natural, hence the outside bath, but I prefer the natural look of the brass and cleaning it. It really is a beautiful lamp. It's a full-length thing. But still, I'll persevere with the warm water and the lemon juice. You know, you can try if we just think about it. Again, you could use a little bit of polish, like Cobra polish. But remember, you buff it up, but it's going to stay, it always stays a little bit tacky, so it could get some dirt. What about liquid silicone? You know, that they use for, I use it for cleaning my brass rails. Well, not brass, they're imitation brass rails. But I don't know about that, I might have to do to my poor lamp. No, no, I would stay away from that. Lemon juice and water, Danny. Liquid silicone, it's very sort of high-tech, hey? But yeah, never heard that one before. No, no, it's there, it's there. It's a thing. No, no, it's a thing. It's a thing, okay. But to me, that type of thing needs to be left on its own. Yes, it takes a little bit of elbow grease to clean it, but just the beauty of the product itself is... And when it shines, it's just gorgeous, isn't it? So that, I hope, Terry, that that answers your question a little bit at least. Waterproofing is not something that I would associate with somebody living in the Klang Karoo, Jane. Hi, good afternoon. It's actually, I've had a, we've just had a house constructed out of the steel frame. And the shower, they, instead of using lambda board on the shower, they've used shutter board for the shower sides. Now, how do I waterproof the shutter board? I really don't want to tile the shutter board. I'd prefer to paint it somehow. What can I use? Wow. Okay, so they've used normal shutter board. Are you sure they haven't used like a marine ply that's more waterproof? No, they've used shutter board. Wow, okay. Sorry, now I'm... It's a thing. Yeah, and I have to think. What's even the difference between lambda board and shutter board? What are these things? Well, you know, some of the boards come out waterproof. They come out to be waterproof. Yeah. So they can stand outside in the elements and they last longer than products that are not waterproof. Yeah. Now, if you're in the shower, you've got this concentrated water and it can affect and warp and damage. So you have to have it there. I'm, yeah, I need to, I'm going to need to give this some proper thought because there's joints and everything like that and you're going to need a proper, a proper spec to waterproof that. Yeah. I'm looking to find it in South Africa. Rock coat. Yeah, an Australian product. The Aussies make a lot of things. Jane, I must say congratulations to you for stumping the team this afternoon. Well done. Angelo will go away and do his homework and hopefully we'll be able to bring you some kind of an answer. She just needs to give her details and then I'll get an answer ASAP before, hopefully before I leave tomorrow. Jono will take the details and we'll hopefully be able to get back to Jane. We have a voice note to play very quickly. Hi guys, Dania from Amonis. I tried to put some wool at the back of a picture so that I could hang the picture and then stuck my two fingers together with super glue. What's the best way to get super glue off your hands? In the fridge. Okay, bye. Dan, might as well be my sister. Like, maybe we are from the same genetic wellspring because we're both from the same Because that's exactly the kind of thing I would do. How do you unglue your fingers? You can put it in the freezer for a bit. It'll go hard and then it can come off. And then it just cracks off like crackling. Okay. That's probably the easiest way. Otherwise, no. Just pull off your, like some kind of a spy, pull off the top layer of your fingerprint as well as the... Generally, put something in the fridge or in the freezer. It gets cold so you'd have to leave your hand there for a little bit. Freeze it. Maybe just stick it onto the ice sections. It gets cold, it becomes brittle and you can break it. And then you can just snap it off. Okay, Nikki in Fischhock has phoned us on 021-446-0567. And Nikki, thanks for joining us this afternoon. You want to know where to buy Rimpies? Yes, I'd like to know. We're in Cape Town. Can you buy Rimpies? Rimpies? I'm assuming you're talking about the, like the... Chairs. To put on chairs. The base of chairs. Replacing the Rimpies. Wow. Oh. Is this stump number two? I would like to... I knew it was going to happen today. This is awesome. I knew, I knew, I knew it was going to happen today. Rimpies... I'm going to find out for you. And I know someone who will know. Okay. Great. I'll phone a friend. Yes, because that's what we do. Nikki in Fischhock, who knows? Maybe somebody out there who's listening to us right now might know. Because that's what happened with Jane. So you'll remember Jane from the Klankaroo phoned us about boards. And Philip in Somerset West believes he has an answer to that. Philip, what's your solution? I don't know if it's a solution, but we... I was involved with a youth group, a scout organization, and we had to make an extra couple of shards when we got more girls. And all we did was use shutterboard with Velviglow. And that was 14 years ago, and it's still absolutely fine. Velviglow. Okay. Interesting. Normal, normal, normal Plascon, or I think it's Plascon Velviglow. It's a Plascon Velviglow paint, and it has got an automatic... I think it's a non-fungal paint, so it doesn't mold. And it actually works very well. We paint it once every four or five years just to make it look better, but it works perfectly. Yeah, I think the very... I mean, the Plascon Velviglow is a great product. And, you know, it's good for bathrooms. Because it's an enamel-based product, so it's not... It doesn't... The fungal... The moss and the fungus can't grow on it as well. That's the first thing. It works perfectly. And you can get the Rimpis from any leather importer. They sell them. Oh, there you go. Thank you, Philip. So Philip answers both the questions. I do think the question needs to be asked, though, is how often do they use that shower? Because, you know, if it's being used once in a blue moon, that's separate to someone showering every day. And there could be a difference there. So I just want to get my facts 100% sure and correct before I say something, and then I get... You're taking to task next time around. Because we simply never know. One last question before we let you go this afternoon. Also about flooring. Is it possible to put laminated floor on top of a laminated floor? I don't see why not. You have to look at the... You'd have to look at the gap you have between your doors. Of course, there's skirtings. And if your underlying floor is not level, then your top floor won't be level. To do that shouldn't be a problem at all. Okay. So, easy answer. I'm sorry. Thank goodness. Listener stumped you twice today, Angelo. Thank you so much for joining us as always. I don't know whether we're going to see you back in the first week of the new year, are we? I think it's the fifth. The fifth. Okay. So we will see you back. I'm in for Pippa then as well. So we can do this all over again. Have a wonderful Christmas. Awesome. Look forward to it. And enjoy your restoration.

So I take it in the brass, not the lamp, the brass, and I put lemon juice and warm water on it and I clean it up, but it comes back again. So I wanted to know what kind of a shellac or a paint, a clear paint that I can put on it to protect it so it doesn't keep going green on me.
