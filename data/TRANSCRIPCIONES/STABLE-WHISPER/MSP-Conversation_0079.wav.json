{"text": " The results here being that Japanese normally don't know or, well, don't want to or some, I don't know, Cthulhu doesn't allow them to finish their things right. Makes sense. I mean, I listened. Here's the thing. I mean, I heard something about how the ending of a memory is what you actually remember from that memory. The feeling you have at the end of it becomes the thing. If you had a terrible time, but at the end of it you got blown. So you're saying that memory functions on emotion? Yeah. Okay. That's what I mean. I mean, American way of telling stories is good because at the end, no matter if it is Pacific Rim, if it had had a good ending, I wouldn't hate it so much. Yeah, exactly. Because at the end, it left me with this good feeling. And then the good feeling extends to the entirety of the work. And that's what I think makes some people go away from anime because that's rarely the case. Yeah. And at most, what you're going to get from anime is not a feel-good thing. It's going to be a what the fuck are you doing with your life thing. Yeah. So, yeah. But that's the thing. I mean, they don't really get it across. Yeah. Sometimes it really just doesn't make any sense. Sometimes it's pointless. Many times it's pointless. And, well, for example, also another thing that I don't like in Japanese storytelling is the inconsistency when it comes to the storytelling. I mean, Mexicans might be consistent in production, but Japanese are really inconsistent when it comes to the structure or the facts of their stories. You mean, for example, I mean, there's other things that I don't know if you want to get to this, but there are stories in Japanese in anime that they start being one thing, then it seems like at the middle of the thing they decided they don't want to tell that story anymore? Yeah. But that's a very Asian thing. It's in Korean works, I mean, according to what I heard from Ryan Strada, that I think consumes... Link in the show notes. It seems that Koreans do that a lot too. And he emulated that in one of his works. I mean, and he made it a point to mention it, so that's why I mention it here. But I mean inconsistency in their facts, like, for example, and this is what made me not like Pacific Rim so much, that Guillermo del Toro, or Guillermo del Toro, who's a Mexican, tried to emulate Japanese storytelling so much in it that there were inconsistencies. For example, at the beginning, well, no, after this guy, I don't remember their, I don't even remember their names. I know, right? Like, whoa. But after this guy goes back to piloting a Jaeger, and he's piloting it with the girl, and they're trying to beat the shit out of the kaiju, right? Yeah. And, okay, so it seems that the only way they have to fight with it is beating the shit out of the kaiju. And they beat the shit out of it with their fists. Which makes perfect sense, right? I mean... Yeah, and then, it's like, hey, he took half of our body off. Okay, then take the sword out. What? You had a sword? Why didn't you use it from the goddamn beginning? Because it would be awesome. Fuck you. I know. And then, I remember this scene very clearly because this guy takes this, um, storage hanger things from the dock. I mean, those big, big, big metal containers. Yeah. And he grabs them, and he beats the shit out of this, the kaiju with it. I mean, okay, your fists are made of some goddamn metal that does not get bent when hitting a kaiju. Do you really think that a goddamn metal container that was crushed when you grabbed it is gonna help you do more damage? It does work. I mean... It doesn't make sense. I know. And that's the kind of things that Japanese, uh, do a lot with their works. There's a lot of inconsistencies in the facts of the story. Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true. And, uh, I got a really, a really good kick out of something told, something someone told me. Uh, okay, I understand that at the very beginning of the movie, when the, uh, protagonist's brother dies, uh, they didn't use a sword, maybe because they didn't have a sword back then. Yeah. Right? Okay. Here's the thing. Uh, someone told me that they read up on the backstory quotes, a lot of quotes here, uh, for the movie. And he's saying that, uh, he, well, he read that the swords, uh, eat up a lot of the energy from the, from the Jaeger. Okay. And I'm like, dude, did you see that? Did you see how many plasma gun blasts they waste before getting the fucking sword out? You're gonna tell me a plasma gun does, eats less energy away than a sword. Really. Isn't a sword really a stick? A hardened stick? Yeah. I mean, what the fuck? It didn't really make sense what he said. I mean, I didn't want to, uh, argue with this guy, but, it's that, those kinds of things that really, really get me angry when watching something, uh, some, uh, piece of Japanese word, storytelling. About, um, Also, I don't know how the communications kept working when they crossed the gate to the other dimension. Because, obviously, they, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. So, if you have this communication system, even if you go through this dimensional barrier, you get to, uh, No. You know, I mean, No. No. Man, I mean, you're so behind on this shit. What the fuck? No, but, you know what I hate about this thing? That, I see so many guys, so many Americans, go to Pacific Rim to exemplify a movie in which it is not an American that saves the day. I mean it. Oh, come on. I mean it. There are many, many, many people who I've seen say this. This is not the typical thing where the American get to save the world. What the hell? The fucking guy was American. What the fuck? There were, I mean, not only was he American, it was the Australian guys who were going to save the day. But, fuck you, because we're American and we rock, motherfucker. Yeah. What the hell? Yeah. You had a Japanese girl in the fucking robot, but you couldn't let her be the one who saved the fucking day. Exactly. Because that would make the communist win or something. What the fuck? Wasn't she Shizu? No, she was Japanese. No, she was Japanese. Yeah. Yeah. They were in Shanghai. That's why she said, that's Japanese. Yeah. But, I mean, really, I didn't know that people were saying that. That's stupid. I do mean, yeah. That's fucking stupid. Really, I mean, what the fuck? You know, an American got to save the day, but really, in the end, aren't we all American on this? Isn't America what we're all supposed to be? Worldwide. Worldwide. Worldwide entity. Really? What the fuck? That's just so hilarious to read. Like, whoa. Whoa. But here's the thing, Anat. Before you go on, I mean, Guillermo del Toro, Guillermo del Toro, is a Mexican. Yeah. And yet, we get an American saving the day yet again. Yep. Where was the Mexican Jager? I know. What would be the name of it, anyway? I mean... They never finish it. No, I... But I'm pretty sure they would pick a cheesy name for it. It would be something like El Santos. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Or La Troca. La Troca. Yeah. The truck, by the way, in Spanish. But, yeah, and that's the point. For example, and that's what I like a lot about the independent community, Blender, for example, with their short movie, Sintel. Yeah. I loved the ending. Yeah, it was good. I loved the ending. It's not a typical American ending, and yet, it left me with a satisfying feeling. It was sad. Yes, it was sad, but it was a good ending. It... And if you guys haven't... You had closure from it. If you guys haven't seen this, Sintel movie, it is really good. It is an open movie made by the Blender Foundation, who make Blender 3D. I would assume that you guys, being visual artists, should know about it, but if you don't, go watch it. It's going to be in the description. I'll link to it. It's really awesome. It's awesome. And the guy who directed this, his name is Colin Levi, or something like that. He is American, and he did say that he didn't want to have a typical American ending. Nice. But, at the same time, he didn't want to go to the sad ending, either. So, it's really, really, really funny, because in the comments for this picture, you're going to see many American guys and many American girls go with this sentiment that the ending sucked, because it wasn't a happy ending, per se. But, I mean, it wasn't a sad ending, either. It's this weird mix between the European sad ending and the American happy ending that's just so satisfying to me. Yeah. I loved it. I really, really loved it. I cried. I cried. And my girlfriend also cried. And she doesn't even speak English. Did she cry? Yeah, yeah. She did cry. Wow. She does have a heart, sometimes. Especially when it comes to little, cute animals. Wow. I didn't know that he was American. That's awesome. That's awesome. Wow. My hat goes off to him. Really good work. He works at Pixar now. He's in the... That makes sense. Yeah. He's in the, I think, in the... blocking department, where they choose the shots that they're going to use. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He does deserve it. I mean, he's awesome. Like an animatic, right? Yeah. Exactly. Well, that's awesome. And, wow, good for Pixar for getting that kind of talent into their ranks. That's why they don't talk. Yeah. I mean, they will. Yeah. Except for Cars 2. Well, I guess that pretty much covers the subject, right? The thing is, with this podcast, we've covered, like, a gazillion fucking topics, so... Yeah. Yeah, the title of the thing is going to change, but I hope you guys liked our rambling, should we call this thing? Yeah. Mambo jumbo. We loved having you listen to it, if you actually did. If you hated us, please let us know. Me too. You can leave a comment telling us to go fuck ourselves, or whatever you want. We're going to actually do it. I mean, I guarantee you, but if you tell us to the... No, no. I don't just go home with it. I mean, wow. I will record it. Okay, I might do it, but you will never see it unless you call 1-800... So, yeah. I hope you guys liked it. We had fun recording this weird, whatever, fuck it was. Dusty Highway here, just listening and being a bitch. So, yeah. We're going to be trying to do this weekly, with a little more structure to it, or less structure, or more racism. Also, it would help, I don't know, at least it would help me, if you left us comments on how long you want these things to be house-structured, or if you just like this rambling, we'll just keep doing this. So... Yeah. Just to give you guys what you want. Yeah. If there are any of you out there. So, yeah. If you want to know a little more about us, you can find my co-host's works at... What's the URL?

Japanese normally don't know or, well, don't want to or some, I don't know, Cthulhu doesn't allow them to finish their things right. Makes sense. I mean, I listened. Here's the thing. I mean, I heard something about how the ending of a memory is what you actually remember from that memory. The feeling you have at the end of it becomes the thing. If you had a terrible time, but at the end of it you got blown. So you're saying that memory functions on emotion? Yeah. Okay. That's what I mean. I mean, American way of telling stories is good because at the end, no matter if it is Pacific Rim, if it had had a good ending, I wouldn't hate it so much. Yeah, exactly. Because at the end, it left me with this good feeling. And then the good feeling extends to the entirety of the work. And that's what I think makes some people go away from anime because that's rarely the case. Yeah. And at most, what you're going to get from anime is not a feel-good thing. It's going to be a what the fuck are you doing with your life thing. Yeah. So, yeah. But that's the thing. I mean, they don't really get it across. Yeah. Sometimes it really just doesn't make any sense. Sometimes it's pointless. Many times it's pointless. And, well, for example, also another thing that I don't like in Japanese storytelling is the inconsistency when it comes to the storytelling. I mean, Mexicans might be consistent in production, but Japanese are really inconsistent when it comes to the structure or the facts of their stories. You mean, for example, I mean, there's other things that I don't know if you want to get to this, but there are stories in Japanese in anime that they start being one thing, then it seems like at the middle of the thing they decided they don't want to tell that story anymore? Yeah. But that's a very Asian thing. It's in Korean works, I mean, according to what I heard from Ryan Strada, that I think consumes... Link in the show notes. It seems that Koreans do that a lot too. And he emulated that in one of his works. I mean, and he made it a point to mention it, so that's why I mention it here. But I mean inconsistency in their facts, like, for example, and this is what made me not like Pacific Rim so much, that Guillermo del Toro, or Guillermo del Toro, who's a Mexican, tried to emulate Japanese storytelling so much in it that there were inconsistencies. For example, at the beginning, well, no, after this guy, I don't remember their, I don't even remember their names. I know, right? Like, whoa. But after this guy goes back to piloting a Jaeger, and he's piloting it with the girl, and they're trying to beat the shit out of the kaiju, right? Yeah. And, okay, so it seems that the only way they have to fight with it is beating the shit out of the kaiju. And they beat the shit out of it with their fists. Which makes perfect sense, right? I mean... Yeah, and then, it's like, hey, he took half of our body off. Okay, then take the sword out. What? You had a sword? Why didn't you use it from the goddamn beginning? Because it would be awesome. Fuck you. I know. And then, I remember this scene very clearly because this guy takes this, um, storage hanger things from the dock. I mean, those big, big, big metal containers. Yeah. And he grabs them, and he beats the shit out of this, the kaiju with it. I mean, okay, your fists are made of some goddamn metal that does not get bent when hitting a kaiju. Do you really think that a goddamn metal container that was crushed when you grabbed it is gonna help you do more damage? It does work. I mean... It doesn't make sense. I know. And that's the kind of things that Japanese, uh, do a lot with their works. There's a lot of inconsistencies in the facts of the story. Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true. And, uh, I got a really, a really good kick out of something told, something someone told me. Uh, okay, I understand that at the very beginning of the movie, when the, uh, protagonist's brother dies, uh, they didn't use a sword, maybe because they didn't have a sword back then. Yeah. Right? Okay. Here's the thing. Uh, someone told me that they read up on the backstory quotes, a lot of quotes here, uh, for the movie. And he's saying that, uh, he, well, he read that the swords, uh, eat up a lot of the energy from the, from the Jaeger. Okay. And I'm like, dude, did you see that? Did you see how many plasma gun blasts they waste before getting the fucking sword out? You're gonna tell me a plasma gun does, eats less energy away than a sword. Really. Isn't a sword really a stick? A hardened stick? Yeah. I mean, what the fuck? It didn't really make sense what he said. I mean, I didn't want to, uh, argue with this guy, but, it's that, those kinds of things that really, really get me angry when watching something, uh, some, uh, piece of Japanese word, storytelling. About, um, Also, I don't know how the communications kept working when they crossed the gate to the other dimension. Because, obviously, they, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. So, if you have this communication system, even if you go through this dimensional barrier, you get to, uh, No. You know, I mean, No. No. Man, I mean, you're so behind on this shit. What the fuck? No, but, you know what I hate about this thing? That, I see so many guys, so many Americans, go to Pacific Rim to exemplify a movie in which it is not an American that saves the day. I mean it. Oh, come on. I mean it. There are many, many, many people who I've seen say this. This is not the typical thing where the American get to save the world. What the hell? The fucking guy was American. What the fuck? There were, I mean, not only was he American, it was the Australian guys who were going to save the day. But, fuck you, because we're American and we rock, motherfucker. Yeah. What the hell? Yeah. You had a Japanese girl in the fucking robot, but you couldn't let her be the one who saved the fucking day. Exactly. Because that would make the communist win or something. What the fuck? Wasn't she Shizu? No, she was Japanese. No, she was Japanese. Yeah. Yeah. They were in Shanghai. That's why she said, that's Japanese. Yeah. But, I mean, really, I didn't know that people were saying that. That's stupid. I do mean, yeah. That's fucking stupid. Really, I mean, what the fuck? You know, an American got to save the day, but really, in the end, aren't we all American on this? Isn't America what we're all supposed to be? Worldwide. Worldwide. Worldwide entity. Really? What the fuck? That's just so hilarious to read. Like, whoa. Whoa. But here's the thing, Anat. Before you go on, I mean, Guillermo del Toro, Guillermo del Toro, is a Mexican. Yeah. And yet, we get an American saving the day yet again. Yep. Where was the Mexican Jager? I know. What would be the name of it, anyway? I mean... They never finish it. No, I... But I'm pretty sure they would pick a cheesy name for it. It would be something like El Santos. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Or La Troca. La Troca. Yeah. The truck, by the way, in Spanish. But, yeah, and that's the point. For example, and that's what I like a lot about the independent community, Blender, for example, with their short movie, Sintel. Yeah. I loved the ending. Yeah, it was good. I loved the ending. It's not a typical American ending, and yet, it left me with a satisfying feeling. It was sad. Yes, it was sad, but it was a good ending. It... And if you guys haven't... You had closure from it. If you guys haven't seen this, Sintel movie, it is really good. It is an open movie made by the Blender Foundation, who make Blender 3D. I would assume that you guys, being visual artists, should know about it, but if you don't, go watch it. It's going to be in the description. I'll link to it. It's really awesome. It's awesome. And the guy who directed this, his name is Colin Levi, or something like that. He is American, and he did say that he didn't want to have a typical American ending. Nice. But, at the same time, he didn't want to go to the sad ending, either. So, it's really, really, really funny, because in the comments for this picture, you're going to see many American guys and many American girls go with this sentiment that the ending sucked, because it wasn't a happy ending, per se. But, I mean, it wasn't a sad ending, either. It's this weird mix between the European sad ending and the American happy ending that's just so satisfying to me. Yeah. I loved it. I really, really loved it. I cried. I cried. And my girlfriend also cried. And she doesn't even speak English. Did she cry? Yeah, yeah. She did cry. Wow. She does have a heart, sometimes. Especially when it comes to little, cute animals. Wow. I didn't know that he was American. That's awesome. That's awesome. Wow. My hat goes off to him. Really good work. He works at Pixar now. He's in the... That makes sense. Yeah. He's in the, I think, in the... blocking department, where they choose the shots that they're going to use. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He does deserve it. I mean, he's awesome. Like an animatic, right? Yeah. Exactly. Well, that's awesome. And, wow, good for Pixar for getting that kind of talent into their ranks. That's why they don't talk. Yeah. I mean, they will. Yeah. Except for Cars 2. Well, I guess that pretty much covers the subject, right? The thing is, with this podcast, we've covered, like, a gazillion fucking topics, so... Yeah. Yeah, the title of the thing is going to change, but I hope you guys liked our rambling, should we call this thing? Yeah. Mambo jumbo. We loved having you listen to it, if you actually did. If you hated us, please let us know. Me too. You can leave a comment telling us to go fuck ourselves, or whatever you want. We're going to actually do it. I mean, I guarantee you, but if you tell us to the... No, no. I don't just go home with it. I mean, wow. I will record it. Okay, I might do it, but you will never see it unless you call 1-800... So, yeah. I hope you guys liked it. We had fun recording this weird, whatever, fuck it was. Dusty Highway here, just listening and being a bitch. So, yeah. We're going to be trying to do this weekly, with a little more structure to it, or less structure, or more racism. Also, it would help, I don't know, at least it would help me, if you left us comments on how long you want these things to be house-structured, or if you just like this rambling, we'll just keep doing this. So... Yeah. Just to give you guys what you want. Yeah. If there are any of you out there. So, yeah. If you want to know a little more about us, you can find my co-host's works at... What's the URL?
