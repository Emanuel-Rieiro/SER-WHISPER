{"text": " In the health center delivery rooms, we were starting to also see some impacts. And the drastic reduction in rainfall was starting to impact on health services. As patients were, you know, there was no, most of the health services at the moment don't have access to clean water throughout the year. So this is something, and water and sanitation issues is a big issue in all the health centers and also schools. So it's certainly something that where people had access, health centers could continue to work. But in many cases, people don't have access to that. So health centers also had to reduce their regular work and so on. And women needing to deliver at health centers had to bring their liters and liters of their own water to be able to help in the post delivery stage and so on. So Margaret's son in Middle Fly, Mogulu, you know, early this year, the signs of prolonged food insecurity were, you know, definitely very clearly evident. Increasingly indications of severe and acute malnutrition in many parts of the country, but particularly in Western province, which is one of the more remote areas of Papua New Guinea. There were scenes, you know, normally you won't see these kind of scenes. And actually when we managed to get one of the people, Sally Lloyd, who's working there and is part of the network of people, missionaries who are based at community level, when she came down to Moresby and showed some of the pictures, I think many people, including in Port Moresby, were quite shocked at the level of distress for families. From the first reports of the drought in the middle of 2015, the government actually had begun to start to respond together with partners. There were a series of assessment missions that were sent out. Government together with development partners going to four different locations, trying to assess where were the really severe needs, where were people able to cope and so on. The government allocated 203 million kina, which is roughly 70 million US dollars for the response. And this certainly isn't a small contribution. This is actually quite a significant contribution in Papua New Guinea. But as I think most of you will know, Papua New Guinea is an extremely high cost location. To travel to get supplies from Port Moresby up to some of the remote areas is extremely costly. The way that the government approached this was to allocate a large amount of that funding through the MPs. And I think many MPs, of course, did respond in their own constituencies and so on. And that has both positives and negatives. On the one hand, it definitely enables the local member to try and build the relationships with the constituencies. But there are obvious issues there as well about which people are local members most likely to support. Are they likely to get out into the most remote areas and so on? There are a whole series of issues that I think in the lesson learning workshops that are now being planned are starting to be talked about much more. And humanitarian partners, including the churches, the non-governmental organizations, PNG Red Cross, the bilaterals, including Australia, New Zealand, European Union as well, and the UN system started also supporting a lot of the humanitarian activities. Both in terms of assessment, but also in terms of starting the response in sectors like water and sanitation, agricultural recovery, health and education and so on. Now, in January, February of 2016, we did, there was a much more comprehensive countrywide assessment, which was done by the World Food Programme. And which they used a telephone survey methodology, as well as using the contacts from all of the development partners. And here I'd like to pay particular tribute to colleagues from the church partnership, but also Mike Burke, who is one of the leading agronomists working from Australia, working very closely with a range of church partners, including Matthew Kanua, ex-secretary of the Agriculture and Livestock Department here. Together, using all of our networks, a near sort of countrywide assessment was done in January, February. And there we found that 1.4 million people were in what we would regard as, you know, pretty severe food insecure. 162,000, 1.4 billion, sorry, in food insecure, and then 162,000 to up to about 200,000 people in what we would regard as extremely food insecure, where perhaps they're having to manage on perhaps just one meal a day or even skip the one meal a day. So this assessment, coupled with additional reports from partners, all pointed towards the need for a much more concerted longer term support, which would be required. And one of the things that that assessment also did was to look at some of the priority sectors. The disaster management team and the joint interagency coordination mechanism for humanitarian response in Papua New Guinea, right, really had been working from the previous year. But from April to September this year, there's been a lot more concerted effort. There was a, what we regarded as a surf appeal, which is an emergency appeal also, where in the first instance, looking at all of these priority sectors, we estimated that approximately to do this really effectively, up to $37 million would be required to be able to respond to this and to ensure that people were fed, were able to respond to this. And so we were able to look after themselves right up to the time where at least they could harvest, a full harvest, and be ready to plant for the next growing season. And the plan was to respond at least to the people with extreme food insecurity, the 162,000 or round about that figure in terms of World Food Programme's food security survey. We focus very much on what we regard as life saving food support and nutrition support. So those were the two key categories. But in addition, there was a range of work being done in the health sector, supporting health facilities in the wash, water and sanitation to try and improve clean water and hygiene practices and support for people, but also in agricultural recovery, thinking about seeds and tools that communities would need, and also thinking about early recovery work. Of the 37 million appeal, we received 39% of funding. To date, this work has now led to food response for that 162,000 food and nutrition support. And we're focusing very much in the high altitude areas, as well as in Milne Bay, the outer islands of Milne Bay, where there was also acute requirement for support. Other sectors have been left to a range of more traditional mechanisms, the church partnership, the bilaterals, also some of the foundations to support. One of the things to mention here is that unfortunately to date, we haven't been able to get a lot of the early recovery work, which is to try and tide communities over, not just to deal with the current crisis, but to help them for the longer term and to support their resilience efforts. But there's a range of needs still out there, but we're working with the funds that we receive. So in the food distribution points, and here we work very closely with the non-governmental organizations and particularly Care International, who were the implementing partner up in the highlands for this work. And I was fortunate to go up there about five weeks ago, six weeks ago, to see some of the food distribution taking place. The food distribution is primarily focused on support with rice, support for each family with very close work with the provincial authorities and with the National Disaster Management Center, working with local leaders as well, trying to ensure that every family has in those areas up to eight weeks of support. Which could at least tide them to the point where they could harvest the first set of their own, from their own gardens, a set of foods. And in this, we were particularly looking at the most vulnerable segments of the population, female headed households, the elderly, persons with disability, also thinking about very hard about how to ensure that it wasn't just men who controlled this food, but also women and children who had access to this food. So in addition to the blanket distribution, one of the issues that has surfaced, there is also issues around how to deal with conflict. Because inevitably, in a lot of these areas, particularly in remote areas, if you're not careful, it can lead to higher levels of conflict. And that's something that we've needed to navigate very closely. So we are supporting, the UN is supporting provincial government distribution of emergency food supplies in remote areas in Mogollu, as well as in Western District, as well as Anga and Hala. And in, as I said, the outer islands of Milne Bay. And it is an extremely costly operation because the logistics of these areas mean that you actually have to fly a lot of these supplies up to these remote areas. We're particularly thankful for one of the hallmarks of this, the way we have managed this, is really good partnership, not just between government and development partners and non-governmental organizations, but also with some of the businesses and particularly the foundations, the Oktadi Foundation, the Digicel Foundation that I'd like to mention, but also the Rotary Club, who have played an important role, as well as the sort of more traditional humanitarian partners, bilaterals, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, the USAID, and others working with the UN system and with the churches and so on. Rice distributions are taking place in remote coastal locations, as I mentioned, also in Milne Bay. And people living on the really remote, tactile areas. And one of the things we were able to do just a couple of months ago was also to take Ambassador Macharia, who is the Kenyan permanent representative to the United Nations, and the Secretary General's one of two climate envoys. He came to the Pacific and we were able to take him to Kiribina, out in the Trobriands, where he saw some of the really difficult struggles that islanders in these remote areas were really struggling with getting sort of access to clean water and so on. And it was really great to be able to take him there and actually see the impact of climate change in the longer run. Okay, so the UN clearly recognizes Papua New Guinea as a severely affected country by the El Nino globally. We have, you know, as I said, we've been fortunate in being able to also help to shine a bit more spotlight and highlight the impact on smaller communities and, you know, people living in remoter areas and on atolls and so on. And part of all of this also is helping us to now rethink with the national government about disaster planning for the medium and longer term. And there are a set of lessons that we're starting to learn and sharing across the development partners on some of this. And of course, you know, at a time when this is the first year of the Sustainable Development Goals, this is really important trying to get communities also really more aware of the Sustainable Development Goals and their own role in support in working with governments, but also with others in supporting better action towards the achievement of the SDGs. PNG response this time around, 17, more than 17 active humanitarian partners, including a lot of the donors, six priority sectors being supported. As I said, one of the new things this time around compared to 97 was the new partnerships, particularly involving private sector working with government, non-governmental organisations and the official aid agencies and so on. So far, we have supported up to 144,000 people during this particular, particularly in the last sort of this year, part of this year, the last five months. But actually, over the course of this, more than that number of people have been supported. A little bit about, you know, the need to continue this work, because clearly one of the big lessons of humanitarian action is that it doesn't end when the rains start. These things have longer term implications because they impact on people's health, their ability to support future development interventions in their own communities and so on. But there's definitely a lot of lessons to be learned from all of us about how we could improve further next time around. But overall, I feel that we have done a pretty good job in building the right partnerships and helping communities to respond. Let me stop there. I've tried to cover quite quickly some of the things, but happy to take questions or any comments.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 2.72, "text": " In the health center delivery rooms,", "seek":

impacts. And the drastic reduction in rainfall was starting to impact on health services. As patients were, you know, there was no, most of the health services at the moment don't have access to clean water throughout the year. So this is something, and water and sanitation issues is a big issue in all the health centers and also schools. So it's certainly something that where people had access, health centers could continue to work. But in many cases, people don't have access to that. So health centers also had to reduce their regular work and so on. And women needing to deliver at health centers had to bring their liters and liters of their own water to be able to help in the post delivery stage and so on. So Margaret's son in Middle Fly, Mogulu, you know, early this year, the signs of prolonged food insecurity were, you know, definitely very clearly evident. Increasingly indications of severe and acute malnutrition in many parts of the country, but particularly in Western province, which is one of the more remote areas of Papua New Guinea. There were scenes, you know, normally you won't see these kind of scenes. And actually when we managed to get one of the people, Sally Lloyd, who's working there and is part of the network of people, missionaries who are based at community level, when she came down to Moresby and showed some of the pictures, I think many people, including in Port Moresby, were quite shocked at the level of distress for families. From the first reports of the drought in the middle of 2015, the government actually had begun to start to respond together with partners. There were a series of assessment missions that were sent out. Government together with development partners going to four different locations, trying to assess where were the really severe needs, where were people able to cope and so on. The government allocated 203 million kina, which is roughly 70 million US dollars for the response. And this certainly isn't a small contribution. This is actually quite a significant contribution in Papua New Guinea. But as I think most of you will know, Papua New Guinea is an extremely high cost location. To travel to get supplies from Port Moresby up to some of the remote areas is extremely costly. The way that the government approached this was to allocate a large amount of that funding through the MPs. And I think many MPs, of course, did respond in their own constituencies and so on. And that has both positives and negatives. On the one hand, it definitely enables the local member to try and build the relationships with the constituencies. But there are obvious issues there as well about which people are local members most likely to support. Are they likely to get out into the most remote areas and so on? There are a whole series of issues that I think in the lesson learning workshops that are now being planned are starting to be talked about much more. And humanitarian partners, including the churches, the non-governmental organizations, PNG Red Cross, the bilaterals, including Australia, New Zealand, European Union as well, and the UN system started also supporting a lot of the humanitarian activities. Both in terms of assessment, but also in terms of starting the response in sectors like water and sanitation, agricultural recovery, health and education and so on. Now, in January, February of 2016, we did, there was a much more comprehensive countrywide assessment, which was done by the World Food Programme. And which they used a telephone survey methodology, as well as using the contacts from all of the development partners. And here I'd like to pay particular tribute to colleagues from the church partnership, but also Mike Burke, who is one of the leading agronomists working from Australia, working very closely with a range of church partners, including Matthew Kanua, ex-secretary of the Agriculture and Livestock Department here. Together, using all of our networks, a near sort of countrywide assessment was done in January, February. And there we found that 1.4 million people were in what we would regard as, you know, pretty severe food insecure. 162,000, 1.4 billion, sorry, in food insecure, and then 162,000 to up to about 200,000 people in what we would regard as extremely food insecure, where perhaps they're having to manage on perhaps just one meal a day or even skip the one meal a day. So this assessment, coupled with additional reports from partners, all pointed towards the need for a much more concerted longer term support, which would be required. And one of the things that that assessment also did was to look at some of the priority sectors. The disaster management team and the joint interagency coordination mechanism for humanitarian response in Papua New Guinea, right, really had been working from the previous year. But from April to September this year, there's been a lot more concerted effort. There was a, what we regarded as a surf appeal, which is an emergency appeal also, where in the first instance, looking at all of these priority sectors, we estimated that approximately to do this really effectively, up to $37 million would be required to be able to respond to this and to ensure that people were fed, were able to respond to this. And so we were able to look after themselves right up to the time where at least they could harvest, a full harvest, and be ready to plant for the next growing season. And the plan was to respond at least to the people with extreme food insecurity, the 162,000 or round about that figure in terms of World Food Programme's food security survey. We focus very much on what we regard as life saving food support and nutrition support. So those were the two key categories. But in addition, there was a range of work being done in the health sector, supporting health facilities in the wash, water and sanitation to try and improve clean water and hygiene practices and support for people, but also in agricultural recovery, thinking about seeds and tools that communities would need, and also thinking about early recovery work. Of the 37 million appeal, we received 39% of funding. To date, this work has now led to food response for that 162,000 food and nutrition support. And we're focusing very much in the high altitude areas, as well as in Milne Bay, the outer islands of Milne Bay, where there was also acute requirement for support. Other sectors have been left to a range of more traditional mechanisms, the church partnership, the bilaterals, also some of the foundations to support. One of the things to mention here is that unfortunately to date, we haven't been able to get a lot of the early recovery work, which is to try and tide communities over, not just to deal with the current crisis, but to help them for the longer term and to support their resilience efforts. But there's a range of needs still out there, but we're working with the funds that we receive. So in the food distribution points, and here we work very closely with the non-governmental organizations and particularly Care International, who were the implementing partner up in the highlands for this work. And I was fortunate to go up there about five weeks ago, six weeks ago, to see some of the food distribution taking place. The food distribution is primarily focused on support with rice, support for each family with very close work with the provincial authorities and with the National Disaster Management Center, working with local leaders as well, trying to ensure that every family has in those areas up to eight weeks of support. Which could at least tide them to the point where they could harvest the first set of their own, from their own gardens, a set of foods. And in this, we were particularly looking at the most vulnerable segments of the population, female headed households, the elderly, persons with disability, also thinking about very hard about how to ensure that it wasn't just men who controlled this food, but also women and children who had access to this food. So in addition to the blanket distribution, one of the issues that has surfaced, there is also issues around how to deal with conflict. Because inevitably, in a lot of these areas, particularly in remote areas, if you're not careful, it can lead to higher levels of conflict. And that's something that we've needed to navigate very closely. So we are supporting, the UN is supporting provincial government distribution of emergency food supplies in remote areas in Mogollu, as well as in Western District, as well as Anga and Hala. And in, as I said, the outer islands of Milne Bay. And it is an extremely costly operation because the logistics of these areas mean that you actually have to fly a lot of these supplies up to these remote areas. We're particularly thankful for one of the hallmarks of this, the way we have managed this, is really good partnership, not just between government and development partners and non-governmental organizations, but also with some of the businesses and particularly the foundations, the Oktadi Foundation, the Digicel Foundation that I'd like to mention, but also the Rotary Club, who have played an important role, as well as the sort of more traditional humanitarian partners, bilaterals, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, the USAID, and others working with the UN system and with the churches and so on. Rice distributions are taking place in remote coastal locations, as I mentioned, also in Milne Bay. And people living on the really remote, tactile areas. And one of the things we were able to do just a couple of months ago was also to take Ambassador Macharia, who is the Kenyan permanent representative to the United Nations, and the Secretary General's one of two climate envoys. He came to the Pacific and we were able to take him to Kiribina, out in the Trobriands, where he saw some of the really difficult struggles that islanders in these remote areas were really struggling with getting sort of access to clean water and so on. And it was really great to be able to take him there and actually see the impact of climate change in the longer run. Okay, so the UN clearly recognizes Papua New Guinea as a severely affected country by the El Nino globally. We have, you know, as I said, we've been fortunate in being able to also help to shine a bit more spotlight and highlight the impact on smaller communities and, you know, people living in remoter areas and on atolls and so on. And part of all of this also is helping us to now rethink with the national government about disaster planning for the medium and longer term. And there are a set of lessons that we're starting to learn and sharing across the development partners on some of this. And of course, you know, at a time when this is the first year of the Sustainable Development Goals, this is really important trying to get communities also really more aware of the Sustainable Development Goals and their own role in support in working with governments, but also with others in supporting better action towards the achievement of the SDGs. PNG response this time around, 17, more than 17 active humanitarian partners, including a lot of the donors, six priority sectors being supported. As I said, one of the new things this time around compared to 97 was the new partnerships, particularly involving private sector working with government, non-governmental organisations and the official aid agencies and so on. So far, we have supported up to 144,000 people during this particular, particularly in the last sort of this year, part of this year, the last five months. But actually, over the course of this, more than that number of people have been supported. A little bit about, you know, the need to continue this work, because clearly one of the big lessons of humanitarian action is that it doesn't end when the rains start. These things have longer term implications because they impact on people's health, their ability to support future development interventions in their own communities and so on. But there's definitely a lot of lessons to be learned from all of us about how we could improve further next time around.
