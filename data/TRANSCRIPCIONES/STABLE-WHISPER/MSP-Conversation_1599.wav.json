{"text": " In your press release, you stated that you're astonished to observe mounting evidence of a range of measures that have concurrently levied enormous pressure on Australian civic society. You met with First Nations peoples. What were your observations there? First of all, I would like to say that when I came to Australia, I was not expecting to see what I've seen, in fact. And as a result, my report is a report which is based on discussions I've had with so many defenders and officials. And the picture that it depicts on the situation of defenders is really grim. It's not that bad, as in other countries where defenders are killed and assassinated. But nonetheless, there is a huge pressure on defenders. And that's, for me, the key message of this report. And I wanted to warn the government of this atmosphere of fear, a chilling effect of different measures taken by the government to do their attention and to say there's a need for you to restore confidence on the civil society organizations. And, of course, I met with many indigenous people, not only in Kampala, but also when I traveled to Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, and elsewhere. And each time I got the same feeling that there is not really a real support from the government. They say that they are not consulted or not properly consulted. If they are consulted, then it's the government to decide whether or not those people should be consulted. And they are not to decide whether or not they are to appoint someone to be consulted. So they don't see consultation as a real process by which it would be linked to the final decision made by the government. Thank you. Really in need in some parts of the country, you see that they are in need. I was struck by my last discussion in Darwin, which is the place in which we have the great number of indigenous people. And many of them don't speak English. So when it comes to consultation, they say we don't understand the consultation. Or when we are consulted and we give a say, we say, for instance, no. And then companies or the government would come to meet with different families, individuals, to try to change the final decision of the community, which they don't accept. So they feel like they are not respected, not supported, and not funded. Why do you think this is? Did you get the impression that it was lack of political will in terms of the funding and also in terms of the consultations? Do you think that was lack of cross-cultural awareness? Probably. I mean, that's a trend by all governments, not only in Australia, but also in the rest of the world. People you want to consult with. And you don't take care of the most vulnerable, the most fragile people. And those are the people that you need to consult, not only the peak organizations, but the broad community. They have a right to say no or yes to measures that have been taken to be consulted on draft bill, draft load, practices that would affect also their daily fate. And that's something that they don't really feel comfortable with. So I don't really know why it is the case. But what I'm thinking is that it's not only in one part of the country that I heard that, but it's a cross-cutting theme that came across my consultation with many communities of indigenous people. And can this have flow-on effects like the physical health of the community and the mental health of the community if they're not consulted, lack of resources and things like that? Yes, it's not only because they want to have a say on the decision, but they feel marginalized and not respected. They have the culture of the country. That's a piece of land. That's history. That's heritage. And they say, we know better what is good for us. And why is it that specialists would come from outside to say what is good for us? I was also struck by the fact that the government would decide to establish new legal services to provide service to indigenous people while not consulting the people on their needs. And so they would abolish a legal center and then introduce a new one without either consult, nor the consultation of the population affected by the community legal services. So what would you suggest would be a better way for the government to approach the communities, the indigenous communities in Australia to alleviate these issues? For me, that would be A, to recognize the role of peak organizations that speak on behalf of their organizations. People have been elected by the communities, so they know the communities. They know that they are represented by peak bodies and sometimes peak bodies of peak bodies as well. And then there should be a formal process by which they could make sure that all of them are consulted. And not only those who are living in the main cities, but to take again the case of Darwin, many of the indigenous people don't live close to Alice Spring or to Darwin. So how to consult those people, how to make sure that they have an access to a final decision, or can they give a say on the decision? We need to find a way, they need to find a way to make sure that a broad consultation is organized on key issues, including those who are living in remote areas. So would language, like having translators and simple things like having people speaking in language, would that help? Of course. They say that there's a huge difference. I was struck again by the fact that when I met with a group of indigenous people, they were speaking of the role of companies. Companies would approach them to say they want to explore their piece of land. They would say no. And then they would come with a lot of specialists that would explain why it's important, and they don't understand. They don't understand the language of the specialist, and the specialist are not translated in the core languages of those populations. So how can they imagine they would understand? So they follow the sound advice of the community, the head of the community that they trust. But nonetheless, then you have companies and officials trying to get around the decision and to approach individuals to change. They are not respected at all. That's my main concern. And do you find that women within the indigenous communities are playing a large role in fighting for their rights? They are. They are playing a key role. I was struck by the fact that when we had meetings with indigenous people, they were speaking also loud and strong, were respected with their male colleagues. I don't think it's the case everywhere, but at least in those situations where we're consulted, they say that we are mothers, heads of families. They know what is good for the families, for the education, for the health of the children. And when they report their needs, for the needs of the families and not only from individuals, that's important. And so when you leave Australia today and you think back on the indigenous communities and the people that you've spoken about, what's your first thought that comes to mind? I mean, I have in mind the smiles, the eyes, the faces of the people I met with. I keep in mind the moving testimonies, stories that they told me. Like what? Like harassment by companies, for instance. Companies being targeted and trying to push them to sell the piece of land. This is mining? Mining companies? Mining companies. They play a tricky role in Australia. As I said, I also had a meeting with Mining Council Australia to discuss that and they denied, in fact, everything. They gave me a nice brochure saying that their membership have commitments to respect the rights of populations affected, communities, but in fact, when you speak with those people, you see that it's not the case. We also spoke with simple land owners that, in fact, became defenders because themselves as well have been directly targeted by companies saying that we simply want to explore your piece of land. They would say no and they cannot oppose to exploration. By law? By law. There is no impact assessment of the exploration in terms of human rights, in terms of affecting the environment, and then when they are consulted, they don't have access to the information and then it's too late. The mining companies would say, oh, there is a huge piece of mineral... Process. Yeah, yeah. And that will belong to us. We need to buy the country. So, I mean, the people are not really happy with the behavior of the company. Individual land owners gave testimonies and they become defenders by being attacked. By companies or by officials. And it's very often the case you are not a defender. It's not only the case in Australia. That's the case in Latin America. When peasants, farmers are simply harassed by companies, then they become defenders of their own rights and defend the rights of the communities. That's how they become defenders. And so will you be presenting these issues as part of your report? This is part of my report and hopefully on the issue of indigenous people. My colleague Vicky will be coming soon to Australia. That's the special rapporteur. That's the special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people. Why my concern was more on those who are protecting the rights of indigenous people. She will look directly into the situation. And believe me, I intend to speak with her on my findings, to have discussions on the place to meet. She knows pretty well who to meet. She has been advised. But nonetheless, I think that it would be good to have a discussion between the special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people. And the special rapporteur on the rights of human rights defenders. And just one last question. On the people that you're talking about who are defending their land, are they finding support? Or are they finding it difficult in terms of being human rights defenders on these issues? I mean, for them, that's difficult because they don't know the law. Lawyers are coming from companies or from the government. This could be remote communities. That could be remote communities. And then they have been told that this is the law. You cannot oppose the law. While they don't know the law, they don't have seen the law, they have no legal advice. That's costly. They don't dare to hire lawyers to advise them. And when they do realize that things might happen, it's too late. Things have happened. And for instance, the delay by which they could give a reply to a proper consultation has expired. So it's too late. And they have not received the proper advice from lawyers. And that's why they come to legal centers, to NGOs, to civil society organizations, to some lawyers that are working pro bono. And I must pay tribute to those lawyers in Australia that give also pro bono work for those communities. But sometimes and very often, it's too late for them. It's too late. The times have elapsed and it's too late. And I don't belong anymore to them. So can you see a way through on this problem from happening in the future? I mean, I do place hope on the state, not only on the government, because it's not a matter for this government, but it's a matter for the state to look at how to restore trust and confidence with all communities and defenders affected by those set of laws, measures, practice that have possibly been added to each other. And my feeling is that the current government doesn't understand that the picture that I've seen from Australia is grim for a moment. And things could change if they have the will to change. And in my report, I put a series of like 40 recommendations addressed to the government at federal level, also state level, companies as well, as defenders. And many of those concrete recommendations could be really easily implemented. And then things would probably change for defenders. Thank you.

[291, 13]}]}], "language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " In your press release, you stated that you're astonished to observe mounting evidence of a range of measures that have concurrently levied enormous pressure on Australian civic society. You met with First Nations peoples. What were your observations there? First of all, I would like to say that when I came to Australia, I was not expecting to see what I've seen, in fact. And as a result, my report is a report which is based on discussions I've had with so many defenders and officials. And the picture that it depicts on the situation of defenders is really grim. It's not that bad, as in other countries where defenders are killed and assassinated. But nonetheless, there is a huge pressure on defenders. And that's, for me, the key message of this report. And I wanted to warn the government of this atmosphere of fear, a chilling effect of different measures taken by the government to do their attention and to say there's a need for you to restore confidence on the civil society organizations. And, of course, I met with many indigenous people, not only in Kampala, but also when I traveled to Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, and elsewhere. And each time I got the same feeling that there is not really a real support from the government. They say that they are not consulted or not properly consulted. If they are consulted, then it's the government to decide whether or not those people should be consulted. And they are not to decide whether or not they are to appoint someone to be consulted. So they don't see consultation as a real process by which it would be linked to the final decision made by the government. Thank you. Really in need in some parts of the country, you see that they are in need. I was struck by my last discussion in Darwin, which is the place in which we have the great number of indigenous people. And many of them don't speak English. So when it comes to consultation, they say we don't understand the consultation. Or when we are consulted and we give a say, we say, for instance, no. And then companies or the government would come to meet with different families, individuals, to try to change the final decision of the community, which they don't accept. So they feel like they are not respected, not supported, and not funded. Why do you think this is? Did you get the impression that it was lack of political will in terms of the funding and also in terms of the consultations? Do you think that was lack of cross-cultural awareness? Probably. I mean, that's a trend by all governments, not only in Australia, but also in the rest of the world. People you want to consult with. And you don't take care of the most vulnerable, the most fragile people. And those are the people that you need to consult, not only the peak organizations, but the broad community. They have a right to say no or yes to measures that have been taken to be consulted on draft bill, draft load, practices that would affect also their daily fate. And that's something that they don't really feel comfortable with. So I don't really know why it is the case. But what I'm thinking is that it's not only in one part of the country that I heard that, but it's a cross-cutting theme that came across my consultation with many communities of indigenous people. And can this have flow-on effects like the physical health of the community and the mental health of the community if they're not consulted, lack of resources and things like that? Yes, it's not only because they want to have a say on the decision, but they feel marginalized and not respected. They have the culture of the country. That's a piece of land. That's history. That's heritage. And they say, we know better what is good for us. And why is it that specialists would come from outside to say what is good for us? I was also struck by the fact that the government would decide to establish new legal services to provide service to indigenous people while not consulting the people on their needs. And so they would abolish a legal center and then introduce a new one without either consult, nor the consultation of the population affected by the community legal services. So what would you suggest would be a better way for the government to approach the communities, the indigenous communities in Australia to alleviate these issues? For me, that would be A, to recognize the role of peak organizations that speak on behalf of their organizations. People have been elected by the communities, so they know the communities. They know that they are represented by peak bodies and sometimes peak bodies of peak bodies as well. And then there should be a formal process by which they could make sure that all of them are consulted. And not only those who are living in the main cities, but to take again the case of Darwin, many of the indigenous people don't live close to Alice Spring or to Darwin. So how to consult those people, how to make sure that they have an access to a final decision, or can they give a say on the decision? We need to find a way, they need to find a way to make sure that a broad consultation is organized on key issues, including those who are living in remote areas. So would language, like having translators and simple things like having people speaking in language, would that help? Of course. They say that there's a huge difference. I was struck again by the fact that when I met with a group of indigenous people, they were speaking of the role of companies. Companies would approach them to say they want to explore their piece of land. They would say no. And then they would come with a lot of specialists that would explain why it's important, and they don't understand. They don't understand the language of the specialist, and the specialist are not translated in the core languages of those populations. So how can they imagine they would understand? So they follow the sound advice of the community, the head of the community that they trust. But nonetheless, then you have companies and officials trying to get around the decision and to approach individuals to change. They are not respected at all. That's my main concern. And do you find that women within the indigenous communities are playing a large role in fighting for their rights? They are. They are playing a key role. I was struck by the fact that when we had meetings with indigenous people, they were speaking also loud and strong, were respected with their male colleagues. I don't think it's the case everywhere, but at least in those situations where we're consulted, they say that we are mothers, heads of families. They know what is good for the families, for the education, for the health of the children. And when they report their needs, for the needs of the families and not only from individuals, that's important. And so when you leave Australia today and you think back on the indigenous communities and the people that you've spoken about, what's your first thought that comes to mind? I mean, I have in mind the smiles, the eyes, the faces of the people I met with. I keep in mind the moving testimonies, stories that they told me. Like what? Like harassment by companies, for instance. Companies being targeted and trying to push them to sell the piece of land. This is mining? Mining companies? Mining companies. They play a tricky role in Australia. As I said, I also had a meeting with Mining Council Australia to discuss that and they denied, in fact, everything. They gave me a nice brochure saying that their membership have commitments to respect the rights of populations affected, communities, but in fact, when you speak with those people, you see that it's not the case. We also spoke with simple land owners that, in fact, became defenders because themselves as well have been directly targeted by companies saying that we simply want to explore your piece of land. They would say no and they cannot oppose to exploration. By law? By law. There is no impact assessment of the exploration in terms of human rights, in terms of affecting the environment, and then when they are consulted, they don't have access to the information and then it's too late. The mining companies would say, oh, there is a huge piece of mineral... Process. Yeah, yeah. And that will belong to us. We need to buy the country. So, I mean, the people are not really happy with the behavior of the company. Individual land owners gave testimonies and they become defenders by being attacked. By companies or by officials. And it's very often the case you are not a defender. It's not only the case in Australia. That's the case in Latin America. When peasants, farmers are simply harassed by companies, then they become defenders of their own rights and defend the rights of the communities. That's how they become defenders. And so will you be presenting these issues as part of your report? This is part of my report and hopefully on the issue of indigenous people. My colleague Vicky will be coming soon to Australia. That's the special rapporteur. That's the special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people. Why my concern was more on those who are protecting the rights of indigenous people. She will look directly into the situation. And believe me, I intend to speak with her on my findings, to have discussions on the place to meet. She knows pretty well who to meet. She has been advised. But nonetheless, I think that it would be good to have a discussion between the special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people. And the special rapporteur on the rights of human rights defenders. And just one last question. On the people that you're talking about who are defending their land, are they finding support? Or are they finding it difficult in terms of being human rights defenders on these issues? I mean, for them, that's difficult because they don't know the law. Lawyers are coming from companies or from the government. This could be remote communities. That could be remote communities. And then they have been told that this is the law. You cannot oppose the law. While they don't know the law, they don't have seen the law, they have no legal advice. That's costly. They don't dare to hire lawyers to advise them. And when they do realize that things might happen, it's too late. Things have happened. And for instance, the delay by which they could give a reply to a proper consultation has expired. So it's too late. And they have not received the proper advice from lawyers. And that's why they come to legal centers, to NGOs, to civil society organizations, to some lawyers that are working pro bono. And I must pay tribute to those lawyers in Australia that give also pro bono work for those communities. But sometimes and very often, it's too late for them. It's too late. The times have elapsed and it's too late. And I don't belong anymore to them. So can you see a way through on this problem from happening in the future? I mean, I do place hope on the state, not only on the government, because it's not a matter for this government, but it's a matter for the state to look at how to restore trust and confidence with all communities and defenders affected by those set of laws, measures, practice that have possibly been added to each other. And my feeling is that the current government doesn't understand that the picture that I've seen from Australia is grim for a moment. And things could change if they have the will to change. And in my report, I put a series of like 40 recommendations addressed to the government at federal level, also state level, companies as well, as defenders. And many of those concrete recommendations could be really easily implemented. And then things would probably change for defenders. Thank you.
