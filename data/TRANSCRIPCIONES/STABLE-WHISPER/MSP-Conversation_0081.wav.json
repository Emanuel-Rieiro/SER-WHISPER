{"text": " Hello again, welcome to another episode of Two Peas on a Pod. We're actually in the same room this time, after a very long time. And today we're going to be talking about Mad Max Fury Road. We just got a chance to watch this, and this will have some spoilers in it, so if you haven't seen the film, definitely turn this off now. But, yeah man, what did you think of it? I loved it. I thought it was great. Oh man, it's going to take a few days for this boner to go down, I'll tell you what. But, I don't know, it was, I mean, it's going to be hard to beat, in my opinion, for movies this summer. At least for me. But, yeah man, I loved it. Yeah, it's non-stop. I mean, it starts, you know, the action doesn't let up, barely, throughout the whole thing. Not at all. It's directed by George Miller, the same guy that did the first three films, which I didn't even realize that when I went into it. I had, like, avoided all trailers. The only thing I saw was the first trailer that came out, you know, a year ago, or whenever it was. Just because, you know, like I'd heard people talking about the guitar that spits fire and stuff like that. But, I'm sure it's in the trailer somewhere, but I haven't even, you know. That was way better than what I was expecting it to be. It was fun. It was a damn fun movie. What did you think of Tom Hardy? I thought he was good. I thought he was really good as Max, you know. Max has always been quiet. Yeah. He hasn't said much, so you don't hear him say anything for a while. Yeah. But, he was fine, but he was, to me, he was much more Charlize Theron's movie than his. Really? You know, just, she was the focal point of it. Yeah. I'm not saying he was just relegated to, like, a cameo. He wasn't. But, it was more about her. She was the driving force behind it. He just tagged along. She did a great job. She did. As always, really. You know, I remember when they announced this movie. I mean, like five years ago now, you know, when they announced the cast, I was, kind of, you know, kind of apprehensive about her being in it. You know, just because I didn't really know the plot or anything at that point. So, I basically thought that she was going to be playing the Max character. Oh, yeah. And I thought it was going to be like, you know, a complete remake. But, no, I enjoyed what they did. I mean, as far as I know, it takes place after Beyond Thunderdome. That's the impression I get, too. Yeah. Even though they really don't, they don't hold it. They don't allude to the others. Yeah. This is very much a standalone movie. Yeah. It can easily stand alone, yeah. But, yeah, the visuals of the movie were the best part about it. It was just fantastic. I mean, some of it was like a painting on the screen. It was beautiful. That's not to say that, you know, the story wasn't good. It was a good story. You know, just straightforward. It wasn't full of a bunch of crap. It was, straightforward, like a redemption kind of story. And, you know, I think George Miller knows what he does well and he sticks with it. The way we're looking, this movie's been in production for, what, almost 20 years now? Roughly, yeah. Some, you know, some form of production. His concept armor back to 1997. So, yeah, I mean, he's had time to think about what he wants. And, you know, I was reading that it was supposed to be made, you know, I think like right around 2000 with Mel Gibson. But I was reading that it was sidetracked because of the, you know, the troubles in the Middle East, the wars and stuff. Oh, yeah. So, I don't know if, is that because that's where they filmed this stuff over there? I'm just not sure. I don't know. It may not have been something people would have wanted to see right after, you know, not a one-man. You could be right. You could be right. Even though I don't agree with that at all. But, uh, it's in Australia. I don't know if the troubles in the Middle East really affected Australia all that much, but I could be wrong. I don't know. You know, some people, like, the whole thing about oil, even though oil didn't really play a part in this one, they'll flip the fuck out about it. I remember when, um, right before 9-11 occurred, I think, or after that, but before the, invasion of Iraq, they had a movie that was going to be called Iraq Attack, A-R-A-C-H, and they turned it into Ain't Like It Freaks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they, all because Iraq sounded too much like Iraq, you know, the country. You know, I'd heard that before. I never put that together that that was the reason why they changed the name. I don't like either title. I think they both sound stupid. Iraq Attack is not that great either. It's a stupid movie. Even though I liked it. It's got that Scarlett Johansson in it, though. Is she in it? Yeah. Well, I just remember that, uh, what's, David Arquette. Yeah. She's, she's like a, I don't know, young, young teenage girl in it. Did you happen to see that picture I sent you earlier? The, uh, it was the Christopher Walken. Yeah, yeah, you sent me that. Wasn't it, wasn't it Frankie? Yeah. He looks just like her. Yeah. Well, now you're going to see people put memes online of, uh, you know, her looking like Christopher Walken as an old man. Christopher Walken as a, as a young man. I mean, this is like early on in his career, like probably pre-Deer Hunter, I'm just thinking. Yeah, I would think so. Spot on. He's never been so attractive in my eyes. Uh, uh, but, um, sorry for derailing this area. Filling locations. Namibia. Yeah. On the bottom there. That's the only one I'm seeing that, that was anywhere not in Australia. Namibia. Uh, that's probably what they used for those desert shots. I would think so. When they, uh, you know, were getting close, or when they thought they were going to the green, the green place. Mm-hmm. And found out it was not going to happen. So, but, uh. I have to do a shout-out. I have to do a shout-out, though, in this movie to the motherfucker in red who kept playing the guitar the entire fucking time. I laughed every single time he showed up. Because, like, I was telling Jason, I was like, it would have been funnier for me if he didn't even have a guitar. He was just playing air guitar the entire time. Because he was rocking the fuck out the whole time. Totally. And the, the, the whole truck, it seemed like the only purpose was to have like eight drum players. Yeah. Or twelve. I don't have many that were on there. It was like a band on there. Tons of guys playing the drums and the guitar player on the front with, you know, amps and speakers everywhere. Which, it was just hilarious. And it just, you know, amped it up for me. I loved it. Mm-hmm. You know, just totally ridiculous and out there. Which is, you know, one of the reasons why I love this movie so much. I, uh, I told Dale when we got out that it was like, you know, it's what I liked about Road Warrior, but, you know, just amped up. Yeah. Like crazy. And that's exactly what I wanted to see. I mean, that's what it is, man. It's like Road Warrior and they're on the road doing battle, the majority of the movie. Which is cool, you know. It's what he would have done, I think, with Road Warrior if he'd had the budget at the time. Yeah, yeah. And the special effects. But, um, the, the costume designs, I mean, the, the characters, I just love it. It's, uh, lots of homoerotic stuff in there that I thought was pretty funny. Like the, uh, the women, you know, being milked like cattle in the beginning. And then the, uh, the weird, you know, midget guy without any legs. That dude was Mr. Wump. And, uh. I wonder what his actual name is. That's like Vern Schwoyer's, like, ugly twin brother. But, um, and then the, the guy that was rubbing his nipples the whole time. He had it nowhere. That was really, see, I kept thinking of South Park when they had that episode. Where they kept rubbing their nipples. The cable guys. Like Nambla? The Nambla thing? No, it was when they were, uh, dealing with Comcast. Every time they'd go complaining, they'd just sit there and rub their nipples. That was really funny. And he had horrible gout. Oh, man. It just kept, kept revealing with that guy. You saw his nose at first. Yeah. Then he got out and he saw his nipple rings, like, you know, just, he's wearing clothes, but he has, like, holes cut out for his nipples in there, like, attached by a chain. On the outside of his clothing. And then you get to see his, you know, huge, uh, I don't know, growth on his foot, elephantitis, or whatever the hell that is. But, uh, awesome. And that comes into play later on, too. With the, uh, gas pedal. Yeah, it does. I love that, too. Like, so many moments that were just so subtle and, you know, just so perfect and, you know, hilarious to me. That, you know, just a, just a great balance, you know? I mean, there's a little bit of drama in there. Just, just the right amount of drama. You know, not, I mean, very, very thin, but enough to, you know, get you there. It's not heavy-handed at all. Exactly. It easily could have done that. Easily could have been. Oh. And most movies would be that way. Yeah. They would, you know, try to scale down the action and pump that, you know, pump up the love story aspect of it. Which I'm glad they ended that the way they did, too. Um, just perfect. I mean, damn near perfect film in my eyes. I mean, you know, blown away. I like how Max was, because he, he was pretty true to what I've seen, you know, of him before. He doesn't want glory. He just wants to be left the fuck alone. Yeah. Um, and, yeah, like you were saying, the women, you know, of course, this whole thing is full of spoilers, but, that scene where he walks around the truck and sees those beautiful girls. Yeah. It's like, because all the colors in the movie before had been like, blacks, oranges, just dreary nastiness, you know. Pustules and polyps and all that. Suddenly there's this beautiful woman wearing all white. Perfect contrast. Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, not only are they wearing all white, but they're spraying each other down with a water hose. Yeah. And that doesn't help. I mean, that doesn't hurt things at all. No. But, I mean, they're all like, when I saw them, I immediately thought, like, supermodel. Because they're all like, six foot three, like, all legs. And, uh, but, you know, we looked them up and they actually, a couple of them or three of them actually are like, Victoria's Secret models. So, it's right on the head. The one girl with the fucking blonde hair, man, she looked like she was six foot five or taller, man. Yeah. I don't know if she was wearing, like, huge lifts or something, but, no, that was really, I mean, that was another moment that I laughed a lot at, just because it was like, you know, you didn't expect to see that around the corner. No, no, not at all. And he's just like, dumbfounded. Yeah. Like, you know, most guys then, you know, would have just probably lost it. You know, he probably hadn't seen a beautiful woman since his wife died, probably. Oh, yeah, no doubt. Because you wouldn't expect that at that time. And that's, I think that helps you understand why the, uh, the bad guy, what did they call him? I can't remember his name, but he would explain why he would go through the Lansingwood. To get them back. And Mortan Joe, or Morton Joe, whatever you call him. Yeah. I don't know if they ever called him by name. They called him something. I don't think it was that. But, that's played by Hugh Keyes Byrne, who we found out was, uh, Toe Cutter in the first film, the first Mad Max, which, that's really cool to me. Yeah, it is. That they're using people from the original films, you know. It feels really genuine. Like, he stayed true to, you know, his original idea. Yeah. You know, he didn't compromise, you know, which I think is really great. You know, he used a lot of... I was surprised he didn't have to, you know. Yeah. That's what I was surprised about. He probably wouldn't have made it if he had to compromise too much. Maybe why he didn't for so long. Yeah. You know, one of the reasons. I mean, uh... Did you see the budget, by any chance? I didn't pay attention to it. Um... It, uh... But, I mean, lots of Australians and actors and actresses in there. And, you know, I'd like to see that. What the fuck is the budget here? Here we go. Budget, $150 million. That's not a lot for a movie of that scale. That's not a lot. And it made 44 opening weekend in the U.S., so... It should be able to make that up pretty easily, don't you think? You would think a movie like that would do well overseas. I don't see why not. It'll do well in Australia. Australia, definitely. China, he set shit up. Yeah, I mean, it's all action. Big action movies. And you know what? I was hearing that the 3D, you know, obviously this film is shown in 3D, which... If you have an opportunity, I wouldn't say see it in 3D. Because we saw it in 2D. Just because I don't like 3D anyway, but it didn't seem like anything you would benefit from anyway. But, uh... 3D is really big overseas. Have you heard that? Like, really big in the Asian countries? That's why a lot of studios want to push that. Even though it's not that big here. I mean... But, I guess comparatively, it's not that big. But it's huge in other countries.", "segments": [{"start": 0.2, "end": 2.98, "text": " Hello again, welcome to another episode of Two Peas on a Pod.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [2425, 797, 11, 2928, 281,

a Pod. We're actually in the same room this time, after a very long time. And today we're going to be talking about Mad Max Fury Road. We just got a chance to watch this, and this will have some spoilers in it, so if you haven't seen the film, definitely turn this off now. But, yeah man, what did you think of it? I loved it. I thought it was great. Oh man, it's going to take a few days for this boner to go down, I'll tell you what. But, I don't know, it was, I mean, it's going to be hard to beat, in my opinion, for movies this summer. At least for me. But, yeah man, I loved it. Yeah, it's non-stop. I mean, it starts, you know, the action doesn't let up, barely, throughout the whole thing. Not at all. It's directed by George Miller, the same guy that did the first three films, which I didn't even realize that when I went into it. I had, like, avoided all trailers. The only thing I saw was the first trailer that came out, you know, a year ago, or whenever it was. Just because, you know, like I'd heard people talking about the guitar that spits fire and stuff like that. But, I'm sure it's in the trailer somewhere, but I haven't even, you know. That was way better than what I was expecting it to be. It was fun. It was a damn fun movie. What did you think of Tom Hardy? I thought he was good. I thought he was really good as Max, you know. Max has always been quiet. Yeah. He hasn't said much, so you don't hear him say anything for a while. Yeah. But, he was fine, but he was, to me, he was much more Charlize Theron's movie than his. Really? You know, just, she was the focal point of it. Yeah. I'm not saying he was just relegated to, like, a cameo. He wasn't. But, it was more about her. She was the driving force behind it. He just tagged along. She did a great job. She did. As always, really. You know, I remember when they announced this movie. I mean, like five years ago now, you know, when they announced the cast, I was, kind of, you know, kind of apprehensive about her being in it. You know, just because I didn't really know the plot or anything at that point. So, I basically thought that she was going to be playing the Max character. Oh, yeah. And I thought it was going to be like, you know, a complete remake. But, no, I enjoyed what they did. I mean, as far as I know, it takes place after Beyond Thunderdome. That's the impression I get, too. Yeah. Even though they really don't, they don't hold it. They don't allude to the others. Yeah. This is very much a standalone movie. Yeah. It can easily stand alone, yeah. But, yeah, the visuals of the movie were the best part about it. It was just fantastic. I mean, some of it was like a painting on the screen. It was beautiful. That's not to say that, you know, the story wasn't good. It was a good story. You know, just straightforward. It wasn't full of a bunch of crap. It was, straightforward, like a redemption kind of story. And, you know, I think George Miller knows what he does well and he sticks with it. The way we're looking, this movie's been in production for, what, almost 20 years now? Roughly, yeah. Some, you know, some form of production. His concept armor back to 1997. So, yeah, I mean, he's had time to think about what he wants. And, you know, I was reading that it was supposed to be made, you know, I think like right around 2000 with Mel Gibson. But I was reading that it was sidetracked because of the, you know, the troubles in the Middle East, the wars and stuff. Oh, yeah. So, I don't know if, is that because that's where they filmed this stuff over there? I'm just not sure. I don't know. It may not have been something people would have wanted to see right after, you know, not a one-man. You could be right. You could be right. Even though I don't agree with that at all. But, uh, it's in Australia. I don't know if the troubles in the Middle East really affected Australia all that much, but I could be wrong. I don't know. You know, some people, like, the whole thing about oil, even though oil didn't really play a part in this one, they'll flip the fuck out about it. I remember when, um, right before 9-11 occurred, I think, or after that, but before the, invasion of Iraq, they had a movie that was going to be called Iraq Attack, A-R-A-C-H, and they turned it into Ain't Like It Freaks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they, all because Iraq sounded too much like Iraq, you know, the country. You know, I'd heard that before. I never put that together that that was the reason why they changed the name. I don't like either title. I think they both sound stupid. Iraq Attack is not that great either. It's a stupid movie. Even though I liked it. It's got that Scarlett Johansson in it, though. Is she in it? Yeah. Well, I just remember that, uh, what's, David Arquette. Yeah. She's, she's like a, I don't know, young, young teenage girl in it. Did you happen to see that picture I sent you earlier? The, uh, it was the Christopher Walken. Yeah, yeah, you sent me that. Wasn't it, wasn't it Frankie? Yeah. He looks just like her. Yeah. Well, now you're going to see people put memes online of, uh, you know, her looking like Christopher Walken as an old man. Christopher Walken as a, as a young man. I mean, this is like early on in his career, like probably pre-Deer Hunter, I'm just thinking. Yeah, I would think so. Spot on. He's never been so attractive in my eyes. Uh, uh, but, um, sorry for derailing this area. Filling locations. Namibia. Yeah. On the bottom there. That's the only one I'm seeing that, that was anywhere not in Australia. Namibia. Uh, that's probably what they used for those desert shots. I would think so. When they, uh, you know, were getting close, or when they thought they were going to the green, the green place. Mm-hmm. And found out it was not going to happen. So, but, uh. I have to do a shout-out. I have to do a shout-out, though, in this movie to the motherfucker in red who kept playing the guitar the entire fucking time. I laughed every single time he showed up. Because, like, I was telling Jason, I was like, it would have been funnier for me if he didn't even have a guitar. He was just playing air guitar the entire time. Because he was rocking the fuck out the whole time. Totally. And the, the, the whole truck, it seemed like the only purpose was to have like eight drum players. Yeah. Or twelve. I don't have many that were on there. It was like a band on there. Tons of guys playing the drums and the guitar player on the front with, you know, amps and speakers everywhere. Which, it was just hilarious. And it just, you know, amped it up for me. I loved it. Mm-hmm. You know, just totally ridiculous and out there. Which is, you know, one of the reasons why I love this movie so much. I, uh, I told Dale when we got out that it was like, you know, it's what I liked about Road Warrior, but, you know, just amped up. Yeah. Like crazy. And that's exactly what I wanted to see. I mean, that's what it is, man. It's like Road Warrior and they're on the road doing battle, the majority of the movie. Which is cool, you know. It's what he would have done, I think, with Road Warrior if he'd had the budget at the time. Yeah, yeah. And the special effects. But, um, the, the costume designs, I mean, the, the characters, I just love it. It's, uh, lots of homoerotic stuff in there that I thought was pretty funny. Like the, uh, the women, you know, being milked like cattle in the beginning. And then the, uh, the weird, you know, midget guy without any legs. That dude was Mr. Wump. And, uh. I wonder what his actual name is. That's like Vern Schwoyer's, like, ugly twin brother. But, um, and then the, the guy that was rubbing his nipples the whole time. He had it nowhere. That was really, see, I kept thinking of South Park when they had that episode. Where they kept rubbing their nipples. The cable guys. Like Nambla? The Nambla thing? No, it was when they were, uh, dealing with Comcast. Every time they'd go complaining, they'd just sit there and rub their nipples. That was really funny. And he had horrible gout. Oh, man. It just kept, kept revealing with that guy. You saw his nose at first. Yeah. Then he got out and he saw his nipple rings, like, you know, just, he's wearing clothes, but he has, like, holes cut out for his nipples in there, like, attached by a chain. On the outside of his clothing. And then you get to see his, you know, huge, uh, I don't know, growth on his foot, elephantitis, or whatever the hell that is. But, uh, awesome. And that comes into play later on, too. With the, uh, gas pedal. Yeah, it does. I love that, too. Like, so many moments that were just so subtle and, you know, just so perfect and, you know, hilarious to me. That, you know, just a, just a great balance, you know? I mean, there's a little bit of drama in there. Just, just the right amount of drama. You know, not, I mean, very, very thin, but enough to, you know, get you there. It's not heavy-handed at all. Exactly. It easily could have done that. Easily could have been. Oh. And most movies would be that way. Yeah. They would, you know, try to scale down the action and pump that, you know, pump up the love story aspect of it. Which I'm glad they ended that the way they did, too. Um, just perfect. I mean, damn near perfect film in my eyes. I mean, you know, blown away. I like how Max was, because he, he was pretty true to what I've seen, you know, of him before. He doesn't want glory. He just wants to be left the fuck alone. Yeah. Um, and, yeah, like you were saying, the women, you know, of course, this whole thing is full of spoilers, but, that scene where he walks around the truck and sees those beautiful girls. Yeah. It's like, because all the colors in the movie before had been like, blacks, oranges, just dreary nastiness, you know. Pustules and polyps and all that. Suddenly there's this beautiful woman wearing all white. Perfect contrast. Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, not only are they wearing all white, but they're spraying each other down with a water hose. Yeah. And that doesn't help. I mean, that doesn't hurt things at all. No. But, I mean, they're all like, when I saw them, I immediately thought, like, supermodel. Because they're all like, six foot three, like, all legs. And, uh, but, you know, we looked them up and they actually, a couple of them or three of them actually are like, Victoria's Secret models. So, it's right on the head. The one girl with the fucking blonde hair, man, she looked like she was six foot five or taller, man. Yeah. I don't know if she was wearing, like, huge lifts or something, but, no, that was really, I mean, that was another moment that I laughed a lot at, just because it was like, you know, you didn't expect to see that around the corner. No, no, not at all. And he's just like, dumbfounded. Yeah. Like, you know, most guys then, you know, would have just probably lost it. You know, he probably hadn't seen a beautiful woman since his wife died, probably. Oh, yeah, no doubt. Because you wouldn't expect that at that time. And that's, I think that helps you understand why the, uh, the bad guy, what did they call him? I can't remember his name, but he would explain why he would go through the Lansingwood. To get them back. And Mortan Joe, or Morton Joe, whatever you call him. Yeah. I don't know if they ever called him by name. They called him something. I don't think it was that. But, that's played by Hugh Keyes Byrne, who we found out was, uh, Toe Cutter in the first film, the first Mad Max, which, that's really cool to me. Yeah, it is. That they're using people from the original films, you know. It feels really genuine. Like, he stayed true to, you know, his original idea. Yeah. You know, he didn't compromise, you know, which I think is really great. You know, he used a lot of... I was surprised he didn't have to, you know. Yeah. That's what I was surprised about. He probably wouldn't have made it if he had to compromise too much. Maybe why he didn't for so long. Yeah. You know, one of the reasons. I mean, uh... Did you see the budget, by any chance? I didn't pay attention to it. Um... It, uh... But, I mean, lots of Australians and actors and actresses in there. And, you know, I'd like to see that. What the fuck is the budget here? Here we go. Budget, $150 million. That's not a lot for a movie of that scale. That's not a lot. And it made 44 opening weekend in the U.S., so... It should be able to make that up pretty easily, don't you think? You would think a movie like that would do well overseas. I don't see why not. It'll do well in Australia. Australia, definitely. China, he set shit up. Yeah, I mean, it's all action. Big action movies. And you know what? I was hearing that the 3D, you know, obviously this film is shown in 3D, which... If you have an opportunity, I wouldn't say see it in 3D. Because we saw it in 2D. Just because I don't like 3D anyway, but it didn't seem like anything you would benefit from anyway. But, uh... 3D is really big overseas. Have you heard that? Like, really big in the Asian countries? That's why a lot of studios want to push that. Even though it's not that big here. I mean... But, I guess comparatively, it's not that big. But it's huge in other countries.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.2, "end": 2.98, "text": " Hello again, welcome to another episode of Two Peas on a Pod.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [2425, 797, 11,
