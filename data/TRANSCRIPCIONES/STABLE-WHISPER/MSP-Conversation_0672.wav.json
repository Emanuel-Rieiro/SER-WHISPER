{"text": " are bringing you Fansplaining. Welcome to the, oh, six? Number six? Six. It's the episode of Fansplaining, the podcast by, for, and about fandom. This podcast is, this particular one is titled The Meme Librarian, and we are going to have the eponymous Amanda Brennan as our guest, and she's the last member of our San Diego Comic-Con panel for us to interview. And after that, I don't even know who we're going to talk to. We don't, this was the only five people we know. Of course, we're going to talk to some wonderful people. Our next guest is going to be Ebony Elizabeth Thomas, and we're really excited about that. All right, we know one other person. Amanda. But actually, even before we get to Amanda, we had our first reader audio comment, listener audio comment. They're not readers. We're just literally rubbing our hands together in joy right now, or possibly evilness. I don't know what that is. Joy. It's joy. Okay, joy. Joy. Cool. Yeah, I really like it. Okay, so let's play the comment for our lovely listeners, and then talk about it. Okay. Hey, I'm Elsa, Buffer Overon on Tumblr. I've really been enjoying your podcast, but there's a couple things that I keep chewing on that I wanted to talk about. At one point in the first episode, Flourish seems to be saying that there's a straight line between corporations seeing fandom works as earned media, i.e., a source of market research and free advertising, and the end of the Harry Potter era cease and desist letters. And I guess more broadly, the end of the massive copyright overreach of the 90s and 2000s. And on one hand, the free advertising idea has been around for a while, particularly in terms of peer-to-peer, social network-based sharing of media. And it seems to have gotten a lot more traction than the non-commercial fair use argument. It probably is true that the flourishing of fandom spaces has had much more to do with corporate self-interest than any legal victories by the OTW. But I don't think that's something to be celebrated. It actually feels very precarious. And then in episode two, Meredith Levine was talking about the production cycle of media, and basically that consumerism, like fans buying stuff, is how we get canon, which we need in order to get fan works. And maybe I'm being utopian here, but it feels like fanfic is an ecosystem that's really not that dependent on the canon. I mean, to write good fanfic, the author needs to be really engaged with the original canon. And if you love a show or a book or a song, I think you have to pay for it and probably also buy copies for all your friends, because that's how the people who are making commercial media get paid. But as a reader, I don't need to love or even necessarily to watch like Supernatural or Teen Wolf or any of the Marvel movies to appreciate the fic. Particularly when you're talking about a lot of the common AUs and tropes, all you need are a few good gifs of cute boys looking longly at each other, and that's enough to launch a thousand ships. But I feel like what Meredith is saying is that if we don't participate in advertising or making ourselves available for data mining for mega media companies, then they'll shut off the tap of the angsty homoerotic bromances, and then the well of fanfic will run dry, which I don't think is true. Thanks. Oh my god, such a great comment. I was so happy with this. Okay, so there's two parts to the comment. Let's go in order. The first one was calling me out. I kind of felt like all of it was calling you out. What? Yeah, she clearly hates you and thinks I'm great, even though she doesn't acknowledge that we have the same perspective. We should run a poll. Which of your two lovely co-hosts do you like better? No, but actually, I thought that she was making a good point. I also actually agree with her. It's very precarious that fan works pretty much are not legally challenged just because corporations see them as beneficial. I think she's right. It's precarious. It's precarious and it sucks. The positive symbiosis between fans and media corporations right now is kind of predicated on the fact that, I don't know, everyone's playing nice. Say that Snowy Ice Dragon or whatever, Snow Queen's Ice Dragon, I believe, E.L. James had written Fifty Shades of Grey, and Stephanie Meyer was deeply offended by BDSM. That would have been such a different story if that had sued her. Right. Talk about them challenging and also being allowed to be unconventional or taboo or whatever. That hasn't actually come up against these media corporations. So everyone's just playing kind of nice and vanilla with them. Not in a big way. You said not in a big way? Yeah, it hasn't come up in a big way. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I think that we are maybe headed in that direction, but in order for that to happen, I think, among other things, we would need to see a literary elite take fan works more seriously. In order to publish the more challenging fan works. Right now, the things that are getting published in fan works are like Sexy BDSM Sexy Time and My Date with One Direction, which, let me tell you, I love My Date with One Direction. I would go on a date with all of One Direction, preferably at once. But no one's going to publish the more challenging stuff that really does sort of go against norms until you see people taking it seriously as literature and publishing. But I don't even think it has to be that. All right, so we had Wattpad talking about contests. What movie studios want to have with their fan fiction? What happens when people start writing stories that really offend them? I mean, I feel like we talked about this a lot. But they already do that. For their contests? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess because there's no power there. That's it. The person submitting it is a mick and munt, right? And that's why I'm saying that the day that somebody writes a fan fic that really, truly challenges... I mean, this is the When Done Gone issue. The reason the When Done Gone was a big deal was that the When Done Gone was a literary work that had a powerful publisher behind it. Literary estate of Gone with the Wind. And when we see a fan fic, you know, on the front page of The Atlantic, in a discussion of like... When does The Atlantic publish fiction on the front page? No, I mean, a discussion about it. The way that Kenny Goldsmith's poetry is getting debated in the pages of The Atlantic. When we see that happening, when we see that conversation happening, then that's when we're going to have a fight. There has to be some kind of like cultural power behind fan fic that's more than just people on the internet. That's giving too much. Too much credit to the publishing industry and literary establishment. I think that this could happen just as easily with movies and television. I don't think this has to have anything to do with books. Maybe. I don't know. But I'm not actually sure that we're like building up to the first ever... Because like I said, the When Done Gone is a great example of something like this happening. Sure, but that's not a part of modern networked media fandom either. It's not, but it's not. That's true. Score. Anyway, I think the something is we agree that this is a precarious position. I'm naturally more inclined to be a pragmatist than anything. You're a capitalist because you love money. I do love money. God, I love it so much. I'm more inclined to be a pragmatist than some people, perhaps than Elizabeth. I thought you were about to subtweet me and then you just said my name out loud. I don't need to subtweet you. So that's my response to that. To that part of it. To that part of it, because then there was the other part, is about what Meredith was saying. I was really pleased that Elsa brought this up because, and I think I mentioned this and I don't think Meredith would mind me saying this because I think she knows we come from very... Actually, I said that Meredith on Twitter the other day. I think you and I come from the exact opposite ends of the spectrum and we can both learn by meaning somewhere in the middle. I think that's an adult way to describe that. But when I was editing the Meredith episode, the whole time I was like, why didn't I say anything? I disagree with everything you're saying. I remember at one point, we were pushing back on something and she was like, well, you guys come from fan fiction and that's a big, big, but it's not everything. And she was kind of saying because we were coming from the fan fiction perspective, we didn't have a full sense of the kind of perspective that she was coming from. Well, I do think that she comes from very much more the video end of things. So I don't think that I share the same perspective as she does. It's true that one part that we did cut out was the part where she talked about her history with Harry Potter and it was so completely different from mine or yours. The way that she interacted with those books. I encountered this too when I went to, say, GeekyCon. The way that a lot of people there were engaging with the books was very different than people who were in transformative fandom. It's not better or worse. It's just different. The big question that came up with that was she seemed to be saying, Meredith seemed to be saying, we as fans needed to continue to give our money to mega media conglomerates in order to receive back the stuff we're fans of. And I thought that Elsa's point was really nuanced saying that there's a difference between writers and readers and how much they're reliant on canon. From my perspective, I don't know that I would say we have to give money to big mega media corporations in order to get canon because I think that there's a lot of things that are smaller that can produce canon. For instance, the Lizzie Bennet diaries. I mean, that was not a mega multi-million dollar media conglomerate. It's not the Avengers franchise. But I do think that there have to be source texts that a lot of people are familiar with. In order for fandom to foment, right? Because in order for readers to be showing up there, you may never have watched Supernatural, but you know what it is. And that's why you know to look for fan fiction about it. So you agree, we both agree with Elsa on this point, right? I feel like there's so many people who join fandoms kind of with a distant connection to the source material because you get so invested in the fandom, right? I agree with her on that point. I just think that there has to be like a critical mass in order for there to be a fandom. Yeah, but I definitely, not me personally, but I've definitely encountered a lot of people who will read a good story in any fandom and they don't care about the source material. All I'm saying is that I think that for writers, there needs to be a community around the source material that's large enough for them to keep engaging. I don't think it has to be incredibly large. It doesn't have to be the size of Supernatural or Sherlock or One Direction. No, not at all. But there does have to be some amount of foment. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a mega media conglomerate, but I do think that there has to be some amount of, it can't just be entirely one-to-one because then it's no longer fan fiction. I just started, you know, it's interesting. So I just started rereading one of my favorite Torchwood fan fiction authors. I follow her on Tumblr, but she rarely posts. And two days ago, she posted a new story. She barely written anything in the last few years because that show ended and a lot of people left. And that has nothing to do with the production cycle. That show is done. Even though they didn't officially end it, it's over. I think that consumerist fandom, it's obviously huge. And like I went to Comic-Con and I was like, oh, here it is. But it's like, it appeals to me as someone to study it, but not to participate in it. I see both sides. I see Elsa's point. But I also feel like, again, like you cannot make an Avengers movie without a huge budget. And in order for that huge budget to be justified, you have to have a lot of people buying into it, paying for it. It's giving their money to mega conglomerates. Save our show campaigns means like going out and buying what, what, what show is it? Was it Chuck that went to Subway and bought like Chuck, Chuck, Chuck fandom, Chuck, they did save our show campaign. And they like went and bought Subway sandwiches because Subway was the major advertiser and they got another season of the show, right? Like it's, it's completely, I think that's what Meriden's talking about. I don't want another season of the show. I don't want another season of Torchwood. I'm going to fuck it up again. Incredible fan works. By the time this is like, this is like my feelings about the X-Files where I'm like on this constant roller coaster. Oh, it looks so great. Oh, it looks so terrible. I don't think I want this, but it's here and I love it. By the end of the Harry Potter books, I was just like, no, like you're frustrating me and all these people are engaging me and I still respect you and I thank you for these books. But the conversation that I sprung up around it was so much richer than the actual text at that point. Okay. I think that we probably need to get on to Amanda, but I feel like I, we could talk about this for like 18,000 hours. We completely could. Thank you so much. Also, it was a wonderful, wonderful question. We really appreciate it. And the recording too, very, like very well intoned. And I didn't have to like make guesses at your intonation because you actually sent it. So if people have questions, comments, just topics they want to talk about, please send in more recordings. We love you for doing that. Thank you. All right. So let's welcome Amanda Brennan. Hello. Hi, Amanda. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? I'm excellent. I am so glad you could join us. Finally. I know our schedules are so crazy. It's true. It's true. So Amanda is the meme librarian. That is true. That's like your branding, like always, right? That's not just the name of your job. That's the name of your job, is it? No, it's not the name of my job. That's too bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. When I got my first job, I was like, hmm, I need a personal brand. What should it be? And in librarianship, there's like sketch librarian and the wine librarian and inked librarian. So it's this kind of meme with inside librarianship. Can you go back and just tell me all those librarian memes again? Wait, is that like a tattooed librarian? Yeah, she's really into tattoos. And the wine librarian? She's really into wine. She's not a librarian of wine, though. Oh, see, I thought I was thinking because you're kind of a librarian of memes.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.38, "text": " are bringing you Fansplaining.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [366, 5062,

Fansplaining. Welcome to the, oh, six? Number six? Six. It's the episode of Fansplaining, the podcast by, for, and about fandom. This podcast is, this particular one is titled The Meme Librarian, and we are going to have the eponymous Amanda Brennan as our guest, and she's the last member of our San Diego Comic-Con panel for us to interview. And after that, I don't even know who we're going to talk to. We don't, this was the only five people we know. Of course, we're going to talk to some wonderful people. Our next guest is going to be Ebony Elizabeth Thomas, and we're really excited about that. All right, we know one other person. Amanda. But actually, even before we get to Amanda, we had our first reader audio comment, listener audio comment. They're not readers. We're just literally rubbing our hands together in joy right now, or possibly evilness. I don't know what that is. Joy. It's joy. Okay, joy. Joy. Cool. Yeah, I really like it. Okay, so let's play the comment for our lovely listeners, and then talk about it. Okay. Hey, I'm Elsa, Buffer Overon on Tumblr. I've really been enjoying your podcast, but there's a couple things that I keep chewing on that I wanted to talk about. At one point in the first episode, Flourish seems to be saying that there's a straight line between corporations seeing fandom works as earned media, i.e., a source of market research and free advertising, and the end of the Harry Potter era cease and desist letters. And I guess more broadly, the end of the massive copyright overreach of the 90s and 2000s. And on one hand, the free advertising idea has been around for a while, particularly in terms of peer-to-peer, social network-based sharing of media. And it seems to have gotten a lot more traction than the non-commercial fair use argument. It probably is true that the flourishing of fandom spaces has had much more to do with corporate self-interest than any legal victories by the OTW. But I don't think that's something to be celebrated. It actually feels very precarious. And then in episode two, Meredith Levine was talking about the production cycle of media, and basically that consumerism, like fans buying stuff, is how we get canon, which we need in order to get fan works. And maybe I'm being utopian here, but it feels like fanfic is an ecosystem that's really not that dependent on the canon. I mean, to write good fanfic, the author needs to be really engaged with the original canon. And if you love a show or a book or a song, I think you have to pay for it and probably also buy copies for all your friends, because that's how the people who are making commercial media get paid. But as a reader, I don't need to love or even necessarily to watch like Supernatural or Teen Wolf or any of the Marvel movies to appreciate the fic. Particularly when you're talking about a lot of the common AUs and tropes, all you need are a few good gifs of cute boys looking longly at each other, and that's enough to launch a thousand ships. But I feel like what Meredith is saying is that if we don't participate in advertising or making ourselves available for data mining for mega media companies, then they'll shut off the tap of the angsty homoerotic bromances, and then the well of fanfic will run dry, which I don't think is true. Thanks. Oh my god, such a great comment. I was so happy with this. Okay, so there's two parts to the comment. Let's go in order. The first one was calling me out. I kind of felt like all of it was calling you out. What? Yeah, she clearly hates you and thinks I'm great, even though she doesn't acknowledge that we have the same perspective. We should run a poll. Which of your two lovely co-hosts do you like better? No, but actually, I thought that she was making a good point. I also actually agree with her. It's very precarious that fan works pretty much are not legally challenged just because corporations see them as beneficial. I think she's right. It's precarious. It's precarious and it sucks. The positive symbiosis between fans and media corporations right now is kind of predicated on the fact that, I don't know, everyone's playing nice. Say that Snowy Ice Dragon or whatever, Snow Queen's Ice Dragon, I believe, E.L. James had written Fifty Shades of Grey, and Stephanie Meyer was deeply offended by BDSM. That would have been such a different story if that had sued her. Right. Talk about them challenging and also being allowed to be unconventional or taboo or whatever. That hasn't actually come up against these media corporations. So everyone's just playing kind of nice and vanilla with them. Not in a big way. You said not in a big way? Yeah, it hasn't come up in a big way. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I think that we are maybe headed in that direction, but in order for that to happen, I think, among other things, we would need to see a literary elite take fan works more seriously. In order to publish the more challenging fan works. Right now, the things that are getting published in fan works are like Sexy BDSM Sexy Time and My Date with One Direction, which, let me tell you, I love My Date with One Direction. I would go on a date with all of One Direction, preferably at once. But no one's going to publish the more challenging stuff that really does sort of go against norms until you see people taking it seriously as literature and publishing. But I don't even think it has to be that. All right, so we had Wattpad talking about contests. What movie studios want to have with their fan fiction? What happens when people start writing stories that really offend them? I mean, I feel like we talked about this a lot. But they already do that. For their contests? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess because there's no power there. That's it. The person submitting it is a mick and munt, right? And that's why I'm saying that the day that somebody writes a fan fic that really, truly challenges... I mean, this is the When Done Gone issue. The reason the When Done Gone was a big deal was that the When Done Gone was a literary work that had a powerful publisher behind it. Literary estate of Gone with the Wind. And when we see a fan fic, you know, on the front page of The Atlantic, in a discussion of like... When does The Atlantic publish fiction on the front page? No, I mean, a discussion about it. The way that Kenny Goldsmith's poetry is getting debated in the pages of The Atlantic. When we see that happening, when we see that conversation happening, then that's when we're going to have a fight. There has to be some kind of like cultural power behind fan fic that's more than just people on the internet. That's giving too much. Too much credit to the publishing industry and literary establishment. I think that this could happen just as easily with movies and television. I don't think this has to have anything to do with books. Maybe. I don't know. But I'm not actually sure that we're like building up to the first ever... Because like I said, the When Done Gone is a great example of something like this happening. Sure, but that's not a part of modern networked media fandom either. It's not, but it's not. That's true. Score. Anyway, I think the something is we agree that this is a precarious position. I'm naturally more inclined to be a pragmatist than anything. You're a capitalist because you love money. I do love money. God, I love it so much. I'm more inclined to be a pragmatist than some people, perhaps than Elizabeth. I thought you were about to subtweet me and then you just said my name out loud. I don't need to subtweet you. So that's my response to that. To that part of it. To that part of it, because then there was the other part, is about what Meredith was saying. I was really pleased that Elsa brought this up because, and I think I mentioned this and I don't think Meredith would mind me saying this because I think she knows we come from very... Actually, I said that Meredith on Twitter the other day. I think you and I come from the exact opposite ends of the spectrum and we can both learn by meaning somewhere in the middle. I think that's an adult way to describe that. But when I was editing the Meredith episode, the whole time I was like, why didn't I say anything? I disagree with everything you're saying. I remember at one point, we were pushing back on something and she was like, well, you guys come from fan fiction and that's a big, big, but it's not everything. And she was kind of saying because we were coming from the fan fiction perspective, we didn't have a full sense of the kind of perspective that she was coming from. Well, I do think that she comes from very much more the video end of things. So I don't think that I share the same perspective as she does. It's true that one part that we did cut out was the part where she talked about her history with Harry Potter and it was so completely different from mine or yours. The way that she interacted with those books. I encountered this too when I went to, say, GeekyCon. The way that a lot of people there were engaging with the books was very different than people who were in transformative fandom. It's not better or worse. It's just different. The big question that came up with that was she seemed to be saying, Meredith seemed to be saying, we as fans needed to continue to give our money to mega media conglomerates in order to receive back the stuff we're fans of. And I thought that Elsa's point was really nuanced saying that there's a difference between writers and readers and how much they're reliant on canon. From my perspective, I don't know that I would say we have to give money to big mega media corporations in order to get canon because I think that there's a lot of things that are smaller that can produce canon. For instance, the Lizzie Bennet diaries. I mean, that was not a mega multi-million dollar media conglomerate. It's not the Avengers franchise. But I do think that there have to be source texts that a lot of people are familiar with. In order for fandom to foment, right? Because in order for readers to be showing up there, you may never have watched Supernatural, but you know what it is. And that's why you know to look for fan fiction about it. So you agree, we both agree with Elsa on this point, right? I feel like there's so many people who join fandoms kind of with a distant connection to the source material because you get so invested in the fandom, right? I agree with her on that point. I just think that there has to be like a critical mass in order for there to be a fandom. Yeah, but I definitely, not me personally, but I've definitely encountered a lot of people who will read a good story in any fandom and they don't care about the source material. All I'm saying is that I think that for writers, there needs to be a community around the source material that's large enough for them to keep engaging. I don't think it has to be incredibly large. It doesn't have to be the size of Supernatural or Sherlock or One Direction. No, not at all. But there does have to be some amount of foment. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a mega media conglomerate, but I do think that there has to be some amount of, it can't just be entirely one-to-one because then it's no longer fan fiction. I just started, you know, it's interesting. So I just started rereading one of my favorite Torchwood fan fiction authors. I follow her on Tumblr, but she rarely posts. And two days ago, she posted a new story. She barely written anything in the last few years because that show ended and a lot of people left. And that has nothing to do with the production cycle. That show is done. Even though they didn't officially end it, it's over. I think that consumerist fandom, it's obviously huge. And like I went to Comic-Con and I was like, oh, here it is. But it's like, it appeals to me as someone to study it, but not to participate in it. I see both sides. I see Elsa's point. But I also feel like, again, like you cannot make an Avengers movie without a huge budget. And in order for that huge budget to be justified, you have to have a lot of people buying into it, paying for it. It's giving their money to mega conglomerates. Save our show campaigns means like going out and buying what, what, what show is it? Was it Chuck that went to Subway and bought like Chuck, Chuck, Chuck fandom, Chuck, they did save our show campaign. And they like went and bought Subway sandwiches because Subway was the major advertiser and they got another season of the show, right? Like it's, it's completely, I think that's what Meriden's talking about. I don't want another season of the show. I don't want another season of Torchwood. I'm going to fuck it up again. Incredible fan works. By the time this is like, this is like my feelings about the X-Files where I'm like on this constant roller coaster. Oh, it looks so great. Oh, it looks so terrible. I don't think I want this, but it's here and I love it. By the end of the Harry Potter books, I was just like, no, like you're frustrating me and all these people are engaging me and I still respect you and I thank you for these books. But the conversation that I sprung up around it was so much richer than the actual text at that point. Okay. I think that we probably need to get on to Amanda, but I feel like I, we could talk about this for like 18,000 hours. We completely could. Thank you so much. Also, it was a wonderful, wonderful question. We really appreciate it. And the recording too, very, like very well intoned. And I didn't have to like make guesses at your intonation because you actually sent it. So if people have questions, comments, just topics they want to talk about, please send in more recordings. We love you for doing that. Thank you. All right. So let's welcome Amanda Brennan. Hello. Hi, Amanda. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? I'm excellent. I am so glad you could join us. Finally. I know our schedules are so crazy. It's true. It's true. So Amanda is the meme librarian. That is true. That's like your branding, like always, right? That's not just the name of your job. That's the name of your job, is it? No, it's not the name of my job. That's too bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. When I got my first job, I was like, hmm, I need a personal brand. What should it be? And in librarianship, there's like sketch librarian and the wine librarian and inked librarian. So it's this kind of meme with inside librarianship. Can you go back and just tell me all those librarian memes again? Wait, is that like a tattooed librarian? Yeah, she's really into tattoos. And the wine librarian? She's really into wine. She's not a librarian of wine, though. Oh, see, I thought I was thinking because you're kind of a librarian of memes.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.86, "text": " are bringing you Fansplaining. Welcome to the, oh, six?
