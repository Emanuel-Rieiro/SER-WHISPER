{"text": " Let me just allow my guests to settle down while I remind us all of our commitments for the year 2016. And just by way of confirmation, we've committed ourselves to three things this year. First, to improve ourselves as individuals, that is our faith, our character, our relationships. Our second commitment is to improve our value, the value proposition that undergets our persons. And in five areas, our brand positioning, our ability to leverage, our income streams, our network, and our knowledge base. The third area of improvement is very important and has some relationship with today's discussion. Our strategy or our approach as individuals, we are committing ourselves to get it right the first time, execute faster, execute cheaper, and execute hassle-free, and execute more efficiently. So anytime you think about your 2016, remind yourself that you want to improve yourself, improve your value, and improve your strategy.

Fifteen minutes past the hour of seven right here on Springboard, your virtual university. The subject for today and for the next five weeks, my ideal Ghana. What do you want to see in your nation? If you had a chance to design the nation based on your own prescriptions, what you desire, what you want to see, what will feature on the canvas? I have two guests to help me get this show underway. And let me start with, maybe let me start with Isi. Give us your first five prescriptions for your ideal Ghana. Headline form that we'll see if you can begin to unpack the details. So, all your first five. A public leadership training institute for all public leaders. Nobody can get into public office without going through that training. Please lay down. Please lay down. All right. That's very serious. Say it again. A public leadership training institute for all public leaders where nobody can get into public office without going through that training. Right. And then I'd love to see Ghana as an industrial powerhouse. Not just importing, but producing, manufacturing, et cetera. So, industry. And then there's education and literacy. One key, in fact, two keywords for me here are choice and career planning. So, education and literacy. Yes. So, this is, you know, focus, a serious focus on education and literacy. Right. Right. So, choice. So, the choice is part of the education. Yes. Right. So, choice where, you know, people can actually make choices along the way. And then a clean, green environment with lots of options for indoor and outdoor recreation. I think it's critical. Right. And then a rationalized road network with rail and road grid across the country. North, south, east, west, you know, cutting across in all directions. Rail network. Rail network. Right. First five prescriptions, public leadership training institute and a mandatory requirement for everyone seeking to be in public office. The second one, you want us to be an industrial powerhouse. Not just importing, but producing. To have a focus on education and literacy. And you mentioned two words, choice and? Career. Choice and career. Explain those two. Well, when you look at our current system, students really have no choice. You go and study this, go and study that. There's no exposure to different career options. And then we assign what people should be studying. And I think it stifles us a lot. People talk about STEM, for example, forgetting that the arts, literature, all those things are important. And for me, a creative people can solve problems. You know, so it's important to begin introducing choice and career exposure right from primary school all the way up. And getting into a system where people are studying things that they want to study, they are interested in. I assume people are studying what they want to study? No. It's only when their grades don't meet the course that they want that they don't get into it. Is that okay? No. You know, growing up, I don't know about the two. I think it's the same for the two of you where if you were smart in quotes, you studied the sciences. And if you were not as good enough, yes, then you were pushed towards the arts. So you may have somebody who's studying science, studying to be a medical doctor. Who hates it? But would rather be doing history or geography, et cetera. And so that element of choice and career exposure, I think, would do us a whole lot of good. Right. And then a clean, green environment. Indoor and outdoor. Yes. Right. Green indoors sounds quite interesting. And then the first thing. But with recreational options, indoors and outdoors. All right. All right. Then extensive road network in all four directions, north, south, east, and west. Road and rail. Road and rail. Okay. Road and rail. Right. Good. I'm sure the other five will come to that. Ace, let me start with your first five prescriptions. Okay. It's not really in any order. Right. ACS, Brilliant 5, is going to make me sound pedestrian. No. Well, my number one is the new Ghanaian. You can guess where I'm going. It's the one who's moved from being a conformist to a transforming person. I almost said transformer, but that sounds very ECG. So the one who's moved from conforming to transforming. That's my first one. Two, my deal Ghana will from tomorrow start 30 years of free education right across the board. Free public education. It's a 30-year project. Why 30 years? By 30, the baby who is born tomorrow will be 30 and will have a job. And by that time, the society will be so established through education that he or she can pay for his kids to go to school. If you say for the next 30 years, are you saying that from 2016 to 2046, or are you saying that for the first 30 years where persons might not understand 30 years? That the baby who is born tomorrow will be 30 years tomorrow. Right. 30 years time. Right. By that time, we would have produced a new crop who can afford to pay for their children to go to any school they want to go to. So we gradually introduced fee pay. What informed this particular prescription? This. Do you want us to get into the details now? Look, I've seen, I think there's one country that tried it and it transformed the country. And I believe that, look, an educated citizenry is absolutely essential. People say that, oh, come to Ghana because there's cheap labor. Yes, it's cheap in price, but it's also cheap in quality. But if we can boost the quality of our labor force through education, there'll be a massive realization of even personal. Look, the person who's been to school, presumably, will clean his gutters. So he's not infected by malaria. The person who's been to school and understands the workings of the system will demand more from government. Right. And if we don't move to the next level where our minds are open, because it has to be a mind revolution. If we don't get that mind revolution, we will remain where we are, being fed with mediocrity and saying, thank you. Do we want it? Well. What are you describing? Ideal. Number three. Number three. Small government. Now, by that, I'm not saying reduce the number of ministers. I believe that a behemoth government like we have. I know somebody in Kentucky who will be smiling at this. Actually, he's at JFK right now on his way to Accra. I know. Now, look, a huge government is a beast. It has to be staffed. It has to be shrunk to size. I think that we need to reduce things like the powers of government to appoint everybody in the public and civil service. I believe that we should shrink the public service. We should shrink the civil service into a small size. I'll bet on my way here, I heard that yesterday, the Swiss have voted not to accept a salary of $2,500 a month for doing no work. The proposal was that every Swiss should be paid $2,500 a month just for being Swiss. And guess what? 75% of the people voted against it. Why? We don't want this. We don't want the freebie. The country may be rich, but we don't want the freebie. Let's ask the question. Do you know the name of the chancellor or president or prime minister of Switzerland? No. You don't care. I don't know. You don't see him on TV commissioning projects or here. But the system works like they are watches, like clockwork, right? There's something to learn. Governance is not, I don't believe it's geographically. Look, governance is governance. Human beings are human beings. Can we learn? But I believe that we need to shrink government. Government is too big. It is competing in business, competing in finance. It is borrowing. Lending. Lending. Government should be governance. And I believe that we need to shrink the size of government. But I'll talk about another aspect of it later. Let me just hit on this government issue. Is it about the level of influence or the size per se? Both ways. You see, it is so huge that it sucks out energy. It occupies too much space and doesn't leave enough room for private growth, right? Why am I paying 26% interest, 32% interest to the banks? It is because the government is borrowing at 26%. Right. Why is the government borrowing? To feed that beast called government. It is too huge. There are too many hangers-on. I believe we can shrink the size. A lot of the things that governments do can go to the private sector. It is 25 minutes past the hour of 7 o'clock. And I'm just on 8 out of 20. And this is just by way of introduction. Let me come to ACES. Fourth and fifth prescription. This deals with parliament. I believe that we need to merge, bring in a system of proportional representation. Now, if you look at the proposals for the 1992 constitution, the people who did the proposals suggested a half and half situation where half parliamentarians are elected directly, first past the post, and the other half are brought in through proportional representation. Looking at the amount of votes you won across the country, the parties will be asked this time to bring people in more like technocrats to assist who will be MPs, not through the direct voting, but through a technocratic system. And it can help things like tribal balance. So, for instance, a party that doesn't win any votes, let's say, in my village, can actually bring somebody from my village to parliament who is a technocrat and can assist parliament. Now, we jettisoned that and said we have no history of proportional representation. I'm beginning to believe that we need a system where half are voted and half come in through proportional representation. And we shouldn't go with more than 100. 50 voted, 50 proportional representation. I know somebody else who would smile at the idea of 100 parliamentarians. The person would just be so, so happy to hear this. 50 constituencies voted, 50 by proportional representation. Give me your number five. Number five? You like trouble. Reduce the number of public holidays. I agree. I believe that some days can be observed without staying at home. Do you know it's an offense to go to work on a public holiday? Right. Why should I go to jail because I want to work for this country? It doesn't make sense. There are four holidays that I believe, there are five holidays that I believe we can, some we can merge and some we can scrap. Simply observe them. We don't have to stay at home like AU Day. Only seven countries in Africa celebrate AU Day and they are all broke countries. Including Ghana. Okay, I hope it's for you. Right. Right. All right. So I'm going to ask you at the end of this series, which of the ten you are most passionate about. But one thing that is giving me so much joy is that we've had five from each side and yet there is still no intersection, direct intersection. It might have been the second half of the match. Problems are many. But it just tells me that, it just tells me that, give it a chance, each of us will, and I could see you nodding your head when Isi was speaking and I could see her nodding her head when you were speaking. I nod when I'm really speaking. I could have thought of what she thought about. It's like, wow. All right. Nice versa. All right. We're almost halfway through this program. And let me just remind you if you just joined us, it's a very important discussion we are having about the ideal Ghana. And, my, my, it's my pleasure to announce the first five of Dr. Isi's answer as public leadership training institute and a mandatory, it be mandatory for everyone seeking public office to attend that institute. The second one, Ghana being an industrial powerhouse, not just important, but producing. The third one, a revising of our approach to education and literacy. Maybe that's the one that you had some intersection in. And she talked about choice and, and career development. The fourth one is a clean, green environment, both with options for recreation, both indoor and outdoor. The fifth is an extensive road and rail network in all four directions, north, south, east, and west. Isi's gotten the new Ghanaian, a movement from being a conformist to a transformist. The second one being a 30-year program of free public education starting tomorrow, the 6th of June. Or is it the 5th? Is it the 6th or 6th of June? The third one is small government and, and small government in both ways, in terms of the size and the influence. And he described the huge government as a beast which must be reduced to size or tigged. The fourth is proportional representation in parliament, something that somehow, any time you mention, the parties in majority resist, the parties in minority understand. We don't take that understanding when we cross over. It's a subject for further discussion. The fifth one is to reduce the number of public holidays. And he has singled out one that is evidently, in his opinion, not necessary. It is 30 minutes past the hour of 7. At the halfway point, let me ask you, what, what is important to you as a person? Let me scan through some of the early comments that came on Facebook. And when I come back, I'm going to ask Ace to, choose from the ones that Ace shared. The one that he wants to add to his list and comment on. And then I'm going to do the same to Ace. But let me take a few comments from Facebook. On education, George Nati aligns with Ace's point. He says, a Ghana where there is 99.9% literacy rate. Mark Evans says, a Ghana where we have practical educational system hinging on science and technology. He says, affordable world-class universities. Frankie L. Alhava says, a practical and educational system, technical educational system instead of the theoretical one that we have. On corruption, Erasmus Decker says, zero tolerance of corruption will be my priority. It's a view shared by Christabel Stildazi. Dennis Ochoa-Bracu says, my ideal Ghana must be free of institutional corruption and bureaucracies. Issue of functional systems and structures. Gifty, Oseb Wachigingli says, a Ghana where the rule of law works with strong institutions and processes for ensuring quality standards and accountability to the citizenry. Patrick Bedu says, modern water transport within the city and through Akosombo to the small towns in the north. So, ACTU, your rail and road network. He adds, an inland water system. Janet Winton writing from the U.S. says, faith in God, for with God all things are possible. And when I come back, I'm going to talk about the views on leadership and good governance from the listeners who have contributed so far on social media. So, Ace, let me give you a chance to comment on the first five that EC has given us. Which one you want to steal and add to your list and you have a few thoughts on. All of them. You know, the need for people who seek public office to get some little training in public affairs is absolutely important. Because sometimes we literally rip people out of school after national service to become a minister or deputy minister. The person is absolutely clueless on the dynamics of life. And if such a person were to go to a two, three month boot camp, teaching you even how to speak in public. So you don't stand there and say, where is my speech?", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 6.18, "text": " Let me just allow my guests to settle down while I remind us all of our commitments for the

commitments for the year 2016. And just by way of confirmation, we've committed ourselves to three things this year. First, to improve ourselves as individuals, that is our faith, our character, our relationships. Our second commitment is to improve our value, the value proposition that undergets our persons. And in five areas, our brand positioning, our ability to leverage, our income streams, our network, and our knowledge base. The third area of improvement is very important and has some relationship with today's discussion. Our strategy or our approach as individuals, we are committing ourselves to get it right the first time, execute faster, execute cheaper, and execute hassle-free, and execute more efficiently. So anytime you think about your 2016, remind yourself that you want to improve yourself, improve your value, and improve your strategy.

Fifteen minutes past the hour of seven right here on Springboard, your virtual university. The subject for today and for the next five weeks, my ideal Ghana. What do you want to see in your nation? If you had a chance to design the nation based on your own prescriptions, what you desire, what you want to see, what will feature on the canvas? I have two guests to help me get this show underway. And let me start with, maybe let me start with Isi. Give us your first five prescriptions for your ideal Ghana. Headline form that we'll see if you can begin to unpack the details. So, all your first five. A public leadership training institute for all public leaders. Nobody can get into public office without going through that training. Please lay down. Please lay down. All right. That's very serious. Say it again. A public leadership training institute for all public leaders where nobody can get into public office without going through that training. Right. And then I'd love to see Ghana as an industrial powerhouse. Not just importing, but producing, manufacturing, et cetera. So, industry. And then there's education and literacy. One key, in fact, two keywords for me here are choice and career planning. So, education and literacy. Yes. So, this is, you know, focus, a serious focus on education and literacy. Right. Right. So, choice. So, the choice is part of the education. Yes. Right. So, choice where, you know, people can actually make choices along the way. And then a clean, green environment with lots of options for indoor and outdoor recreation. I think it's critical. Right. And then a rationalized road network with rail and road grid across the country. North, south, east, west, you know, cutting across in all directions. Rail network. Rail network. Right. First five prescriptions, public leadership training institute and a mandatory requirement for everyone seeking to be in public office. The second one, you want us to be an industrial powerhouse. Not just importing, but producing. To have a focus on education and literacy. And you mentioned two words, choice and? Career. Choice and career. Explain those two. Well, when you look at our current system, students really have no choice. You go and study this, go and study that. There's no exposure to different career options. And then we assign what people should be studying. And I think it stifles us a lot. People talk about STEM, for example, forgetting that the arts, literature, all those things are important. And for me, a creative people can solve problems. You know, so it's important to begin introducing choice and career exposure right from primary school all the way up. And getting into a system where people are studying things that they want to study, they are interested in. I assume people are studying what they want to study? No. It's only when their grades don't meet the course that they want that they don't get into it. Is that okay? No. You know, growing up, I don't know about the two. I think it's the same for the two of you where if you were smart in quotes, you studied the sciences. And if you were not as good enough, yes, then you were pushed towards the arts. So you may have somebody who's studying science, studying to be a medical doctor. Who hates it? But would rather be doing history or geography, et cetera. And so that element of choice and career exposure, I think, would do us a whole lot of good. Right. And then a clean, green environment. Indoor and outdoor. Yes. Right. Green indoors sounds quite interesting. And then the first thing. But with recreational options, indoors and outdoors. All right. All right. Then extensive road network in all four directions, north, south, east, and west. Road and rail. Road and rail. Okay. Road and rail. Right. Good. I'm sure the other five will come to that. Ace, let me start with your first five prescriptions. Okay. It's not really in any order. Right. ACS, Brilliant 5, is going to make me sound pedestrian. No. Well, my number one is the new Ghanaian. You can guess where I'm going. It's the one who's moved from being a conformist to a transforming person. I almost said transformer, but that sounds very ECG. So the one who's moved from conforming to transforming. That's my first one. Two, my deal Ghana will from tomorrow start 30 years of free education right across the board. Free public education. It's a 30-year project. Why 30 years? By 30, the baby who is born tomorrow will be 30 and will have a job. And by that time, the society will be so established through education that he or she can pay for his kids to go to school. If you say for the next 30 years, are you saying that from 2016 to 2046, or are you saying that for the first 30 years where persons might not understand 30 years? That the baby who is born tomorrow will be 30 years tomorrow. Right. 30 years time. Right. By that time, we would have produced a new crop who can afford to pay for their children to go to any school they want to go to. So we gradually introduced fee pay. What informed this particular prescription? This. Do you want us to get into the details now? Look, I've seen, I think there's one country that tried it and it transformed the country. And I believe that, look, an educated citizenry is absolutely essential. People say that, oh, come to Ghana because there's cheap labor. Yes, it's cheap in price, but it's also cheap in quality. But if we can boost the quality of our labor force through education, there'll be a massive realization of even personal. Look, the person who's been to school, presumably, will clean his gutters. So he's not infected by malaria. The person who's been to school and understands the workings of the system will demand more from government. Right. And if we don't move to the next level where our minds are open, because it has to be a mind revolution. If we don't get that mind revolution, we will remain where we are, being fed with mediocrity and saying, thank you. Do we want it? Well. What are you describing? Ideal. Number three. Number three. Small government. Now, by that, I'm not saying reduce the number of ministers. I believe that a behemoth government like we have. I know somebody in Kentucky who will be smiling at this. Actually, he's at JFK right now on his way to Accra. I know. Now, look, a huge government is a beast. It has to be staffed. It has to be shrunk to size. I think that we need to reduce things like the powers of government to appoint everybody in the public and civil service. I believe that we should shrink the public service. We should shrink the civil service into a small size. I'll bet on my way here, I heard that yesterday, the Swiss have voted not to accept a salary of $2,500 a month for doing no work. The proposal was that every Swiss should be paid $2,500 a month just for being Swiss. And guess what? 75% of the people voted against it. Why? We don't want this. We don't want the freebie. The country may be rich, but we don't want the freebie. Let's ask the question. Do you know the name of the chancellor or president or prime minister of Switzerland? No. You don't care. I don't know. You don't see him on TV commissioning projects or here. But the system works like they are watches, like clockwork, right? There's something to learn. Governance is not, I don't believe it's geographically. Look, governance is governance. Human beings are human beings. Can we learn? But I believe that we need to shrink government. Government is too big. It is competing in business, competing in finance. It is borrowing. Lending. Lending. Government should be governance. And I believe that we need to shrink the size of government. But I'll talk about another aspect of it later. Let me just hit on this government issue. Is it about the level of influence or the size per se? Both ways. You see, it is so huge that it sucks out energy. It occupies too much space and doesn't leave enough room for private growth, right? Why am I paying 26% interest, 32% interest to the banks? It is because the government is borrowing at 26%. Right. Why is the government borrowing? To feed that beast called government. It is too huge. There are too many hangers-on. I believe we can shrink the size. A lot of the things that governments do can go to the private sector. It is 25 minutes past the hour of 7 o'clock. And I'm just on 8 out of 20. And this is just by way of introduction. Let me come to ACES. Fourth and fifth prescription. This deals with parliament. I believe that we need to merge, bring in a system of proportional representation. Now, if you look at the proposals for the 1992 constitution, the people who did the proposals suggested a half and half situation where half parliamentarians are elected directly, first past the post, and the other half are brought in through proportional representation. Looking at the amount of votes you won across the country, the parties will be asked this time to bring people in more like technocrats to assist who will be MPs, not through the direct voting, but through a technocratic system. And it can help things like tribal balance. So, for instance, a party that doesn't win any votes, let's say, in my village, can actually bring somebody from my village to parliament who is a technocrat and can assist parliament. Now, we jettisoned that and said we have no history of proportional representation. I'm beginning to believe that we need a system where half are voted and half come in through proportional representation. And we shouldn't go with more than 100. 50 voted, 50 proportional representation. I know somebody else who would smile at the idea of 100 parliamentarians. The person would just be so, so happy to hear this. 50 constituencies voted, 50 by proportional representation. Give me your number five. Number five? You like trouble. Reduce the number of public holidays. I agree. I believe that some days can be observed without staying at home. Do you know it's an offense to go to work on a public holiday? Right. Why should I go to jail because I want to work for this country? It doesn't make sense. There are four holidays that I believe, there are five holidays that I believe we can, some we can merge and some we can scrap. Simply observe them. We don't have to stay at home like AU Day. Only seven countries in Africa celebrate AU Day and they are all broke countries. Including Ghana. Okay, I hope it's for you. Right. Right. All right. So I'm going to ask you at the end of this series, which of the ten you are most passionate about. But one thing that is giving me so much joy is that we've had five from each side and yet there is still no intersection, direct intersection. It might have been the second half of the match. Problems are many. But it just tells me that, it just tells me that, give it a chance, each of us will, and I could see you nodding your head when Isi was speaking and I could see her nodding her head when you were speaking. I nod when I'm really speaking. I could have thought of what she thought about. It's like, wow. All right. Nice versa. All right. We're almost halfway through this program. And let me just remind you if you just joined us, it's a very important discussion we are having about the ideal Ghana. And, my, my, it's my pleasure to announce the first five of Dr. Isi's answer as public leadership training institute and a mandatory, it be mandatory for everyone seeking public office to attend that institute. The second one, Ghana being an industrial powerhouse, not just important, but producing. The third one, a revising of our approach to education and literacy. Maybe that's the one that you had some intersection in. And she talked about choice and, and career development. The fourth one is a clean, green environment, both with options for recreation, both indoor and outdoor. The fifth is an extensive road and rail network in all four directions, north, south, east, and west. Isi's gotten the new Ghanaian, a movement from being a conformist to a transformist. The second one being a 30-year program of free public education starting tomorrow, the 6th of June. Or is it the 5th? Is it the 6th or 6th of June? The third one is small government and, and small government in both ways, in terms of the size and the influence. And he described the huge government as a beast which must be reduced to size or tigged. The fourth is proportional representation in parliament, something that somehow, any time you mention, the parties in majority resist, the parties in minority understand. We don't take that understanding when we cross over. It's a subject for further discussion. The fifth one is to reduce the number of public holidays. And he has singled out one that is evidently, in his opinion, not necessary. It is 30 minutes past the hour of 7. At the halfway point, let me ask you, what, what is important to you as a person? Let me scan through some of the early comments that came on Facebook. And when I come back, I'm going to ask Ace to, choose from the ones that Ace shared. The one that he wants to add to his list and comment on. And then I'm going to do the same to Ace. But let me take a few comments from Facebook. On education, George Nati aligns with Ace's point. He says, a Ghana where there is 99.9% literacy rate. Mark Evans says, a Ghana where we have practical educational system hinging on science and technology. He says, affordable world-class universities. Frankie L. Alhava says, a practical and educational system, technical educational system instead of the theoretical one that we have. On corruption, Erasmus Decker says, zero tolerance of corruption will be my priority. It's a view shared by Christabel Stildazi. Dennis Ochoa-Bracu says, my ideal Ghana must be free of institutional corruption and bureaucracies. Issue of functional systems and structures. Gifty, Oseb Wachigingli says, a Ghana where the rule of law works with strong institutions and processes for ensuring quality standards and accountability to the citizenry. Patrick Bedu says, modern water transport within the city and through Akosombo to the small towns in the north. So, ACTU, your rail and road network. He adds, an inland water system. Janet Winton writing from the U.S. says, faith in God, for with God all things are possible. And when I come back, I'm going to talk about the views on leadership and good governance from the listeners who have contributed so far on social media. So, Ace, let me give you a chance to comment on the first five that EC has given us. Which one you want to steal and add to your list and you have a few thoughts on. All of them. You know, the need for people who seek public office to get some little training in public affairs is absolutely important. Because sometimes we literally rip people out of school after national service to become a minister or deputy minister. The person is absolutely clueless on the dynamics of life. And if such a person were to go to a two, three month boot camp, teaching you even how to speak in public.
