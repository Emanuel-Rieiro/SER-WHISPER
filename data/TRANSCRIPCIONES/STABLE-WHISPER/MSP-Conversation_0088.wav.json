{"text": " drinking more because DC United is so, so bad. So bad, guys. We're the worst. We are. Actually, on Steve Davis's power rankings this week, we are not the worst because we are not, in I think Jeremiah Ocean's words, a flaming dumpster fire the way Chivas USA are. But we're pretty damn close right now, guys. We are. On the field, we may be the worst MLS team. Dot, dot, dot. And history. So we've got that going. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So last weekend, lost two to nothing at Chicago. Early own goal off of Perry Kitchen and Nick DeLeon, putting one past Joe Willis. And then a late breakaway as we try to push for an equalizer. Mike McGee gets behind the defense for the second time in about 20 seconds. And this time he puts it away. So do you guys have anything you actually want to talk about from that game? Or should we just move on to the more general suckitude? I do want to point out that I thought, and obviously we're talking about progress in relative terms, because for us, progress just means not, you know, our 11 players shooting on our own goal. Yeah. I thought Dwayne DeRosario, he didn't have a good opening 20 minutes. It looked like more of the same from him. But I think after the first 20 minutes, he started to drop off the front line, looked a little active. He looked like he had some ideas. He was trying, a lot of times he was looking to the fullbacks and giving them passes that made them run into the attack rather than slow down again. So he was trying to get some other guys more engaged in the attack and get some options going, which is one of the things he used to do very well. He hasn't really done this season. So that, you know, that little bit of nugget was a piece of progress. But then he got taken out, which I didn't really agree with, unless he had some sort of injury that the team just isn't making public. I'm guessing Ben Olsen decided before the game that DeRosario wasn't going to play more than an hour in Chicago because he played 120 minutes in Richmond on Tuesday. So that's, I mean, that's just taking care of your guy. I was surprised that he started at all, honestly. I really didn't expect him to because he's on the wrong side of 33 and he's going to break down if you keep doing that. He's had recent injury problems. So as far as that game, tactically, it might've been the best decision, better decision to leave him in, but for his own health, for the team, because who knows if we need him to score goals right now or to win games because it's not working with him or without him, but he is still one of the better players on the team and you got to protect him. Yeah. But I mean, the only thing I would, I mean, that's all, that's all reasonable. I just think that at this point, you know, taking a risk to win a game and just hoping that nothing happens there. We need to win so badly that, you know, you have to gamble in certain spots and sometimes it's just on, is a player going to have an injury from overuse? And it's possible, but then DeRosario doesn't have as many minutes on his legs over the course of the season as a lot of the other guys because of various reasons. Mostly suspension. Yeah. Well, there's, there's, there's the head budding suspension. So, but you know, it was a situation where we needed a little bit more of what he was doing and that doesn't absolve the rest of the team from not also providing that. Certainly if someone comes off, but you're doing something that's correct, the other guys on the team can't just say, well, the one guy that was doing it is gone. So now we just carry on not doing that. Someone needed to step into that void and provide that sort of, uh, that sort of play prompting other players to do a little more and no one really delivered that. Yeah. And that's the story of the year, isn't it? Nobody's stepping up. Chris Pontius is timid on the ball. And when he does try something, mostly it doesn't work except for, uh, his two assists this year. One of them was a header basically at midfield that went to Raphael who scored a ridiculous goal. And we one of them was his assist on Porter's goal, which, where he just took a pass from Nick Daly on and sent it in and in swinger to the back post. And Porter was there to finish it. Um, we, we have two goals this year. Yeah. I, I, I've forgotten what goals look like. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. It, it, it's something that we're not used to seeing on, on a particular end of the field right now. And it sucks. You guys, it really sucks. Speaking of the other end of the field, which I, by that, I mean, not speaking of it all. Oh, I do want to take this time to commend Connor Shunoski. I think he did a very decent job in his first start and I'd like to continue to see him out there, preferably with Ethan White rather than Daniel Woolard. Yeah. I could just see your hands in your pockets there. I really enjoyed our time with you, Connor, and I'd like to see you again. Uh, yeah, he had, he had, I'm going to pass first base tonight, but next time maybe, uh, wrong sport, buddy, wrong sport. Um, yeah, he did. He did well, you know, he was strong against Richmond. He got caught out a couple of times against Chicago, uh, chasing balls upfield or, or guys he was marking upfield that he probably shouldn't have. And he left Woolard on an Island a couple of times, but that's something you, you learn to deal with that kind of movement and, uh, how to position yourself better. First MLS start. Yeah, exactly. Um, I, I, I'd add that, you know, those, those mistakes, uh, uh, weren't as I've seen some severe center back mistakes that are much closer to our goal. If you're going to make them a stake as center back, I mean, the whole job there is to avoid making mistakes if at all possible. But if you are going to make them, it's better to make them further upfield so that the rest of the back four can at least, you know, shift into a three for a moment while you recover. Right. Or your defensive midfielder can jump back. Yeah, exactly. And those, those are the kind of mistakes where you're like, well, that's not good, but it's not catastrophic. And our other center backs, uh, have often made catastrophic mistakes. So just by that alone, uh, Shunoski, uh, ignoring the details of his performance on just broadly, uh, made progress over the other people trying to play that position. Yeah. So, um, like we said, two to nothing against Chicago, uh, about a month ago, a commenter on the side, I don't remember exactly who I should have looked it up before the show, but, um, mentioned that in 2010, and I feel okay saying 2010 now, because we are every bit as bad as we were in the year that must not be named, but can be named now, I guess. Um, and that season, every loss was like a unique snowflake of suck. And this year's the same thing. We've had games where we lost a close one. We've had games where we lost a close one. We've had own goals. We've had soft goals. We'd have goal of the week winners against us. We have had games where we looked good going forward even, and we still lost. We've had games where we've provided nothing in the attacking third, like against Chicago. Of course we lost. We've had games where our defense was good. We've had games obviously where they really, really weren't. Every single loss is different. We're not losing because of the same mistake. On the field. Every time we're losing because we're bad. And that's a, a, yeah, it's not, not a fun place to be. Bad teams will always though. Bad teams find ways to lose just like good teams find ways to win. And we routinely find a way to seek out a defeat, uh, rather than, and you know, I, other than there, I mean, there is the instance where every team that plays us essentially does the exact same thing. Same thing where they set up to defend and keep it tight in the back and wait for our idiot mistake. And then they capitalize on it. Um, other than that, every game is different. Yeah, that's about right. There are games when we dominate possession or at least control the majority of it and games where we don't see the ball at all. Of course, the game where we saw the least amount of possession, we tied zero, zero. So maybe we should just bunker for a while and just focus on keeping our defense in order because at least then we were getting draws. Maybe we should try and sneak a 12th man onto the field because they might not notice. And that would give us a much better chance at winning. But Ben, what, what 12th player would we bring on that wouldn't make things worse? Oh, that's where we are. Hello, sir. Go. So, I mean, he's I assume I just put his body on the field. I mean, guys, guys, novel strategy. What if we slide tackle the ref? Oh, I like it. Especially if it's Ricardo Salazar or, or Hilario. Yeah. I mean, I, my, my plan basically is that step one, slide tackle referee, step three, profit. Exactly. Yes. We'll be the slide tackle gnomes. It'll be great. If we had 50 gnomes on the field, in addition to the 11 players, I think we could at least, bite people's ankles. So what you're saying is we should hire Richie Williams. I mean, he did really well for us. He's out there. I mean, I'd like him to be, I'd like him to be a member of DC United's organization at some level. Yeah, there you go. So let's play a little bit of general manager. This is similar to probably do a better job than Dave Casper. Yeah. The guy knows he knows his roster rules. And he knows his salary mechanisms and loopholes and MLS, but obviously the talent evaluation and the long-term planning have not been up to snuff. I don't have anything against him. It's just right now, you know, for the second time in four seasons, we are the worst team in the league. And we have a shout at worst team in the history of the league. So let's pretend we are in his shoes. What is the first thing you would do? Would you fire Ben Olson? Would you, well, not fire yourself. We're going to take that off the table. We're going to assume you are in the position as yourself. Would you hire new scouts? What is the single first order of business you would do to get the house in order? Ben, you go first. I mean, if I was Dave Casper, a supposed expert at manipulating MLS rules, I would hire someone like a technical director, director of soccer, whatever you want to call him, who is a talent evaluator, the head scout, Kurt Morsink's boss, Ben Olson's boss, the guy who is in charge of developing the academy, scouting players. So basically you would demote yourself. What? Basically you would demote yourself. You would hire somebody to be above the general manager. Well, or promote himself to president of the club and then hire someone else to do the on the field part. And then you. So you're, you are good with the business. Right. It, which seems kind of like where the ownership has tried to go. We have a COO who focuses on business, a chief marketing officer who focuses on that aspect and a general manager who is essentially in charge of the soccer. Right. And I'm all for that. I'm completely in favor of that. But right now, the guy in charge of the soccer isn't doing a good job at providing the soccer. Right. If somehow we could have gotten Claudia Reina instead of New York City FC BBQ OMG getting Claudia Reina, that would have been a perfect situation. Claudia Reina in charge of the soccer, Dave Casper in charge of the contract contracts and magic might have happened.", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 1.92, "text": " drinking more because DC

"language": "en", "ori_dict": {"text": " drinking more because DC United is so, so bad. So bad, guys. We're the worst. We are. Actually, on Steve Davis's power rankings this week, we are not the worst because we are not, in I think Jeremiah Ocean's words, a flaming dumpster fire the way Chivas USA are. But we're pretty damn close right now, guys. We are. On the field, we may be the worst MLS team. Dot, dot, dot. And history. So we've got that going. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So last weekend, lost two to nothing at Chicago. Early own goal off of Perry Kitchen and Nick DeLeon, putting one past Joe Willis. And then a late breakaway as we try to push for an equalizer. Mike McGee gets behind the defense for the second time in about 20 seconds. And this time he puts it away. So do you guys have anything you actually want to talk about from that game? Or should we just move on to the more general suckitude? I do want to point out that I thought, and obviously we're talking about progress in relative terms, because for us, progress just means not, you know, our 11 players shooting on our own goal. Yeah. I thought Dwayne DeRosario, he didn't have a good opening 20 minutes. It looked like more of the same from him. But I think after the first 20 minutes, he started to drop off the front line, looked a little active. He looked like he had some ideas. He was trying, a lot of times he was looking to the fullbacks and giving them passes that made them run into the attack rather than slow down again. So he was trying to get some other guys more engaged in the attack and get some options going, which is one of the things he used to do very well. He hasn't really done this season. So that, you know, that little bit of nugget was a piece of progress. But then he got taken out, which I didn't really agree with, unless he had some sort of injury that the team just isn't making public. I'm guessing Ben Olsen decided before the game that DeRosario wasn't going to play more than an hour in Chicago because he played 120 minutes in Richmond on Tuesday. So that's, I mean, that's just taking care of your guy. I was surprised that he started at all, honestly. I really didn't expect him to because he's on the wrong side of 33 and he's going to break down if you keep doing that. He's had recent injury problems. So as far as that game, tactically, it might've been the best decision, better decision to leave him in, but for his own health, for the team, because who knows if we need him to score goals right now or to win games because it's not working with him or without him, but he is still one of the better players on the team and you got to protect him. Yeah. But I mean, the only thing I would, I mean, that's all, that's all reasonable. I just think that at this point, you know, taking a risk to win a game and just hoping that nothing happens there. We need to win so badly that, you know, you have to gamble in certain spots and sometimes it's just on, is a player going to have an injury from overuse? And it's possible, but then DeRosario doesn't have as many minutes on his legs over the course of the season as a lot of the other guys because of various reasons. Mostly suspension. Yeah. Well, there's, there's, there's the head budding suspension. So, but you know, it was a situation where we needed a little bit more of what he was doing and that doesn't absolve the rest of the team from not also providing that. Certainly if someone comes off, but you're doing something that's correct, the other guys on the team can't just say, well, the one guy that was doing it is gone. So now we just carry on not doing that. Someone needed to step into that void and provide that sort of, uh, that sort of play prompting other players to do a little more and no one really delivered that. Yeah. And that's the story of the year, isn't it? Nobody's stepping up. Chris Pontius is timid on the ball. And when he does try something, mostly it doesn't work except for, uh, his two assists this year. One of them was a header basically at midfield that went to Raphael who scored a ridiculous goal. And we one of them was his assist on Porter's goal, which, where he just took a pass from Nick Daly on and sent it in and in swinger to the back post. And Porter was there to finish it. Um, we, we have two goals this year. Yeah. I, I, I've forgotten what goals look like. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. It, it, it's something that we're not used to seeing on, on a particular end of the field right now. And it sucks. You guys, it really sucks. Speaking of the other end of the field, which I, by that, I mean, not speaking of it all. Oh, I do want to take this time to commend Connor Shunoski. I think he did a very decent job in his first start and I'd like to continue to see him out there, preferably with Ethan White rather than Daniel Woolard. Yeah. I could just see your hands in your pockets there. I really enjoyed our time with you, Connor, and I'd like to see you again. Uh, yeah, he had, he had, I'm going to pass first base tonight, but next time maybe, uh, wrong sport, buddy, wrong sport. Um, yeah, he did. He did well, you know, he was strong against Richmond. He got caught out a couple of times against Chicago, uh, chasing balls upfield or, or guys he was marking upfield that he probably shouldn't have. And he left Woolard on an Island a couple of times, but that's something you, you learn to deal with that kind of movement and, uh, how to position yourself better. First MLS start. Yeah, exactly. Um, I, I, I'd add that, you know, those, those mistakes, uh, uh, weren't as I've seen some severe center back mistakes that are much closer to our goal. If you're going to make them a stake as center back, I mean, the whole job there is to avoid making mistakes if at all possible. But if you are going to make them, it's better to make them further upfield so that the rest of the back four can at least, you know, shift into a three for a moment while you recover. Right. Or your defensive midfielder can jump back. Yeah, exactly. And those, those are the kind of mistakes where you're like, well, that's not good, but it's not catastrophic. And our other center backs, uh, have often made catastrophic mistakes. So just by that alone, uh, Shunoski, uh, ignoring the details of his performance on just broadly, uh, made progress over the other people trying to play that position. Yeah. So, um, like we said, two to nothing against Chicago, uh, about a month ago, a commenter on the side, I don't remember exactly who I should have looked it up before the show, but, um, mentioned that in 2010, and I feel okay saying 2010 now, because we are every bit as bad as we were in the year that must not be named, but can be named now, I guess. Um, and that season, every loss was like a unique snowflake of suck. And this year's the same thing. We've had games where we lost a close one. We've had games where we lost a close one. We've had own goals. We've had soft goals. We'd have goal of the week winners against us. We have had games where we looked good going forward even, and we still lost. We've had games where we've provided nothing in the attacking third, like against Chicago. Of course we lost. We've had games where our defense was good. We've had games obviously where they really, really weren't. Every single loss is different. We're not losing because of the same mistake. On the field. Every time we're losing because we're bad. And that's a, a, yeah, it's not, not a fun place to be. Bad teams will always though. Bad teams find ways to lose just like good teams find ways to win. And we routinely find a way to seek out a defeat, uh, rather than, and you know, I, other than there, I mean, there is the instance where every team that plays us essentially does the exact same thing. Same thing where they set up to defend and keep it tight in the back and wait for our idiot mistake. And then they capitalize on it. Um, other than that, every game is different. Yeah, that's about right. There are games when we dominate possession or at least control the majority of it and games where we don't see the ball at all. Of course, the game where we saw the least amount of possession, we tied zero, zero. So maybe we should just bunker for a while and just focus on keeping our defense in order because at least then we were getting draws. Maybe we should try and sneak a 12th man onto the field because they might not notice. And that would give us a much better chance at winning. But Ben, what, what 12th player would we bring on that wouldn't make things worse? Oh, that's where we are. Hello, sir. Go. So, I mean, he's I assume I just put his body on the field. I mean, guys, guys, novel strategy. What if we slide tackle the ref? Oh, I like it. Especially if it's Ricardo Salazar or, or Hilario. Yeah. I mean, I, my, my plan basically is that step one, slide tackle referee, step three, profit. Exactly. Yes. We'll be the slide tackle gnomes. It'll be great. If we had 50 gnomes on the field, in addition to the 11 players, I think we could at least, bite people's ankles. So what you're saying is we should hire Richie Williams. I mean, he did really well for us. He's out there. I mean, I'd like him to be, I'd like him to be a member of DC United's organization at some level. Yeah, there you go. So let's play a little bit of general manager. This is similar to probably do a better job than Dave Casper. Yeah. The guy knows he knows his roster rules. And he knows his salary mechanisms and loopholes and MLS, but obviously the talent evaluation and the long-term planning have not been up to snuff. I don't have anything against him. It's just right now, you know, for the second time in four seasons, we are the worst team in the league. And we have a shout at worst team in the history of the league. So let's pretend we are in his shoes. What is the first thing you would do? Would you fire Ben Olson? Would you, well, not fire yourself. We're going to take that off the table. We're going to assume you are in the position as yourself. Would you hire new scouts? What is the single first order of business you would do to get the house in order? Ben, you go first. I mean, if I was Dave Casper, a supposed expert at manipulating MLS rules, I would hire someone like a technical director, director of soccer, whatever you want to call him, who is a talent evaluator, the head scout, Kurt Morsink's boss, Ben Olson's boss, the guy who is in charge of developing the academy, scouting players. So basically you would demote yourself. What? Basically you would demote yourself. You would hire somebody to be above the general manager. Well, or promote himself to president of the club and then hire someone else to do the on the field part. And then you. So you're, you are good with the business. Right. It, which seems kind of like where the ownership has tried to go. We have a COO who focuses on business, a chief marketing officer who focuses on that aspect and a general manager who is essentially in charge of the soccer. Right. And I'm all for that. I'm completely in favor of that. But right now, the guy in charge of the soccer isn't doing a good job at providing the soccer. Right. If somehow we could have gotten Claudia Reina instead of New York City FC BBQ OMG getting Claudia Reina, that would have been a perfect situation. Claudia Reina in charge of the soccer, Dave Casper in charge of the contract contracts and magic might have happened.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.34, "text": " drinking more
