{"text": " we asked the band if they figured out a remedy for the lost workshop space. We record the practices, so pretty much everything that happens in the practice gets put down, and then we can listen back to it. We have to take a little bit more time, I think, writing than maybe we used to when we would try things out in a live setting. But it was actually, in the end, I think it worked to our advantage to sort of create these explosive songs that were very concise, and the fat was very trimmed off these songs. Yeah, the whole record is very tight, 33 minutes. Yeah, I mean, if you could see the room where we wrote most of it, it's a very small room, and it's very dead-sounding, kind of an airless room. And I think the sort of the muscular quality that comes through on the record was like trying to make these things sort of happen in this airless room. Could you take us there to where you wrote the record? Physically or just verbally? Sure. All right, let's go. Yeah, I think we started writing in 2012 at Corinne's house first, and then I built out the practice space in my basement. We live all quite close to each other, actually, in Portland, so we looked for practice spaces, although privacy was something that we considered because it's hard to write in a space where you know other people can hear. So some of those, like, collective practice spaces where you're just in rooms with other bands next door, it's good for rehearsal and a lot more difficult to kind of figure out parts and think. Yeah, it was down there. It's pretty traditional for us to write in a basement. We've actually been doing that since the beginning. It's not that weird. I wanted to ask each of you if there were parts, you know, parts of yourself, parts of your musical selves that you could feel coming back online when you started playing together again. Yeah, I mean, I think that the Sleater-Kinney songwriting process is really unique. It is really special. The kind of sparks that we get in our practice space are really special to this band, and I think that we feel pretty comfortable just letting it all fly in the basement, you know, which is really conducive to getting a lot of cool ideas. I mean, I think even when we were writing Price Tag, you know, I was screaming the word price tag for some, you know, during the song. A lot of those ideas come from me as a songwriter when we're all working together. The combined collaboration between the three of us really starts a lot of those ideas for me, and I really just start, you know, singing or yelling things when we're all making all that noise together, you know. And so it is, you know, I did experience that feeling of like, wow, this is, it's still there. You know, we're still doing the same kind of thing we were doing all along. I think the idea of collaboration is very alive in this band. I think because of the, there is a mutual respect there, that kind of musical mutual respect that goes beyond, like, the real world in a way, the physical world, what's happening. It goes into like a, I don't know, it's like a spiritual thing, I guess. And I feel like I trust them to you know, I want to know what they, what their ideas are for the drums and what they think. And, you know, even, you know, direct ideas. And Carrie had great drum ideas for Bury Our Friends. And, you know, like, things that really make it feel like we're working on this thing with a common goal together. We can suggest ideas of the other instruments to each other and push each other, you know, you know, sometimes we want Corin to sing louder. And we push her to do so. I just think it's, it really feels like a true collaboration, which we all, which we all love. And you can tell that we all love it. You know, by how it comes across on stage, mostly, but in the writing as well. Janet, you were the only one here who was touring and gigging nonstop, I think, during the break. Well, not nonstop, but I do like gigging and touring. A lot, yeah. Did that put, do you think that put you in a different place than Carrie and Corin when you guys all got back in a room together and started hitting it? I think mostly as a drummer, it's so physical. It's, and it involves a lot of feel and a lot of timing that it's like playing tennis or something. If you stop doing it for six months, you're gonna, you're gonna pay for it big time. You're, it's gonna take a lot more momentum and practice and work to get back to where you were. Guitar playing is, you know, definitely you get better as you play more, but I don't think you lose so much of what you've, what you've got. Carrie, would you care to rebuke that? Is that true? About that? Well, it's less stamina based for sure. Like, but I do think even just touring, like from the beginning of the tour, the first leg of the U.S. tour to the end, I mean, my playing was much improved. I mean, you just, it's sort of the natural progression of... Well, you're doing it every night. Yeah, but certainly like there isn't a stamina that I think you need with, with drumming. I mean, I can always just grab a stool and hang out, chill out. With singing though, you, you definitely, you lose stamina and the breathing is really important. And so, yeah, I mean, it benefits all of us the more we play live. Sure. And Carrie and Corin, was it hard to get the rhythm of your vocal interchange again? No, not at all. Not the vocal interchange. Just getting up to the level of singing for Slater-Kinney is the most difficult, but in terms of the melody was there, like the songwriting was there, like how we enter, our vocals interplay with one another was there. But it just takes a lot for us to sing in the way we do for Slater-Kinney. And I'm kind of surprised we were able to get there before the live shows, but we've just, we really pushed it a lot. I also think that your voice changes over time, you know, so that's, I think that's part of it too. But, you know, for this record, we really tried to do a lot of different things. We tried a lot of different songs. We wrote a lot of, a lot of songs, 10 on the record, but we recorded 14, but we must have written at least 20. Probably close to 20. So, I mean, we tried a lot of different things to get kind of a variety of, of different sounds on the record, on the final. Product. How has the call and response between the two of you changed over the years? Let's try it. Right now. Well, there've been, there's been times when it's been a counterpoint, you know, sort of, you know, like oppositional things popping up and, but man, you guys are like totally locked in together on a lot of the tracks on this record. I think. No, go ahead. Nope. Look. That's how we write it. It's just so natural. We just argue and then they're like, hit record. They're bickering. Hit record. Hit record. Deliberate about our choices. So coming up with the, the catchiness of a song. I mean, Carrie would come back with, I've got this guitar part, you know, for like bury our friends. She was like, I've got this guitar part. You know, and she comes up with like this super catchy melody, but you know, how do you make that into a chorus? How do you make that into a song? You know? And, and it's usually the way I come into it is try and, and come up with a rhythm, a melodic rhythm that centers everything. I really just kind of beat myself up melody wise this, this time. Like I really, like I would, because we were recording every practice, I just wanted the choruses to really sing on this. Like I really wanted a chorus heavy album, at least on some of the songs. And this record, I felt like we all were really focused on the music. And coming at it from like a, you know, much more kind of willing to sacrifice our own, whatever our own agendas might be. I think in the case of this band, our, we really, our agenda is the music, the record. And we do often agree on what the best path is, but really it was like trying to get out of myself a little bit and get more into what, you know, what they're, what they're doing and making their thing sort of propelled. I don't know how much the, you know, the sounds on the woods, you know, paved any, any way for this. It's been so long since you guys recorded that, but I mean, Carrie, especially your, your guitar work on the woods was this enormous flaming exclamation point. Was there anything you were thinking about in terms of pushing your playing or how you were practicing or what you were listening to as you were getting ready to, to record this? Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, when, what we talked about earlier in terms of this kind of site specificity that goes along with writing, I mean, we were in a very sort of airtight room and when there's no reverb on guitar, I mean, the woods is all about, you know, we wrote a lot of that record when we were opening for Pearl Jam and we were playing amphitheaters and you get a sound that has a lot of space to it and reach. These guitar parts were written, it was kind of unforgiving, the room. So I needed all the parts to be succinct. I think some of my playing on the woods has kind of a verbosity to it that is not surprising considering that's how I am in real life, but I didn't really want to do it. I didn't really want that on this. And I was listening to a lot of things that have been produced by Nell Rogers and, you know, like Duran Duran or Bowie or Robert Fripp or just things that are just like these little phrases. Can you tell the extent to which, you know, maybe, maybe new listeners are getting to this material versus longtime fans this time around? Yeah, easily. It's palpable, especially at the live show, but also through social media. There are some people that had never even heard of this band until we put out Bury Our Friends, which is the single we released in advance of the record. And there are definitely people in the audience that are teenagers for whom the new material is the stuff they're most familiar with. And there's people in college and, you know, all the way up to, I guess, people that are around the first time that are, you know, in their 40s or 50s. So it's a really wide range. The front rows tend to be full of young kids, which you would expect at any concert and what you kind of hope for. So that's really exciting that just like us, we're not sort of tilting our ear towards the past. And the audience helps reflect that and makes it feel very vital. Well, obviously, all three of you have seen the music industry in about a million different ways since you started playing together and have been involved in different ways while you guys were taking a break from Slater Kinney. Is there anything you notice about how the music industry has changed during the interim? Well, obviously, everything is so much more online now than it was. I mean, the internet, you know, was kind of invented when we first started playing. What's the internet, Corey? I'll tell you later. So yeah, so that is really different, you know. Everything, every new song and everything that you are introduced to is now introduced online almost instantaneously. So yeah, that's just a different interface. And it kind of takes some getting used to. I'm just glad as a band, we still have a really incredible relationship with our fans in the live setting. Because I just think that's so important. It was never hard to just think, God, can we just get this out there that we're doing this? I think that we did discuss it over, you know, the couple of years that we did it. And, you know, after a lot of back and forth, I think it was like, well, we don't have what we're looking for yet, which is not just a good album, but a great album. We have to keep writing. So there was like a moment where we thought we could record earlier. And then we had to push it back because we just weren't ready. You know, I think part of the collaboration is we have really high standards for ourselves and for each other, the three of us. So yeah, there was some frustration. But, you know, I definitely think it was the right decision to push it back until we had a lot more strong material than we actually needed for one album. Are there fun things about getting back on the road? A lot of fun things. Too many fun things to eat, actually. I mean, there's tons of fun stuff on tour. I mean, the shows, that's the fun part. Yeah, like seeing all the different people out there that like our band now, it is like Carrie was describing, you know, having just this real variety of people come to the shows. It's pretty incredible. You know, there are like young kids and I mean like under 10. That will come to a show over 60. I mean, just the whole variety. That's something. More so than in the past. Yes, definitely. And it's pretty incredible to say that all different kinds of people like your music. That's really a dream come true. It's got to be people bringing their kids. For sure. Yeah. There's definitely families bringing their kids and saying like you have to see this band. Even to the signing that we did a record signing in L.A. and then we're definitely families bringing little kids, little girls where we would sign the albums for them, which is like just really

lost workshop space. We record the practices, so pretty much everything that happens in the practice gets put down, and then we can listen back to it. We have to take a little bit more time, I think, writing than maybe we used to when we would try things out in a live setting. But it was actually, in the end, I think it worked to our advantage to sort of create these explosive songs that were very concise, and the fat was very trimmed off these songs. Yeah, the whole record is very tight, 33 minutes. Yeah, I mean, if you could see the room where we wrote most of it, it's a very small room, and it's very dead-sounding, kind of an airless room. And I think the sort of the muscular quality that comes through on the record was like trying to make these things sort of happen in this airless room. Could you take us there to where you wrote the record? Physically or just verbally? Sure. All right, let's go. Yeah, I think we started writing in 2012 at Corinne's house first, and then I built out the practice space in my basement. We live all quite close to each other, actually, in Portland, so we looked for practice spaces, although privacy was something that we considered because it's hard to write in a space where you know other people can hear. So some of those, like, collective practice spaces where you're just in rooms with other bands next door, it's good for rehearsal and a lot more difficult to kind of figure out parts and think. Yeah, it was down there. It's pretty traditional for us to write in a basement. We've actually been doing that since the beginning. It's not that weird. I wanted to ask each of you if there were parts, you know, parts of yourself, parts of your musical selves that you could feel coming back online when you started playing together again. Yeah, I mean, I think that the Sleater-Kinney songwriting process is really unique. It is really special. The kind of sparks that we get in our practice space are really special to this band, and I think that we feel pretty comfortable just letting it all fly in the basement, you know, which is really conducive to getting a lot of cool ideas. I mean, I think even when we were writing Price Tag, you know, I was screaming the word price tag for some, you know, during the song. A lot of those ideas come from me as a songwriter when we're all working together. The combined collaboration between the three of us really starts a lot of those ideas for me, and I really just start, you know, singing or yelling things when we're all making all that noise together, you know. And so it is, you know, I did experience that feeling of like, wow, this is, it's still there. You know, we're still doing the same kind of thing we were doing all along. I think the idea of collaboration is very alive in this band. I think because of the, there is a mutual respect there, that kind of musical mutual respect that goes beyond, like, the real world in a way, the physical world, what's happening. It goes into like a, I don't know, it's like a spiritual thing, I guess. And I feel like I trust them to you know, I want to know what they, what their ideas are for the drums and what they think. And, you know, even, you know, direct ideas. And Carrie had great drum ideas for Bury Our Friends. And, you know, like, things that really make it feel like we're working on this thing with a common goal together. We can suggest ideas of the other instruments to each other and push each other, you know, you know, sometimes we want Corin to sing louder. And we push her to do so. I just think it's, it really feels like a true collaboration, which we all, which we all love. And you can tell that we all love it. You know, by how it comes across on stage, mostly, but in the writing as well. Janet, you were the only one here who was touring and gigging nonstop, I think, during the break. Well, not nonstop, but I do like gigging and touring. A lot, yeah. Did that put, do you think that put you in a different place than Carrie and Corin when you guys all got back in a room together and started hitting it? I think mostly as a drummer, it's so physical. It's, and it involves a lot of feel and a lot of timing that it's like playing tennis or something. If you stop doing it for six months, you're gonna, you're gonna pay for it big time. You're, it's gonna take a lot more momentum and practice and work to get back to where you were. Guitar playing is, you know, definitely you get better as you play more, but I don't think you lose so much of what you've, what you've got. Carrie, would you care to rebuke that? Is that true? About that? Well, it's less stamina based for sure. Like, but I do think even just touring, like from the beginning of the tour, the first leg of the U.S. tour to the end, I mean, my playing was much improved. I mean, you just, it's sort of the natural progression of... Well, you're doing it every night. Yeah, but certainly like there isn't a stamina that I think you need with, with drumming. I mean, I can always just grab a stool and hang out, chill out. With singing though, you, you definitely, you lose stamina and the breathing is really important. And so, yeah, I mean, it benefits all of us the more we play live. Sure. And Carrie and Corin, was it hard to get the rhythm of your vocal interchange again? No, not at all. Not the vocal interchange. Just getting up to the level of singing for Slater-Kinney is the most difficult, but in terms of the melody was there, like the songwriting was there, like how we enter, our vocals interplay with one another was there. But it just takes a lot for us to sing in the way we do for Slater-Kinney. And I'm kind of surprised we were able to get there before the live shows, but we've just, we really pushed it a lot. I also think that your voice changes over time, you know, so that's, I think that's part of it too. But, you know, for this record, we really tried to do a lot of different things. We tried a lot of different songs. We wrote a lot of, a lot of songs, 10 on the record, but we recorded 14, but we must have written at least 20. Probably close to 20. So, I mean, we tried a lot of different things to get kind of a variety of, of different sounds on the record, on the final. Product. How has the call and response between the two of you changed over the years? Let's try it. Right now. Well, there've been, there's been times when it's been a counterpoint, you know, sort of, you know, like oppositional things popping up and, but man, you guys are like totally locked in together on a lot of the tracks on this record. I think. No, go ahead. Nope. Look. That's how we write it. It's just so natural. We just argue and then they're like, hit record. They're bickering. Hit record. Hit record. Deliberate about our choices. So coming up with the, the catchiness of a song. I mean, Carrie would come back with, I've got this guitar part, you know, for like bury our friends. She was like, I've got this guitar part. You know, and she comes up with like this super catchy melody, but you know, how do you make that into a chorus? How do you make that into a song? You know? And, and it's usually the way I come into it is try and, and come up with a rhythm, a melodic rhythm that centers everything. I really just kind of beat myself up melody wise this, this time. Like I really, like I would, because we were recording every practice, I just wanted the choruses to really sing on this. Like I really wanted a chorus heavy album, at least on some of the songs. And this record, I felt like we all were really focused on the music. And coming at it from like a, you know, much more kind of willing to sacrifice our own, whatever our own agendas might be. I think in the case of this band, our, we really, our agenda is the music, the record. And we do often agree on what the best path is, but really it was like trying to get out of myself a little bit and get more into what, you know, what they're, what they're doing and making their thing sort of propelled. I don't know how much the, you know, the sounds on the woods, you know, paved any, any way for this. It's been so long since you guys recorded that, but I mean, Carrie, especially your, your guitar work on the woods was this enormous flaming exclamation point. Was there anything you were thinking about in terms of pushing your playing or how you were practicing or what you were listening to as you were getting ready to, to record this? Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, when, what we talked about earlier in terms of this kind of site specificity that goes along with writing, I mean, we were in a very sort of airtight room and when there's no reverb on guitar, I mean, the woods is all about, you know, we wrote a lot of that record when we were opening for Pearl Jam and we were playing amphitheaters and you get a sound that has a lot of space to it and reach. These guitar parts were written, it was kind of unforgiving, the room. So I needed all the parts to be succinct. I think some of my playing on the woods has kind of a verbosity to it that is not surprising considering that's how I am in real life, but I didn't really want to do it. I didn't really want that on this. And I was listening to a lot of things that have been produced by Nell Rogers and, you know, like Duran Duran or Bowie or Robert Fripp or just things that are just like these little phrases. Can you tell the extent to which, you know, maybe, maybe new listeners are getting to this material versus longtime fans this time around? Yeah, easily. It's palpable, especially at the live show, but also through social media. There are some people that had never even heard of this band until we put out Bury Our Friends, which is the single we released in advance of the record. And there are definitely people in the audience that are teenagers for whom the new material is the stuff they're most familiar with. And there's people in college and, you know, all the way up to, I guess, people that are around the first time that are, you know, in their 40s or 50s. So it's a really wide range. The front rows tend to be full of young kids, which you would expect at any concert and what you kind of hope for. So that's really exciting that just like us, we're not sort of tilting our ear towards the past. And the audience helps reflect that and makes it feel very vital. Well, obviously, all three of you have seen the music industry in about a million different ways since you started playing together and have been involved in different ways while you guys were taking a break from Slater Kinney. Is there anything you notice about how the music industry has changed during the interim? Well, obviously, everything is so much more online now than it was. I mean, the internet, you know, was kind of invented when we first started playing. What's the internet, Corey? I'll tell you later. So yeah, so that is really different, you know. Everything, every new song and everything that you are introduced to is now introduced online almost instantaneously. So yeah, that's just a different interface. And it kind of takes some getting used to. I'm just glad as a band, we still have a really incredible relationship with our fans in the live setting. Because I just think that's so important. It was never hard to just think, God, can we just get this out there that we're doing this? I think that we did discuss it over, you know, the couple of years that we did it. And, you know, after a lot of back and forth, I think it was like, well, we don't have what we're looking for yet, which is not just a good album, but a great album. We have to keep writing. So there was like a moment where we thought we could record earlier. And then we had to push it back because we just weren't ready. You know, I think part of the collaboration is we have really high standards for ourselves and for each other, the three of us. So yeah, there was some frustration. But, you know, I definitely think it was the right decision to push it back until we had a lot more strong material than we actually needed for one album. Are there fun things about getting back on the road? A lot of fun things. Too many fun things to eat, actually. I mean, there's tons of fun stuff on tour. I mean, the shows, that's the fun part. Yeah, like seeing all the different people out there that like our band now, it is like Carrie was describing, you know, having just this real variety of people come to the shows. It's pretty incredible. You know, there are like young kids and I mean like under 10. That will come to a show over 60. I mean, just the whole variety. That's something. More so than in the past. Yes, definitely. And it's pretty incredible to say that all different kinds of people like your music. That's really a dream come true. It's got to be people bringing their kids. For sure. Yeah. There's definitely families bringing their kids and saying like you have to see this band. Even to the signing that we did a record signing in L.A. and then we're definitely families bringing little kids, little girls where we would sign the albums for them, which is like just really
