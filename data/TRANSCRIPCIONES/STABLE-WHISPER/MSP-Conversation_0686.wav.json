{"text": " Well, anyway. Terrible act right now. He was lamenting how Matthew Eastwood would never get a nomination because you had, well, this was the year where True Detective was happening. And so all those, True Detective season one. True Detective is not within the eligibility period. And people hate season two. Yeah, it's not going to get nominated. But no, The Americans is, The Americans is a show that is not in the, it's like not in the category where it's like, it could never be nominated because it has all of the trappings of a show that could be nominated. And like, I think that the only thing is that like people doesn't rate very highly. So I don't know that like enough people are watching it. So like something like on FX, like Sons of Anarchy would be nominated all the time. It was? Wasn't it? It was nominated a lot. Sons of Anarchy is like so kind of, um. That's what I mean. It's like, well, why isn't The Americans getting nominated? Because it's like so much better. Yeah. But yeah. So like that show has all of the trappings of like an Emmy award winning worthy show. And for some reason it just gets overlooked constantly. It's probably one of the best shows on television actually. And probably has some of the best acting on television actually. Matthew Reese always has great things to do. He's wonderful in every like iteration of the characters that he plays. Yeah. He wears amazing wigs. Plus I love him in real life. He's like the most adorable man person. Um. And the show gives him kind of like more drama to do. He probably gets the most. Yeah. Like so. And he just brings, I don't know, there's something just about his face that like he just brings so much to that role. It's a good face. It's not a Russian face, but it's a good one. Yeah, but it could be. No. It's okay. Um, all right. What's your other, your main macaroni, the bigger one? My main macaroni is for, Sam Heughan for Outlander who plays Jamie Fraser, King of Men. Um, and I'm giving him a macaroni Emmy because he will not stop fucking retweeting things about online polls for him to win Emmys and other awards. He's so bitter that his episode is not getting him an actual. I will admit I have notifications on for like half the cast of this show and it is constantly lighting up with him retweeting stuff about him getting nominated. And it thinks. Um, but at the same time, like I think he's great. Like he, especially in the latter part of the season, in the finale, in the last two episodes, which, you know, I know are very controversial and ridiculous episodes, but like he's so, he was so good in them. And I think in a, in a way that I think like surprised me for him being this kind of like, I'm the like hot guy, King of Men. They call him that like on the set. Like that's what he's like referring to. This character who kind of comes from these novels where he starts as this, um, just sort of perfect man. Perfect in every way, guys. Um, so like, and then the first half of the season, he's not really like as kind of big of a character. Um, so I think that when they actually like gave him a lot more to do, I thought I found him very surprising and very good. So did he. Cause he's just retweeting those polls about him. Is that classy? Is that, do we call that classy? I don't know. Sometimes I am annoyed and sometimes I think it's adorable. I go back and forth. I think it's not classy. Hashtag, hashtag not classy. Okay. Lead actress. Yeah. Taraji P. Henson, Empire, Claire Danes, Homeland, Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder, Tatiana Maslany, Orphan Black, Elizabeth Moss, Mad Men, and Robin Wright, House of Curds. Hey. Pretty great one. Good one. Also had some very surprising things like snubbing Julianna Margulies, which we discussed already. And nominating Tatiana Maslany finally for Orphan Black. Yes. So like that is a thing that we're pointing to, to sort of be like this year is kind of way better than it has been the last many moons. And like that is a tiny show on BBC America that is super genre. Like clones. Like, but you have this one actress playing a hundred million characters, very different characters in a way where you do kind of forget that you're seeing one person. And it's absolutely a deserving nominee. Although like I didn't like this last season. So then when that kind of thing happens, I kind of go, eh, like maybe we should not be nominated when the season's not very good. And like previous seasons, she's even been better in them. Yeah, it's true. But I will not at all like complain about like her being there because she's a delightful person. She is super talented. This part is killer. And like it shows that there is hope for kind of all the people that we're giving the macaronis to. Yeah. And, you know, we sort of knew that Viola would get in there when we watched it. However, I hear her, you know, tape that she submitted is not her big thing. It's like a big scene that everybody would think would be her super dramatic scene. Right. Where she takes her makeup off. Yeah, she takes her makeup off. Kind of like, what is that movie? Glenn Close? Oh my gosh. Dangerous Liaison. Yeah, yeah. So it was like a Dangerous Liaison scene where she takes off her- But no, but that's not the, that's so different. No, but it's- In terms of what's going on. But it's what it is. No, I know what you mean. So that's what the scene was. She's sitting in front of a mirror. She takes off her makeup slowly. No, no, you mean, yeah, yeah. She takes off her hair, which you think is like her hair, but it's like a wig. And it's like her armor for the courtroom or whatever. And then she like yelled a lot. So that was like, oh, that's your tape right there. You're going to win an Emmy for that. And I guess she did not submit that. And we kind of fell off that show. Yeah, I mean, I, yeah, I can't really do it. I did not like it. But she's great and good for her for being nominated. Homeland supposedly got way better. In season four again. So- Did you not watch it? Yeah. Because I fell off that one too. Because it got real bad. But again, I hear that it picked itself up again. And that's always impressive. And I always give shows props for that. And Empire, Cookie. Yeah, I've never seen Empire, but I'm sure it's great. It's all about Cookie though. It looks like super fun. That's all I hear as well. Good for her. Good for her to write. Yeah. Like it's on my list. Like, you know, it's on the list. And then of course, Liz is more. It's whatever. She's on there. Yeah. No, she's great. The Arya Stark of Mad Men. I think she's great. She's very good. She deserves to be there. Yeah, yeah. It's not like it's exciting to me. Like, you know, but she's good. She's good. I like her a lot. And Robin Wright, who had just, wow, what a season. Yeah. Robin Wright is amazing. Not only did she, I mean, she's obviously nominated for directing here, but she directed like four episodes of that season and was quite- Yes. All those Instagrams of her behind the scenes directing and her little directing hat. And stuff. So great. So great. But the character had, what a year. Yes. So, I hope she wins. I really, really do. Yeah, the arc for Clara this season is nuts. Clara's incredible. Yeah. So, that's who I hope actually wins. So, macaronis. Yeah. Go forth. You go. Well, obviously, the big macaroni for me goes to Vera Farmiga, who was once on the list. The macaroni man. Yeah. Well, she was once on this list and never again and should have been for sure. Yeah. So, she could be nominated maybe someday because, like, she's a big name, you know? She is a big name. So, like, you know, that could trump anything like this show. And it's her birthday today. Yes, it is. Well, hopefully- Well, when this goes up, it's not- Well, not when you post this, but you know when we recorded this. On her birthday. Yeah. Look it up on IMDB. Yeah. But, yeah, she really deserved it. And we already discussed them back in, episode one. The episode that- Laura Louise. You know, yeah. She was just like a tour de force of it. And, you know, basically the biggest life of that show. Yeah. I mean, this character obviously is this sort of thing from Psycho that this is not a character that existed before, but had this kind of presence in that universe. It's the Bates Motel guys. Yeah, Bates Motel. And so, you know, like, Norman dressing as Norma. But, like, this show is, like, bringing that character to life. And, like, what would she be like? And, like, all this stuff. And, like, Vera Farmiga has a very unique, like, way of acting. And it's just a very unique human. It just, like, brings, like, so much to the character. She's perfect. Yeah. I don't know. Like, indescribable. Go look at, like, Richard Lawson's tweets about Vera Farmiga. I think he gets her- Her essence. Her essence the most. And then also, if you're not following Titus Burgess already, whenever Bates Motel is on, he has the best reactions to that show. Like, hands down. And he would agree that she should have a macaroni and meat. Yeah. For being the best. Like, this is a tour de force performance. Yeah. Like, it really is. Absolutely. The other one is Keri Russell for the Americans. Yeah. I think that we both kind of agree that we always want them to give her even more to do. What we said earlier, that they give Matthew Rhys the most to do. Well, it's an interesting thing. It's not just because he's the man. It really isn't. Yeah. It's because he sort of inhabits this feminine, more feminine- Feminine? He inhabits the more typically, like, archetypically feminine- Yes. You did it again. Feminine. Do you want to cut that out? No, I don't. You're going to hear this. He embodies the more, like, lady role. You didn't even finish your wine. Oh, yeah. We're drinking wine today, not scotch. Oh, yeah. We didn't say- Yeah, it's wine. And it's- Cab Franc. Cab Franc from the Finger Lakes. Yes, it is. Okay. So, she kind of has, like, the more masculine. She's more, like, hard, like, stony. Yes. Well, that's the thing about- So, Keri Russell sort of brings this ferocity and intensity to this character who- She is kind of, like, the baddest of the bad guys. Yeah. Because, like, our protagonists are the bad guys. Baddies. They're the Russians. They are Russian, and they are anti-America. This is in the 80s. This is in the Cold War. If you don't know what the Americans is, that's what it is. Yeah. So, they're our spies. And she is the one who kind of takes the hard line on everything. Yeah. She's very loyal. You know, she wants- This season is sort of about, like, their daughter, Paige, finds out that they're spies. She wants to have her participate in kind of becoming a spy. Yeah. Well, you know, part of their- Yeah. Lives and, you know, for their causes and stuff. And part of the drums was her kind of butting heads with Philip about what they should do. Yeah. He does not want that. He wants them to be normal kids in America. Yeah. And not spies. But, yeah, I think she just has a very great way of bringing this sort of- Like, she's not- I mean, you don't want to really say cold, but, like, she's just very intense. Yeah. And driven. And- But you know that she cares about her family. And she loves Philip. She's just, like, less outwardly emotional- Yeah. Like, than him. Yeah. Which is what makes him be the more typically- Right. Female role. And so, like, this season was particularly interesting because, like I said, she has the stuff with Paige. And then she also has the stuff with her own mother. Yeah. Where she goes to, like, visit her. Her mother is, like, dying in Russia. And she gets to go visit her. So there's kind of all these themes going on. And, like, she's just so good. Yep. And your last macaroni- Oh, yeah. Oh, guys. Oh, surprise. Who's left? My last macaroni of the night goes to Katrina Belf. What's your last macaroni of the night? Oh, yeah. Of the acting awards. Yeah. Katrina Belf, who plays Claire on- AKA The Beef. Yes. We call her The Beef. Continue. I'm not going to explain that. Don't explain that. Anyway. She plays Claire as the main protagonist of Outlander, as I've probably explained to you a hundred times already. And I- She was kind of, like, a revelation, I think, for me in this role. That show mostly has, like, unknown or unknown-to-me people in it. And she doesn't really have, like, that big of an IMDb before this. And then, like, some of her biggest movies she, like, doesn't even talk in, like Super 8. So this was kind of her first major role. And I think if you watch the season, you can just kind of watch her getting better and better and better. Do you not agree? Yeah. I mean, I think she's great. She kind of- Because she comes from a modeling background, she reminded me of Trisha Helfer in that way, where this is a model, Trisha Helfer from Battlestar Galactica, who played one of the- She's, like, the main, kind of- What would you call her? Does Ron Moore like to cast models in shows? Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Excuse me. I curse because you just- Look at my mind. Because I'm like, same guy. He sees all the hidden acting potential in supermodels. Wow. Yeah. So, Ron Moore, who does both these shows, definitely likes to cast gorgeous models. Anyway, this- But who can act? Yes. And I think she's great. And probably is the main reason that I became so obsessed with this show, because I think that this character, who is this sort of woman out of time, is just a phenomenal character. She's just- I love everything about her. She has, like, a great sense of humor. She has, like, a great- She's just very- Ooh, I love her. Like, what- Do you love Claire? Do you? I do. I love Claire. I just, like- I think that- And then the whole show would, I think, completely unravel and fall apart if they didn't have as great a person in this role. Yeah. I mean, she was really important to cast. As her. So- And- Yeah, I don't know. Like, do you want me to, like, go on all night about Trisha Helfer? No. I think she just deserves that little macaroni Emmy on her mantle. On to Outstanding Comedy Series. This is supposed to be a minisode. It's not, like, the longest episode. It is not. Sorry, guys. Outstanding Comedy Series. Louie, Modern Family, Parks and Recreation, Silicon Valley, Transparent, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Veep. So, again, I think that Transparent is going to win this, because they're going to sweep. It's what I think. But I'm really, really, really, really, really happy that Kimmy Schmidt is nominated. I think I've mentioned that already. Yeah. You have. But it's really great. I'm just so surprised by that. I do wish the comeback was on here. That's my macaroni. The comeback. Yeah. The comeback would be mine, too. Like, did I write even anything down? Oh, Broad City. Yeah, we mentioned Broad City. I love Broad City. It's smart. It's delightful. The comeback is- It's just, like, yeah. I think that, as a show, it was well put together. More so than, like, than just, like, nominating Lisa Kudrow, you know? So, the whole thing, I mean, she's incredible and, like, the main part of it, but the whole thing was so great, and the season was just so strong. Like, so strong, you just want it to come back again. Come back again, please. Agreed. So, yeah, that's definitely my macaroni right there. Sweet. Yeah. The end. Any other? No? Nah. Okay. Last one. Drums. Drums. All right. Better Call Saul, Downton Abbey. Why is that mine? Game of Thrones, Hermland, House of Cards, Mad Men, and Orange is the New Black. Okay, so this is Mad Men's last year. Yeah. It could very well win. It could. Because it's Mad Men. Yep. And it's its last year. Yep. And that's kind of what happens sometimes. I mean, Mad Men, I think, is great. We talked about it in, like, very early on, our, like, weird relationship with Mad Men, but it is a great and important- It's a great season, so that's why I'm so sour on it. But, again, I know. Yeah. It wasn't its best season. Because it's not a season. It was cut. And then, so it's like, do you just give a show an award because it's going away? And just for its contribution to television on the whole? Or do you go, this maybe wasn't your best season, there are other shows that are better? It's hard. It's hard. Because, like, you do sort of- There's so many instances where that does happen. The last kind of- Even, like, in movies, there are, like, a trilogy or whatever. The last one gets, like, all the awards, even though, let's say, the first one was better. Like, the Three Colors trilogy, where red is not as good as blue. Right. And it was first. And red got all the awards. That's a reference that everybody's going to understand. Okay. There's another movie you guys should all see. Or the three movies. Yeah. The Three Colors trilogy. So, well, okay. Return of the King was kind of the best one, but it also got all the awards. Well, okay, my analogies are terrible. But Mad Men could win, is what we're trying to say, because of- just specifically because it is the last year, and they're rewarding the whole thing, sort of. I mean, it hasn't actually won since, like, season three or something like that, right? Season two, season three. Because then Breaking Bad started. Right. And Breaking Bad won everything. And just for, like, ever. Jon Hamm never won because- Yeah. Well, he probably didn't really- Hmm? Jon Hamm? I was going to say my thing about Jon Hamm, which is that, like, he deserves to be nominated. But maybe not win. Yeah. It's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true. So, I want it to be Game of Thrones. Obviously. A hundred million macaronis as well. They also had a really interesting, controversial, just dramatic- It's so good. Great season. It is- Again, with the- Controversies doesn't mean it shouldn't win awards. No, but I mean- And people misunderstood most of it. Anyway. Yeah, but I mean, that put it sort of in the spotlight for people. People were aware of it. People who don't even watch it, like, knew what those controversies were. Yeah. And they involved my favorite characters, and that's great. But it kind of has a chance, I guess. But then, of course, you have your House of Cards and your Mad Men. Yeah, House of Cards. You know, we love House of Cards. I don't know. I'm just basing it on- It might win, because it just- Sometimes it does, I feel like. I'm basing it on- It's a really strong season, and just how I feel about it. I thought it was a really strong season, and this now includes the Doug stuff, which people do like. So, it could go in its favor. But how about those macaronis? Oh, okay. So, mine, I'll just give to Outlander, because I love it the most. Macaroni to Outlander is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. You guys, have I mentioned that I really love Outlander? I really love it a lot.

Terrible act right now. He was lamenting how Matthew Eastwood would never get a nomination because you had, well, this was the year where True Detective was happening. And so all those, True Detective season one. True Detective is not within the eligibility period. And people hate season two. Yeah, it's not going to get nominated. But no, The Americans is, The Americans is a show that is not in the, it's like not in the category where it's like, it could never be nominated because it has all of the trappings of a show that could be nominated. And like, I think that the only thing is that like people doesn't rate very highly. So I don't know that like enough people are watching it. So like something like on FX, like Sons of Anarchy would be nominated all the time. It was? Wasn't it? It was nominated a lot. Sons of Anarchy is like so kind of, um. That's what I mean. It's like, well, why isn't The Americans getting nominated? Because it's like so much better. Yeah. But yeah. So like that show has all of the trappings of like an Emmy award winning worthy show. And for some reason it just gets overlooked constantly. It's probably one of the best shows on television actually. And probably has some of the best acting on television actually. Matthew Reese always has great things to do. He's wonderful in every like iteration of the characters that he plays. Yeah. He wears amazing wigs. Plus I love him in real life. He's like the most adorable man person. Um. And the show gives him kind of like more drama to do. He probably gets the most. Yeah. Like so. And he just brings, I don't know, there's something just about his face that like he just brings so much to that role. It's a good face. It's not a Russian face, but it's a good one. Yeah, but it could be. No. It's okay. Um, all right. What's your other, your main macaroni, the bigger one? My main macaroni is for, Sam Heughan for Outlander who plays Jamie Fraser, King of Men. Um, and I'm giving him a macaroni Emmy because he will not stop fucking retweeting things about online polls for him to win Emmys and other awards. He's so bitter that his episode is not getting him an actual. I will admit I have notifications on for like half the cast of this show and it is constantly lighting up with him retweeting stuff about him getting nominated. And it thinks. Um, but at the same time, like I think he's great. Like he, especially in the latter part of the season, in the finale, in the last two episodes, which, you know, I know are very controversial and ridiculous episodes, but like he's so, he was so good in them. And I think in a, in a way that I think like surprised me for him being this kind of like, I'm the like hot guy, King of Men. They call him that like on the set. Like that's what he's like referring to. This character who kind of comes from these novels where he starts as this, um, just sort of perfect man. Perfect in every way, guys. Um, so like, and then the first half of the season, he's not really like as kind of big of a character. Um, so I think that when they actually like gave him a lot more to do, I thought I found him very surprising and very good. So did he. Cause he's just retweeting those polls about him. Is that classy? Is that, do we call that classy? I don't know. Sometimes I am annoyed and sometimes I think it's adorable. I go back and forth. I think it's not classy. Hashtag, hashtag not classy. Okay. Lead actress. Yeah. Taraji P. Henson, Empire, Claire Danes, Homeland, Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder, Tatiana Maslany, Orphan Black, Elizabeth Moss, Mad Men, and Robin Wright, House of Curds. Hey. Pretty great one. Good one. Also had some very surprising things like snubbing Julianna Margulies, which we discussed already. And nominating Tatiana Maslany finally for Orphan Black. Yes. So like that is a thing that we're pointing to, to sort of be like this year is kind of way better than it has been the last many moons. And like that is a tiny show on BBC America that is super genre. Like clones. Like, but you have this one actress playing a hundred million characters, very different characters in a way where you do kind of forget that you're seeing one person. And it's absolutely a deserving nominee. Although like I didn't like this last season. So then when that kind of thing happens, I kind of go, eh, like maybe we should not be nominated when the season's not very good. And like previous seasons, she's even been better in them. Yeah, it's true. But I will not at all like complain about like her being there because she's a delightful person. She is super talented. This part is killer. And like it shows that there is hope for kind of all the people that we're giving the macaronis to. Yeah. And, you know, we sort of knew that Viola would get in there when we watched it. However, I hear her, you know, tape that she submitted is not her big thing. It's like a big scene that everybody would think would be her super dramatic scene. Right. Where she takes her makeup off. Yeah, she takes her makeup off. Kind of like, what is that movie? Glenn Close? Oh my gosh. Dangerous Liaison. Yeah, yeah. So it was like a Dangerous Liaison scene where she takes off her- But no, but that's not the, that's so different. No, but it's- In terms of what's going on. But it's what it is. No, I know what you mean. So that's what the scene was. She's sitting in front of a mirror. She takes off her makeup slowly. No, no, you mean, yeah, yeah. She takes off her hair, which you think is like her hair, but it's like a wig. And it's like her armor for the courtroom or whatever. And then she like yelled a lot. So that was like, oh, that's your tape right there. You're going to win an Emmy for that. And I guess she did not submit that. And we kind of fell off that show. Yeah, I mean, I, yeah, I can't really do it. I did not like it. But she's great and good for her for being nominated. Homeland supposedly got way better. In season four again. So- Did you not watch it? Yeah. Because I fell off that one too. Because it got real bad. But again, I hear that it picked itself up again. And that's always impressive. And I always give shows props for that. And Empire, Cookie. Yeah, I've never seen Empire, but I'm sure it's great. It's all about Cookie though. It looks like super fun. That's all I hear as well. Good for her. Good for her to write. Yeah. Like it's on my list. Like, you know, it's on the list. And then of course, Liz is more. It's whatever. She's on there. Yeah. No, she's great. The Arya Stark of Mad Men. I think she's great. She's very good. She deserves to be there. Yeah, yeah. It's not like it's exciting to me. Like, you know, but she's good. She's good. I like her a lot. And Robin Wright, who had just, wow, what a season. Yeah. Robin Wright is amazing. Not only did she, I mean, she's obviously nominated for directing here, but she directed like four episodes of that season and was quite- Yes. All those Instagrams of her behind the scenes directing and her little directing hat. And stuff. So great. So great. But the character had, what a year. Yes. So, I hope she wins. I really, really do. Yeah, the arc for Clara this season is nuts. Clara's incredible. Yeah. So, that's who I hope actually wins. So, macaronis. Yeah. Go forth. You go. Well, obviously, the big macaroni for me goes to Vera Farmiga, who was once on the list. The macaroni man. Yeah. Well, she was once on this list and never again and should have been for sure. Yeah. So, she could be nominated maybe someday because, like, she's a big name, you know? She is a big name. So, like, you know, that could trump anything like this show. And it's her birthday today. Yes, it is. Well, hopefully- Well, when this goes up, it's not- Well, not when you post this, but you know when we recorded this. On her birthday. Yeah. Look it up on IMDB. Yeah. But, yeah, she really deserved it. And we already discussed them back in, episode one. The episode that- Laura Louise. You know, yeah. She was just like a tour de force of it. And, you know, basically the biggest life of that show. Yeah. I mean, this character obviously is this sort of thing from Psycho that this is not a character that existed before, but had this kind of presence in that universe. It's the Bates Motel guys. Yeah, Bates Motel. And so, you know, like, Norman dressing as Norma. But, like, this show is, like, bringing that character to life. And, like, what would she be like? And, like, all this stuff. And, like, Vera Farmiga has a very unique, like, way of acting. And it's just a very unique human. It just, like, brings, like, so much to the character. She's perfect. Yeah. I don't know. Like, indescribable. Go look at, like, Richard Lawson's tweets about Vera Farmiga. I think he gets her- Her essence. Her essence the most. And then also, if you're not following Titus Burgess already, whenever Bates Motel is on, he has the best reactions to that show. Like, hands down. And he would agree that she should have a macaroni and meat. Yeah. For being the best. Like, this is a tour de force performance. Yeah. Like, it really is. Absolutely. The other one is Keri Russell for the Americans. Yeah. I think that we both kind of agree that we always want them to give her even more to do. What we said earlier, that they give Matthew Rhys the most to do. Well, it's an interesting thing. It's not just because he's the man. It really isn't. Yeah. It's because he sort of inhabits this feminine, more feminine- Feminine? He inhabits the more typically, like, archetypically feminine- Yes. You did it again. Feminine. Do you want to cut that out? No, I don't. You're going to hear this. He embodies the more, like, lady role. You didn't even finish your wine. Oh, yeah. We're drinking wine today, not scotch. Oh, yeah. We didn't say- Yeah, it's wine. And it's- Cab Franc. Cab Franc from the Finger Lakes. Yes, it is. Okay. So, she kind of has, like, the more masculine. She's more, like, hard, like, stony. Yes. Well, that's the thing about- So, Keri Russell sort of brings this ferocity and intensity to this character who- She is kind of, like, the baddest of the bad guys. Yeah. Because, like, our protagonists are the bad guys. Baddies. They're the Russians. They are Russian, and they are anti-America. This is in the 80s. This is in the Cold War. If you don't know what the Americans is, that's what it is. Yeah. So, they're our spies. And she is the one who kind of takes the hard line on everything. Yeah. She's very loyal. You know, she wants- This season is sort of about, like, their daughter, Paige, finds out that they're spies. She wants to have her participate in kind of becoming a spy. Yeah. Well, you know, part of their- Yeah. Lives and, you know, for their causes and stuff. And part of the drums was her kind of butting heads with Philip about what they should do. Yeah. He does not want that. He wants them to be normal kids in America. Yeah. And not spies. But, yeah, I think she just has a very great way of bringing this sort of- Like, she's not- I mean, you don't want to really say cold, but, like, she's just very intense. Yeah. And driven. And- But you know that she cares about her family. And she loves Philip. She's just, like, less outwardly emotional- Yeah. Like, than him. Yeah. Which is what makes him be the more typically- Right. Female role. And so, like, this season was particularly interesting because, like I said, she has the stuff with Paige. And then she also has the stuff with her own mother. Yeah. Where she goes to, like, visit her. Her mother is, like, dying in Russia. And she gets to go visit her. So there's kind of all these themes going on. And, like, she's just so good. Yep. And your last macaroni- Oh, yeah. Oh, guys. Oh, surprise. Who's left? My last macaroni of the night goes to Katrina Belf. What's your last macaroni of the night? Oh, yeah. Of the acting awards. Yeah. Katrina Belf, who plays Claire on- AKA The Beef. Yes. We call her The Beef. Continue. I'm not going to explain that. Don't explain that. Anyway. She plays Claire as the main protagonist of Outlander, as I've probably explained to you a hundred times already. And I- She was kind of, like, a revelation, I think, for me in this role. That show mostly has, like, unknown or unknown-to-me people in it. And she doesn't really have, like, that big of an IMDb before this. And then, like, some of her biggest movies she, like, doesn't even talk in, like Super 8. So this was kind of her first major role. And I think if you watch the season, you can just kind of watch her getting better and better and better. Do you not agree? Yeah. I mean, I think she's great. She kind of- Because she comes from a modeling background, she reminded me of Trisha Helfer in that way, where this is a model, Trisha Helfer from Battlestar Galactica, who played one of the- She's, like, the main, kind of- What would you call her? Does Ron Moore like to cast models in shows? Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Excuse me. I curse because you just- Look at my mind. Because I'm like, same guy. He sees all the hidden acting potential in supermodels. Wow. Yeah. So, Ron Moore, who does both these shows, definitely likes to cast gorgeous models. Anyway, this- But who can act? Yes. And I think she's great. And probably is the main reason that I became so obsessed with this show, because I think that this character, who is this sort of woman out of time, is just a phenomenal character. She's just- I love everything about her. She has, like, a great sense of humor. She has, like, a great- She's just very- Ooh, I love her. Like, what- Do you love Claire? Do you? I do. I love Claire. I just, like- I think that- And then the whole show would, I think, completely unravel and fall apart if they didn't have as great a person in this role. Yeah. I mean, she was really important to cast. As her. So- And- Yeah, I don't know. Like, do you want me to, like, go on all night about Trisha Helfer? No. I think she just deserves that little macaroni Emmy on her mantle. On to Outstanding Comedy Series. This is supposed to be a minisode. It's not, like, the longest episode. It is not. Sorry, guys. Outstanding Comedy Series. Louie, Modern Family, Parks and Recreation, Silicon Valley, Transparent, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Veep. So, again, I think that Transparent is going to win this, because they're going to sweep. It's what I think. But I'm really, really, really, really, really happy that Kimmy Schmidt is nominated. I think I've mentioned that already. Yeah. You have. But it's really great. I'm just so surprised by that. I do wish the comeback was on here. That's my macaroni. The comeback. Yeah. The comeback would be mine, too. Like, did I write even anything down? Oh, Broad City. Yeah, we mentioned Broad City. I love Broad City. It's smart. It's delightful. The comeback is- It's just, like, yeah. I think that, as a show, it was well put together. More so than, like, than just, like, nominating Lisa Kudrow, you know? So, the whole thing, I mean, she's incredible and, like, the main part of it, but the whole thing was so great, and the season was just so strong. Like, so strong, you just want it to come back again. Come back again, please. Agreed. So, yeah, that's definitely my macaroni right there. Sweet. Yeah. The end. Any other? No? Nah. Okay. Last one. Drums. Drums. All right. Better Call Saul, Downton Abbey. Why is that mine? Game of Thrones, Hermland, House of Cards, Mad Men, and Orange is the New Black. Okay, so this is Mad Men's last year. Yeah. It could very well win. It could. Because it's Mad Men. Yep. And it's its last year. Yep. And that's kind of what happens sometimes. I mean, Mad Men, I think, is great. We talked about it in, like, very early on, our, like, weird relationship with Mad Men, but it is a great and important- It's a great season, so that's why I'm so sour on it. But, again, I know. Yeah. It wasn't its best season. Because it's not a season. It was cut. And then, so it's like, do you just give a show an award because it's going away? And just for its contribution to television on the whole? Or do you go, this maybe wasn't your best season, there are other shows that are better? It's hard. It's hard. Because, like, you do sort of- There's so many instances where that does happen. The last kind of- Even, like, in movies, there are, like, a trilogy or whatever. The last one gets, like, all the awards, even though, let's say, the first one was better. Like, the Three Colors trilogy, where red is not as good as blue. Right. And it was first. And red got all the awards. That's a reference that everybody's going to understand. Okay. There's another movie you guys should all see. Or the three movies. Yeah. The Three Colors trilogy. So, well, okay. Return of the King was kind of the best one, but it also got all the awards. Well, okay, my analogies are terrible. But Mad Men could win, is what we're trying to say, because of- just specifically because it is the last year, and they're rewarding the whole thing, sort of. I mean, it hasn't actually won since, like, season three or something like that, right? Season two, season three. Because then Breaking Bad started. Right. And Breaking Bad won everything. And just for, like, ever. Jon Hamm never won because- Yeah. Well, he probably didn't really- Hmm? Jon Hamm? I was going to say my thing about Jon Hamm, which is that, like, he deserves to be nominated. But maybe not win. Yeah. It's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true. So, I want it to be Game of Thrones. Obviously. A hundred million macaronis as well. They also had a really interesting, controversial, just dramatic- It's so good. Great season. It is- Again, with the- Controversies doesn't mean it shouldn't win awards. No, but I mean- And people misunderstood most of it. Anyway. Yeah, but I mean, that put it sort of in the spotlight for people. People were aware of it. People who don't even watch it, like, knew what those controversies were. Yeah. And they involved my favorite characters, and that's great. But it kind of has a chance, I guess. But then, of course, you have your House of Cards and your Mad Men. Yeah, House of Cards. You know, we love House of Cards. I don't know. I'm just basing it on- It might win, because it just- Sometimes it does, I feel like. I'm basing it on- It's a really strong season, and just how I feel about it. I thought it was a really strong season, and this now includes the Doug stuff, which people do like. So, it could go in its favor. But how about those macaronis? Oh, okay. So, mine, I'll just give to Outlander, because I love it the most. Macaroni to Outlander is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. You guys, have I mentioned that I really love Outlander? I really love it a lot.
