{"text": " Right. So it's important to first understand that credit recovery is not new. The concept that you can fail a course and then have an option to retake it in some form. That has been around for quite a while. Online credit recovery, though, is relatively new, and we've seen it proliferate in the past five to ten years or so. And the two main reasons for that is, number one, with the advent of the No Child Left Behind Act and similar accountability policies, high schools were under much greater pressures to increase graduation rates, among other data-based outcomes. And so the other trend is that we've just seen in the past ten years more and more of a push to bring technology and digital learning into the classroom. And so that has been subsidized by the federal government. There's a number of reasons why that's really taken off, partly just technological advances but also some policy reasons. And so in the past ten years, we've really seen the traditional model of credit recovery, which was you retake a class in some form, be replaced mostly now with online credit recovery. And by that, I mean, let's say you fail Algebra 2, well, then you can enroll in an online or computer-based version of the course, go through a series of modules, and then receive credit for that course if you pass. And we can talk a little bit about that. That looks very different from school to school and from district to district, but that is the basic idea. And how widespread is the use of online credit recovery classes? What are the latest statistics? Yeah, so the first thing I guess I learned when I started reporting on this piece is that there's a lot more we don't know about online credit recovery than we do know it. So we have some idea of how prevalent this is and that we don't have very specific numbers. But the numbers that we do have indicate that it's very widespread, about 89 percent, according to one survey, high schools reported offering credit recovery, and a large percentage of that was online. We don't know a whole lot, but what we do know seems to indicate that it's pretty widespread. And just quickly, one recent study on online learning and credit recovery of the Milwaukee public schools revealed that nearly 40 percent of graduating seniors had participated in an online class, and most of that was for credit recovery. So that is a very significant amount of students. This isn't something that we're just talking about a few students here or there or a few districts here or there. This has become really a key element of many districts' strategies to increase graduation rates. Yeah, I think you report in the article that 15 percent of all high school students nationwide take at least one credit recovery class. Not all of that is necessarily online, though, but it looks like that's easily the most common format that schools are using currently. And consistent with your observation about Milwaukee, it looks to me from some of the data you report that the use of online credit recovery is highest in districts that are serving more disadvantaged students. Is that the case? Yes, that is the case. And some of that research has emerged just recently. And this is one thing that, again, we, until recently, didn't really know who or what students or what schools were using these strategies most. We are starting to get, we have started to gather information. And by we, I mean people who are much smarter than me studying this. That indicates that, yes, typically schools that have higher proportions of low-income students have more prevalent participation rates in online credit recovery. And, of course, those are the schools that are facing the greatest pressure to raise graduation rates to consistent with what you said may be driving the phenomenon more broadly. And what do we know about the quality of the courses students are taking and whether they're learning anything as a result? Right. So that is the big kind of question that I tried to get at in talking to a number of people who have looked at this issue. Unfortunately, again, the answer is we don't know a lot. But what we do know is that based on early research and also on media reports from several different places that the rigor and quality is often not what we would probably want it to be. The early research and media reports suggest that students are often finding very easy ways to basically game the system. In other words, Googling answers and not really being engaged with the course material. There's, in the Milwaukee study, they did some, quite a bit of observational recording and found that a general lack of student engagement and, again, not kind of a rigorous set of coursework that one might expect if you're taking a, say, algebra two. And so, again, what we do know suggests that there is not always, and it's hard to generalize because it looks different in different places, but oftentimes it's very easy for students to simply click through an online module without properly demonstrating mastery. Now, your article starts and ends with an investigation of credit recovery in Newburgh, New York, a school district about an hour north of New York City that had seen its graduation rate climb to 78% in 2018 from 66% just five years earlier. What happened there? And do you think it is telling as to what's happening more broadly? Yeah, so this is a really interesting example of Newburgh is a relatively, well, it's about 12% of the total students, about 1,000 students, mostly students of color, mostly low income. And it is somewhat of a microcosm of what's happening more broadly. So it had long struggled to raise graduation rates, but in the past five years, the graduation rates, as you mentioned, improved pretty significantly. And a key part of that was the district's use of online credit recovery. This kind of success story came to a dramatic end this spring, you might say, when a district attorney's investigation uncovered widespread misuse or abuse of the credit recovery program for the purpose of raising graduation rates. And so in this long report, they detailed a number of ways that it was misused. So it was teachers overriding grades, students getting credit for a course that they were only enrolled in for, in one case, 15 minutes, students getting unlimited attempts to take quizzes and tests, basically taking it over and over and over the same test until you pass. And just to read very quickly from, because I have it in front of me, the one part of this report from the district attorney's office, it says that the testimony revealed blind administration of a program that ultimately served as a disservice to the students most in need of it. But nonetheless, the testimony revealed blind administration of a program that ultimately served the district interest in increased graduation rates. And so this would be an interesting story, although maybe not that interesting to a broader audience if this was kind of a one-off example, but it actually fits a pattern, which we've alluded to that suggests that these credit recovery programs, when not properly implemented and not properly opened up, overseen are really ripe for misuse. And to the extent that that is a pattern, I guess it starts to raise questions about what is often presented as the nation's major accomplishment with respect to K-12 education in the past decade, which is boosting high school graduation rates to all-time levels. I think concerns have already been raised that that increase in graduation rates hasn't clearly been matched, by an increase in what students know and are able to do as measured by assessments like the National Assessment of Educational Progress. But this suggests even something more sinister going on. Right. I mean, it's difficult to make sweeping generalizations about, or to say to what extent online credit recovery has helped improve the graduation rates. I think it's important to look at that kind of information, and you might be able to look at that for a particular district. But I will say that, yes, along with concerns about grade inflation and other issues of, quote-unquote, lowering the bar to graduation, this kind of fits into those concerns. I think that is engaging students and is rigorous and high quality. But as we've seen in this Newburgh district and in many other districts, sometimes, and it makes sense given the policy incentives, the goal of increasing graduation, this has emerged as a kind of cheap technical fix or cheap technical solution to improving graduation rates. There is, I think, and among the people I've spoke to about this, a general sense of, all right, let's take a closer look at what is really going on with these programs and if students are really learning. And what about the providers of these courses? As I understand it, these are private companies. What do they have to say about how their products are being used? And in some cases, it seems misused by schools and districts. Yeah, so they're private companies, and so they're quick to take credit when there's a success story and quick to deflect when something like the Milwaukee study came out, which certainly wasn't good news for online credit recovery. And their response to that is basically, look, these programs, this software is a tool. Textbooks, which is the analogy they use, can be used well, and they can be used not so well. But we are simply providing the tool. So, you know, I'll let readers decide if they find that convincing. I mean, ultimately, it's up to districts and schools to select products that are helping their students. But yeah, you know, the private vendors, that's kind of their defense when the outcomes aren't so great. So what's the solution to the problem of misuse of online credit recovery? One of the experts you interviewed in the article said, look, the horse is out of the barn, suggesting, I think, that it's unlikely that online coursework is going to go away from American high schools. So what should we be doing and at what level to try and clean up the situation? So in order to find a solution to the problem, I think first we need to have a better understanding of what these programs look like, as I mentioned, who's taking them, what the student experience is. Beyond that, as you mentioned, it's unlikely to go away just because it's become pretty prevalent on U.S. high schools. But some states have started, well, three states in particular, have started requiring students to take an objective external exam in order to earn or recover credit. In other words, rather than just earning credit after going through a series of module, online modules and online quizzes, the students would then have to take an external or objective exam in order to recover credit. So that could look like an end-of-course exam or something like that. But that's basically a quality control or a safe bar to ensure that students are actually mastering the content. So that three states have done that. But I think, you know, we need better oversight of these programs to really understand and give districts and schools the tools that they need to properly vet these private providers and then implement the programs. And the not very satisfying answer, but the one that is still true for this, is that we need more research. And there is some work going on to better understand what quality actually looks like, because that's still kind of an open question. Like, what does a high-quality online learning course look like? We're still, in the grand scheme of things, this is all still relatively new. And in some ways, the information is playing catch-up to the fact that it is already widely implemented.

{"text": " Right. So it's important to first understand that credit recovery is not new. The concept that you can fail a course and then have an option to retake it in some form. That has been around for quite a while. Online credit recovery, though, is relatively new, and we've seen it proliferate in the past five to ten years or so. And the two main reasons for that is, number one, with the advent of the No Child Left Behind Act and similar accountability policies, high schools were under much greater pressures to increase graduation rates, among other data-based outcomes. And so the other trend is that we've just seen in the past ten years more and more of a push to bring technology and digital learning into the classroom. And so that has been subsidized by the federal government. There's a number of reasons why that's really taken off, partly just technological advances but also some policy reasons. And so in the past ten years, we've really seen the traditional model of credit recovery, which was you retake a class in some form, be replaced mostly now with online credit recovery. And by that, I mean, let's say you fail Algebra 2, well, then you can enroll in an online or computer-based version of the course, go through a series of modules, and then receive credit for that course if you pass. And we can talk a little bit about that. That looks very different from school to school and from district to district, but that is the basic idea. And how widespread is the use of online credit recovery classes? What are the latest statistics? Yeah, so the first thing I guess I learned when I started reporting on this piece is that there's a lot more we don't know about online credit recovery than we do know it. So we have some idea of how prevalent this is and that we don't have very specific numbers. But the numbers that we do have indicate that it's very widespread, about 89 percent, according to one survey, high schools reported offering credit recovery, and a large percentage of that was online. We don't know a whole lot, but what we do know seems to indicate that it's pretty widespread. And just quickly, one recent study on online learning and credit recovery of the Milwaukee public schools revealed that nearly 40 percent of graduating seniors had participated in an online class, and most of that was for credit recovery. So that is a very significant amount of students. This isn't something that we're just talking about a few students here or there or a few districts here or there. This has become really a key element of many districts' strategies to increase graduation rates. Yeah, I think you report in the article that 15 percent of all high school students nationwide take at least one credit recovery class. Not all of that is necessarily online, though, but it looks like that's easily the most common format that schools are using currently. And consistent with your observation about Milwaukee, it looks to me from some of the data you report that the use of online credit recovery is highest in districts that are serving more disadvantaged students. Is that the case? Yes, that is the case. And some of that research has emerged just recently. And this is one thing that, again, we, until recently, didn't really know who or what students or what schools were using these strategies most. We are starting to get, we have started to gather information. And by we, I mean people who are much smarter than me studying this. That indicates that, yes, typically schools that have higher proportions of low-income students have more prevalent participation rates in online credit recovery. And, of course, those are the schools that are facing the greatest pressure to raise graduation rates to consistent with what you said may be driving the phenomenon more broadly. And what do we know about the quality of the courses students are taking and whether they're learning anything as a result? Right. So that is the big kind of question that I tried to get at in talking to a number of people who have looked at this issue. Unfortunately, again, the answer is we don't know a lot. But what we do know is that based on early research and also on media reports from several different places that the rigor and quality is often not what we would probably want it to be. The early research and media reports suggest that students are often finding very easy ways to basically game the system. In other words, Googling answers and not really being engaged with the course material. There's, in the Milwaukee study, they did some, quite a bit of observational recording and found that a general lack of student engagement and, again, not kind of a rigorous set of coursework that one might expect if you're taking a, say, algebra two. And so, again, what we do know suggests that there is not always, and it's hard to generalize because it looks different in different places, but oftentimes it's very easy for students to simply click through an online module without properly demonstrating mastery. Now, your article starts and ends with an investigation of credit recovery in Newburgh, New York, a school district about an hour north of New York City that had seen its graduation rate climb to 78% in 2018 from 66% just five years earlier. What happened there? And do you think it is telling as to what's happening more broadly? Yeah, so this is a really interesting example of Newburgh is a relatively, well, it's about 12% of the total students, about 1,000 students, mostly students of color, mostly low income. And it is somewhat of a microcosm of what's happening more broadly. So it had long struggled to raise graduation rates, but in the past five years, the graduation rates, as you mentioned, improved pretty significantly. And a key part of that was the district's use of online credit recovery. This kind of success story came to a dramatic end this spring, you might say, when a district attorney's investigation uncovered widespread misuse or abuse of the credit recovery program for the purpose of raising graduation rates. And so in this long report, they detailed a number of ways that it was misused. So it was teachers overriding grades, students getting credit for a course that they were only enrolled in for, in one case, 15 minutes, students getting unlimited attempts to take quizzes and tests, basically taking it over and over and over the same test until you pass. And just to read very quickly from, because I have it in front of me, the one part of this report from the district attorney's office, it says that the testimony revealed blind administration of a program that ultimately served as a disservice to the students most in need of it. But nonetheless, the testimony revealed blind administration of a program that ultimately served the district interest in increased graduation rates. And so this would be an interesting story, although maybe not that interesting to a broader audience if this was kind of a one-off example, but it actually fits a pattern, which we've alluded to that suggests that these credit recovery programs, when not properly implemented and not properly opened up, overseen are really ripe for misuse. And to the extent that that is a pattern, I guess it starts to raise questions about what is often presented as the nation's major accomplishment with respect to K-12 education in the past decade, which is boosting high school graduation rates to all-time levels. I think concerns have already been raised that that increase in graduation rates hasn't clearly been matched, by an increase in what students know and are able to do as measured by assessments like the National Assessment of Educational Progress. But this suggests even something more sinister going on. Right. I mean, it's difficult to make sweeping generalizations about, or to say to what extent online credit recovery has helped improve the graduation rates. I think it's important to look at that kind of information, and you might be able to look at that for a particular district. But I will say that, yes, along with concerns about grade inflation and other issues of, quote-unquote, lowering the bar to graduation, this kind of fits into those concerns. I think that is engaging students and is rigorous and high quality. But as we've seen in this Newburgh district and in many other districts, sometimes, and it makes sense given the policy incentives, the goal of increasing graduation, this has emerged as a kind of cheap technical fix or cheap technical solution to improving graduation rates. There is, I think, and among the people I've spoke to about this, a general sense of, all right, let's take a closer look at what is really going on with these programs and if students are really learning. And what about the providers of these courses? As I understand it, these are private companies. What do they have to say about how their products are being used? And in some cases, it seems misused by schools and districts. Yeah, so they're private companies, and so they're quick to take credit when there's a success story and quick to deflect when something like the Milwaukee study came out, which certainly wasn't good news for online credit recovery. And their response to that is basically, look, these programs, this software is a tool. Textbooks, which is the analogy they use, can be used well, and they can be used not so well. But we are simply providing the tool. So, you know, I'll let readers decide if they find that convincing. I mean, ultimately, it's up to districts and schools to select products that are helping their students. But yeah, you know, the private vendors, that's kind of their defense when the outcomes aren't so great. So what's the solution to the problem of misuse of online credit recovery? One of the experts you interviewed in the article said, look, the horse is out of the barn, suggesting, I think, that it's unlikely that online coursework is going to go away from American high schools. So what should we be doing and at what level to try and clean up the situation? So in order to find a solution to the problem, I think first we need to have a better understanding of what these programs look like, as I mentioned, who's taking them, what the student experience is. Beyond that, as you mentioned, it's unlikely to go away just because it's become pretty prevalent on U.S. high schools. But some states have started, well, three states in particular, have started requiring students to take an objective external exam in order to earn or recover credit. In other words, rather than just earning credit after going through a series of module, online modules and online quizzes, the students would then have to take an external or objective exam in order to recover credit. So that could look like an end-of-course exam or something like that. But that's basically a quality control or a safe bar to ensure that students are actually mastering the content. So that three states have done that. But I think, you know, we need better oversight of these programs to really understand and give districts and schools the tools that they need to properly vet these private providers and then implement the programs. And the not very satisfying answer, but the one that is still true for this, is that we need more research. And there is some work going on to better understand what quality actually looks like, because that's still kind of an open question. Like, what does a high-quality online learning course look like? We're still, in the grand scheme of things, this is all still relatively new. And in some ways, the information is playing catch-up to the fact that it is already widely implemented.
