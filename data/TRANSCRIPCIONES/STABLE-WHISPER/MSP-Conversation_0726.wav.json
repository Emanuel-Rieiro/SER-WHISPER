{"text": " and this was based on a video that I saw. I don't remember the video. It might have been a BuzzFeed video but it was when like these two people who were together for some time, they broke up and then they got them back together for the video to just talk about their relationships and everything like that and it seemed like a very vulnerable experience and like you guys know that's kind of what this whole podcast is supposed to be about. It's about focusing on the vulnerabilities of people's experiences, the things that we face as people of color and one of the most intimate points of that is like relationships and long-term relationships. So me and Jess were together for two years and then we separated. That sounds like a divorce. But yeah, so that's kind of what the premise of this was and I want to thank Jess in advance for agreeing to do this. So yeah, hopefully it will be a great listen and we're just gonna jump right in. So what's up Jess? How you doing today? I'm good. I'm awake. You're awake. Are you sure? I'm nervous. Nervous? Why are you nervous? Let's talk about that. Why are you nervous? Because we're talking about breakups. Like it's one, you were my first real relationship, my first love and it's something I'm still working to get through a year something later. And why do you think that is? Like why do you think you're still working through it? I think it's just because after we separated, broke up, whatever term you want to use, I kind of forced myself to just get really busy and focus on other things that I had going on. So DR, whatever I was doing while I was out in the DR, then getting ready for graduation and the whole time it was just kind of like, yeah, I'm working to get through this like one day at a time type of thing. But I still had to kind of find myself in the places that I felt comfortable in the spaces that I could inhabit. I think without having that like, oh, Kyle's girlfriend or Kyle's ex-girlfriend thing still attached to me for a really long time. Which is again, why I couldn't like get myself to live in the house. I couldn't be around the apartments that much. Like didn't really want to do the dance thing again because I needed to find me. And it's just now that like, okay, college is done with and I have like my place. I have a job and I'm doing all these other things that I get to. One, see all the growth that happened throughout the relationship. And then the growth that came after. And it's still coming. So when you say that title of Kyle's ex-girlfriend or Kyle's girlfriend, like did you place that upon yourself after the fact? Or was it like other people were placing that on you? Or you thought other people were placing that on you? I think it was both. Like the younger classes that definitely only knew you. Because I mean, who didn't really know you? I was like, oh, Kyle's girlfriend or the girl that you used to meet. Also, Jess is making me seem like Mr. Popular. You were. I'm not really. No, you were. I don't think that's an accurate view. But we can, we can, we can. That's debatable. That's debatable. There was that. And then it was just like, even people that knew me only by association. I was like, oh, you were with Kyle. Or, oh, I thought you graduated. Like, because Kyle, no, like I'm a 15. Doesn't go here anymore. And then it was just me too. Like, because you said we were together like two years. So whatever started between us, my freshman year for like us to break up, going into senior year made it be like, you're about to have a completely different experience for what is your senior year. So I had to figure out what I needed or wanted that to be. A lot of background story to everything. So I'm trying to like not confuse the people as we, as we jump into this. So me, me and Jess met her freshman year, my sophomore year. A little bit. I mean, a little bit into it. Like I was abroad and then I came back and then I met her, you know, top of 2012, 2012. Yeah. And then we didn't start going out. Like officially until September of that year. And so that's just a little bit of backstory. And basically to the, the decision to kind of end things was on me because I just felt like I wasn't in my, I wasn't at a place in life where I wanted to be in terms of my own happiness. And I didn't want that to, to affect Jess's life. And I, I, to be like completely honest, I think that we both still needed to grow a lot more individually before we could jump into anything serious. And I couldn't, I couldn't, it would be so, I thought it would be selfish of me to, to ask somebody to stay and wait for me and wait for me to figure things out while, while I was trying to figure out myself. Right. Like, I think it's, I think it's kind of selfish for me to say, all right, you, this is, this is going to be a huge whirlwind. So I stick around and stay tuned and find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z. Like, you know, like you never really know what's going to happen. And I, to be, to be honest, it's like a self, it's like a selfless thing. And it's a very selfish move on my end, I think in terms of wanting that, because in doing something like that, you're, you're, you're choosing to end something that, that two people enter together. And it's so, it's been, for so long, so intimate, you get so close to each other that it's a, it's a hard thing to do. And it's a hard thing to say out loud. And then it's a hard thing to accept in the long run. So I guess how, at the beginning, like how, how did you first deal with it? Like deal with the breakup? First deal with it? Other than those hours of crying, or what felt like hours of crying in your house. Really, really sad and pathetic moment. But the flight to DR was really rough. The first one. So from New York to Miami, I was one of those sad burrito things. Like you see those things on Tumblr. It's going to be like, I'm going to be a sad burrito thing. I took out the blanket that I had in my backpack, wrapped myself in it, because I happened to like have a rope to myself in the airplane. First time that's happened. Wrapped myself in it and just like bawled slash knocked out for the flight. Done. The flight attendant had to wake me up when we got to Miami. And then I was just kind of like, did that happen? Did it really happen? Because I had already texted you before I took off. And I was still trying to process it. I think I had texted or called Donnie before then. And then I had to call my dad. And that's when it got really rough. Because I was waiting for the flight from Miami to DR. And sitting there being like, one, I'm not going to be really calling my dad that much, because it'll be FaceTime, if anything. And I felt like I needed to let him know, because it's something that he had kind of like warned me about. Like part of it, and felt like something was going to happen. And he had tried telling me this before. And just one of those like, I want you to be like prepared. I want you to like, kind of know what might be happening, know how to take things. Because he's always asking about you. So when I called him, and then I was like, maybe 20 seconds into the call. And like, I like broke down while I was talking to him. Because one, I needed to say it in Spanish, I needed it to feel comfortable. For me, it was like, kind of downhill. And then it was a lot of crying. But I think after that, once I got to the DR, I kind of had to like, straighten up. I didn't really want to talk about it, pretended like nothing was happening. Lived with my roommates, did all the work. And then at night is when it'd be really rough, because I felt like I needed to talk to somebody, or I needed to write, couldn't really write. That's when Tumblr pretty much became my diary. That point, because I just needed to get things out. But it helped for me to be away and to not have to deal with it at school. Right from the beginning. I leaned on my brother and my dad a lot, while I was going through it. Which was really, really helpful. Because they were just understanding. Mad, yes, but very understanding. And one of the girls who happened to be my roommate, out there, Johanny. She was literally like my saving grace. She was 26, and she turned 26 while we were out there. And she just kind of helped me see things from like, a different perspective. And then just kind of talk things out. It also helped, she was a therapist. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, and see things in a different way, like how? Like what did she say that you think stuck with you? I think it wasn't so much like what she said, but it was just kind of like me irritating, not irritating, like reiterating your reasons. And then like, again, it's not like I ever doubted your reasons or anything, but it was just still really hard to hear. And then kind of like going through my head, like maybe like what happened, or like why that came about, and how things happened, is what I was trying to do. And like, I talked to her about, but also I was out in the DR. So like going to the beach and like giving myself that time, or taking it while I was with the girls. Like kind of working to accept it, because I mean, what I was, I turned 21. And for them, it was really awkward. It was really hard to see a girl or a woman who's 21, who's not married, who doesn't have kids. Oh. Yeah, they would ask all the time, like, where is your husband? Where are your kids? Do you have any type of thing? And you're talking about men in the DR? No, I'm talking about the girls, the ones that I worked with. Oh, really? Like the 8 to 14 year olds that I was working with. Oh, okay. Wow. All right. Yeah. They'd ask all the time. And I think it was just those things where I was like, I had to kind of take and process, and then just be like, well, this is kind of what things are right now.", "segments": [{"start": 0.66, "end":

"ori_dict": {"text": " and this was based on a video that I saw. I don't remember the video. It might have been a BuzzFeed video but it was when like these two people who were together for some time, they broke up and then they got them back together for the video to just talk about their relationships and everything like that and it seemed like a very vulnerable experience and like you guys know that's kind of what this whole podcast is supposed to be about. It's about focusing on the vulnerabilities of people's experiences, the things that we face as people of color and one of the most intimate points of that is like relationships and long-term relationships. So me and Jess were together for two years and then we separated. That sounds like a divorce. But yeah, so that's kind of what the premise of this was and I want to thank Jess in advance for agreeing to do this. So yeah, hopefully it will be a great listen and we're just gonna jump right in. So what's up Jess? How you doing today? I'm good. I'm awake. You're awake. Are you sure? I'm nervous. Nervous? Why are you nervous? Let's talk about that. Why are you nervous? Because we're talking about breakups. Like it's one, you were my first real relationship, my first love and it's something I'm still working to get through a year something later. And why do you think that is? Like why do you think you're still working through it? I think it's just because after we separated, broke up, whatever term you want to use, I kind of forced myself to just get really busy and focus on other things that I had going on. So DR, whatever I was doing while I was out in the DR, then getting ready for graduation and the whole time it was just kind of like, yeah, I'm working to get through this like one day at a time type of thing. But I still had to kind of find myself in the places that I felt comfortable in the spaces that I could inhabit. I think without having that like, oh, Kyle's girlfriend or Kyle's ex-girlfriend thing still attached to me for a really long time. Which is again, why I couldn't like get myself to live in the house. I couldn't be around the apartments that much. Like didn't really want to do the dance thing again because I needed to find me. And it's just now that like, okay, college is done with and I have like my place. I have a job and I'm doing all these other things that I get to. One, see all the growth that happened throughout the relationship. And then the growth that came after. And it's still coming. So when you say that title of Kyle's ex-girlfriend or Kyle's girlfriend, like did you place that upon yourself after the fact? Or was it like other people were placing that on you? Or you thought other people were placing that on you? I think it was both. Like the younger classes that definitely only knew you. Because I mean, who didn't really know you? I was like, oh, Kyle's girlfriend or the girl that you used to meet. Also, Jess is making me seem like Mr. Popular. You were. I'm not really. No, you were. I don't think that's an accurate view. But we can, we can, we can. That's debatable. That's debatable. There was that. And then it was just like, even people that knew me only by association. I was like, oh, you were with Kyle. Or, oh, I thought you graduated. Like, because Kyle, no, like I'm a 15. Doesn't go here anymore. And then it was just me too. Like, because you said we were together like two years. So whatever started between us, my freshman year for like us to break up, going into senior year made it be like, you're about to have a completely different experience for what is your senior year. So I had to figure out what I needed or wanted that to be. A lot of background story to everything. So I'm trying to like not confuse the people as we, as we jump into this. So me, me and Jess met her freshman year, my sophomore year. A little bit. I mean, a little bit into it. Like I was abroad and then I came back and then I met her, you know, top of 2012, 2012. Yeah. And then we didn't start going out. Like officially until September of that year. And so that's just a little bit of backstory. And basically to the, the decision to kind of end things was on me because I just felt like I wasn't in my, I wasn't at a place in life where I wanted to be in terms of my own happiness. And I didn't want that to, to affect Jess's life. And I, I, to be like completely honest, I think that we both still needed to grow a lot more individually before we could jump into anything serious. And I couldn't, I couldn't, it would be so, I thought it would be selfish of me to, to ask somebody to stay and wait for me and wait for me to figure things out while, while I was trying to figure out myself. Right. Like, I think it's, I think it's kind of selfish for me to say, all right, you, this is, this is going to be a huge whirlwind. So I stick around and stay tuned and find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z. Like, you know, like you never really know what's going to happen. And I, to be, to be honest, it's like a self, it's like a selfless thing. And it's a very selfish move on my end, I think in terms of wanting that, because in doing something like that, you're, you're, you're choosing to end something that, that two people enter together. And it's so, it's been, for so long, so intimate, you get so close to each other that it's a, it's a hard thing to do. And it's a hard thing to say out loud. And then it's a hard thing to accept in the long run. So I guess how, at the beginning, like how, how did you first deal with it? Like deal with the breakup? First deal with it? Other than those hours of crying, or what felt like hours of crying in your house. Really, really sad and pathetic moment. But the flight to DR was really rough. The first one. So from New York to Miami, I was one of those sad burrito things. Like you see those things on Tumblr. It's going to be like, I'm going to be a sad burrito thing. I took out the blanket that I had in my backpack, wrapped myself in it, because I happened to like have a rope to myself in the airplane. First time that's happened. Wrapped myself in it and just like bawled slash knocked out for the flight. Done. The flight attendant had to wake me up when we got to Miami. And then I was just kind of like, did that happen? Did it really happen? Because I had already texted you before I took off. And I was still trying to process it. I think I had texted or called Donnie before then. And then I had to call my dad. And that's when it got really rough. Because I was waiting for the flight from Miami to DR. And sitting there being like, one, I'm not going to be really calling my dad that much, because it'll be FaceTime, if anything. And I felt like I needed to let him know, because it's something that he had kind of like warned me about. Like part of it, and felt like something was going to happen. And he had tried telling me this before. And just one of those like, I want you to be like prepared. I want you to like, kind of know what might be happening, know how to take things. Because he's always asking about you. So when I called him, and then I was like, maybe 20 seconds into the call. And like, I like broke down while I was talking to him. Because one, I needed to say it in Spanish, I needed it to feel comfortable. For me, it was like, kind of downhill. And then it was a lot of crying. But I think after that, once I got to the DR, I kind of had to like, straighten up. I didn't really want to talk about it, pretended like nothing was happening. Lived with my roommates, did all the work. And then at night is when it'd be really rough, because I felt like I needed to talk to somebody, or I needed to write, couldn't really write. That's when Tumblr pretty much became my diary. That point, because I just needed to get things out. But it helped for me to be away and to not have to deal with it at school. Right from the beginning. I leaned on my brother and my dad a lot, while I was going through it. Which was really, really helpful. Because they were just understanding. Mad, yes, but very understanding. And one of the girls who happened to be my roommate, out there, Johanny. She was literally like my saving grace. She was 26, and she turned 26 while we were out there. And she just kind of helped me see things from like, a different perspective. And then just kind of talk things out. It also helped, she was a therapist. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, and see things in a different way, like how? Like what did she say that you think stuck with you? I think it wasn't so much like what she said, but it was just kind of like me irritating, not irritating, like reiterating your reasons. And then like, again, it's not like I ever doubted your reasons or anything, but it was just still really hard to hear. And then kind of like going through my head, like maybe like what happened, or like why that came about, and how things happened, is what I was trying to do. And like, I talked to her about, but also I was out in the DR. So like going to the beach and like giving myself that time, or taking it while I was with the girls. Like kind of working to accept it, because I mean, what I was, I turned 21. And for them, it was really awkward. It was really hard to see a girl or a woman who's 21, who's not married, who doesn't have kids. Oh. Yeah, they would ask all the time, like, where is your husband? Where are your kids? Do you have any type of thing? And you're talking about men in the DR? No, I'm talking about the girls, the ones that I worked with. Oh, really? Like the 8 to 14 year olds that I was working with. Oh, okay. Wow. All right. Yeah. They'd ask all the time. And I think it was just those things where I was like, I had to kind of take and process, and then just be like, well, this is kind of what things are right now.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.18, "text": " and this was based on a video that I saw.
