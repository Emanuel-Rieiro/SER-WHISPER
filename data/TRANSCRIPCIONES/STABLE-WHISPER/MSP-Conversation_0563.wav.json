{"text": " So please note that while I've rewritten what follows and added and subtracted elements of the story based on my own research, a lot of the info, most of the info, I would say, comes from the Charlie Project and the tireless work of Megan Good over there at the Charlie Project. So a huge thanks to her. I think that she powers a lot of these podcasts, and she is doing very tedious, difficult, but ultimately absolutely vital work. So go visit the Charlie Project, and our thanks go out to Megan Good. Thank you. And she had pierced ears. Holland had had cosmetic facial surgery in 1995, and some agencies may refer to her erroneously as Vanessa Sherry Holland. Sherry was in Flager, or Flager? I think it's Flager Beach, Florida, where she owned a vacation property, and she was preparing to return home to Atlanta, Georgia, when she was last seen between 11.30 a.m. and 12 p.m. Her sisters reported her missing when she did not arrive in Atlanta. Her vehicle, a gold or champagne-colored 1987 BMW 325i with Georgia plate BKT664, was discovered on August 24th, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, or 25th, according to some other sources. This was in 1996, and the car was discovered near exit 76 between Macon and Atlanta, Georgia. It was on I-75 northbound, located in Morrow, Georgia. It had a flat as a result of a nail that was in the front right tire. Now, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article dated August 20th, 2001, says Sherry's car was a 1985, not a 1987. So it's not really clear which year is correct. I found no definitive sort of primary sources, like police reports. It's worth noting that the same article states Sherry was last heard from on August 16th, 1995, even though GBI records and all other sources I could find state the year was 96. So, bottom line is, there may be some questions about how well the AJC article dated August 20th, 2001 was fact-checked. Just keep that in mind. Two miles from the car in Riverdale, Georgia, near the Stratford Arms apartments, Sherry's dogs were found in a field. Sadly, one of them had died after being hit by traffic, but one of them was rescued and went on to live with Sherry's twin sister, Terry. Yes, I know. A resident of the Stratford Arms told police the surviving dog, named Gracie, had tried to get him to follow her into a wooded area across the street from the apartment complex. However, further investigation revealed no evidence about Sherry in that area. There must have been other search sites, though. According to that, again, kind of dubious AJC article from 2001, as many as, quote, unquote. An anonymous tipster told investigators Sherry was seen near her car, loading luggage into a white pickup truck on the day she vanished. Further investigation revealed no additional evidence, and police could never corroborate that tip. Now, Sherry was apparently operating an escort service called Atlanta Supermodels out of her house the year she disappeared, and her business partner told investigators during an interview that the two had been in business since 1992, and he believed her murder was related to their work. The business partner spoke of Sherry in the past tense. He claimed she had set up video surveillance around the escort service's property, so I guess around the house they were running it out of, and had caught both employees and clients on video, which she later used to blackmail them. The business partner claimed to have heard many people discuss killing Sherry. Sherry had started dating a married man in 1989. The man and his wife separated briefly in 1990, but eventually got back together. Sherry and the boyfriend had planned to marry in December 1996, but the boyfriend got cold feet and stayed with his wife. Apparently, at least according to the boyfriend, his wife never knew about his affair with Sherry. The boyfriend told police he and Sherry had argued about their relationship before she left for her vacation home in Florida. Having parted ways without resolving the argument, Sherry paged him around 11.30 a.m., the day she was last heard from, and when he called her back, she told him that she would call him when she got back to Atlanta. And that was the last time he ever spoke to her, he says. Now, several people told investigators Sherry was depressed about things with this boyfriend and wanted out of the escort business. She had apparently mentioned Europe as an escape destination. Someone later gave authorities a recording of a phone call from September 1996, in which one of Sherry's sisters says to an unidentified second person that it's possible Sherry staged her own disappearance and escaped to Europe or elsewhere to start over. A forum user going by the name A New Day and claiming to have been an employee of Sherry's posted on the missing persons forum Porchlight and suspects Sherry's business partner, whom A New Day calls Jim. And this is a quote. I remember Sherry very well. She was beautiful, sweet, and had a very sophisticated air. I loved the picture of her and Gracie when Gracie was a puppy. I worked for Sherry for four years, but mostly knew her through her business partner. The whole time I worked there, she had very little to do with the business and was out of town a lot of the time. I told the GBI everything that I knew about her and her disappearance, including the fact that Jim had acted extremely nervous and sketchy during the days following her disappearance. I don't believe for one second that she was using video to blackmail her employees or their clients. If anyone did that, it was Jim. He had a whole suspicious backstory of who he was and where he came from. I'm fairly sure his name wasn't Jim, either. When he told me about her disappearance, he said she probably just wanted to leave town to get away from her life and also to make her boyfriend worry about her. It was well known that she was devastated about the relationship problems. I never trusted anything about Jim. He would say terrible things about her, but at the same time pretty much lived on her dime and the business she had started. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he had finally decided to quote unquote take the business all for himself. It was very profitable, and being that it was a under the table, he probably figured no one would take much notice. I look online year after year to see if anything has come of the case. She was, parentheses hopefully is, such a vibrant person. She positively radiated with life. I hope she is living in Europe and is finally happy. God bless you, Sherry. Unquote. Now, A New Day created their forum account on the same day they posted that message, and they never posted anything else at Porchlight. So this info should probably be taken with a shaker, a whole shaker of salt, but interesting nonetheless. Okay, on to motives for this disappearance. We'll discuss all the motives I found in my research or came up with myself to make Sherry disappear. Now, this section should probably be called suspects, but I'm not really in a position to suggest anyone is guilty of anything, so I am just reluctant to call it that. These are motives, not suspects. Wink wink. Okay, motive number one. Sherry's business partner, Jim, had a couple of possible motives. First, if the rumors are true that Sherry was blackmailing clients and employees, she could have been damaging the business, driving Jim to get rid of her to save the business. Alternatively, if Porchlight forum member A New Day is to be believed, Jim may simply have grown tired of Sherry's absentee management and decided to take the business for himself. But while A New Day claims Jim is acting, quote, extremely nervous and sketchy after Sherry disappeared, he could have been acting like that because he expected the investigation would lead authorities to his illegal escort service. That alone would be enough to be nervous about, even if Jim had had nothing to do with Sherry's disappearance. Motive number two. Sherry's married boyfriend also may have had a motive. If Sherry threatened to tell his wife about their affair, if he didn't marry Sherry like they had planned, there's no evidence she did that. I'm just posing theories. Sherry had threatened to tell his wife. Then the boyfriend may have felt his recently reconciled marriage was in danger and took the extreme step of making Sherry disappear to save his marriage. We don't even know his name, though, so it's hard to speculate on anything about his past or his personality or whether he even had the opportunity to do anything to Sherry or to hire an uninvolved third party to do it for him. Motive number three. If Sherry's boyfriend's wife had found out about the affair, despite his claims that she didn't know, her anger and jealousy may have motivated her to bring harm to Sherry herself, to demand her husband do it, or to hire an uninvolved third party to do it for them. Now, I'm going to give the GBI the benefit of the doubt here, even though I couldn't confirm it anywhere, that they talked to Sherry's boyfriend's wife. If they didn't, that's an incredibly amateurish investigative oversight. She would have told them whether or not she knew about the affair, and even if she hadn't told them one way or the other, I bet her initial reaction to the news would have demonstrated enough to investigators for them to decide whether or not she had known previously. So, these next two motives are, in my opinion, weak, but I'm including them for the sake of being thorough. So, motive number four. Sherry may have decided to escape her failed relationship and increasingly unwanted job by going to Europe, never to be heard from again. Now, the reason this is very unlikely to me is because she had no reason to abandon her car on the highway, and even less reason to abandon her dogs. She could have left the dogs with one or more of her sisters, and simply taken a cab to the airport. So, that just doesn't work for me from the very beginning. Now, related to this theory is a lead mentioned in the 2001 AJC article I mentioned earlier, and this is a quote. Then there was a man who told investigators he had gone to college in Cobb County with Holland, and recognized her on an Atlanta-bound airline flight from Texas last November. He went up and spoke to her, and the woman looked up at him and went back to reading a book. She refused to speak, GBI agent Fred May said. Unquote. Okay, now this is more total conjecture on my part, something I love to do, but I would imagine most people would politely say no or angrily say leave me alone, depending on their personality type, rather than just sort of look up at him blankly and ignore him. But annoyance may explain her refusal to speak at all, I guess. This sounds like something that may have actually happened to this woman more than once, based on her reaction. She probably looked very similar to Sherry. It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that this was Sherry. I mean, after all, why make yourself vanish to go no further than Texas, and why risk returning to Atlanta if you want so badly to get away from everyone and everything you knew? She certainly wasn't returning to reunite with friends or family, because this sighting occurred in November 2000, and she hasn't been seen by anyone that we know of since 1996. Okay, motive number five. Serial killer Gary Michael Hilton may have counted Sherry among his victims. Web Sleuths member Fig Tree theorizes that several similarities between Sherry and Hilton's victims suggest a connection. For example, Hilton told police during his confession of the January 2008 murder of Meredith Emerson that he could not bring himself to kill Emerson's dog, and had let it go a few miles from the crime scene. Also, Hilton lived 22 minutes from Sherry's Georgia residence, and had killed at least one person, Cheryl Dunlap, in Florida. Dunlap's car had been found by the side of the road with a flat tire, something Hilton had done with a knife. But Hilton confessed several murders to authorities, so why not Sherry's? I respect Fig Tree's interest in the case, and that some of them we have. Sometimes we have gut feelings that we just can't shake, but I'm just not getting that feeling here myself. I mean, I've watched, listened to, or read transcripts of, seriously, more than six hours. Of investigative interviews, and interrogations and confessions with Hilton, in an effort to give this theory my full attention. I just, I just don't see it. But if you want to dive deeper into the Hilton theory put forward by Fig Tree, you can find all the documents and the videos about Hilton himself at hiltonevidencedocuments.blogspot.com. As for my theory, I wish I had a good theory on this one, but first I'll just tell you what I think did not happen. I don't think she ran away to Europe, and I don't think she was murdered by Gary Michael Hilton. I also don't really see her boyfriend or his wife getting involved in a disappearance or a murder without drawing significant attention from investigators, and I couldn't find anything naming them as suspects or making more than a brief mention about them. It's frankly hard for me to believe a couple who could barely keep their marriage intact managed to commit the perfect murder and haven't been suspected of it during the 20 years since. Now, as for the two possibilities that look like possibilities to me. First, I do agree with Fig Tree on Web Sleuths that it could have been a killer, a serial killer. Fuqua DeWalt Cashaw was arrested at his home in Texas in February 2015 for the 1999 murder of 22-year-old Heather Danielle Davidson in Georgia. And this guy came up in the thread Fig Tree was putting forth their theory in, and the last we heard of Cashaw, he was out on bond after pleading not guilty to Davidson's strangling death. According to ClickToHouston.com, Cook County, Illinois court records show in 1990 Cashaw was found guilty of murder and second-degree murder. In 2003, he was found guilty of unlawful use of a weapon, and in 2004 he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and concealment of a homicidal death. So he's got both prior convictions and present charges that indicate he's capable of murder. And Davidson's body was found on a small and desolate stretch of Georgia road by a passerby, by accident. Now, a tendency to take victims somewhere out of the way isn't something every serial killer does. Right, we all know, for example, John Wayne Gacy just stuck him under the floorboards at his house. But a tendency to take victims somewhere out of the way may explain why no sign of Sherry has been found at any of the leads uncovered by investigators. Because they were all derived from some connection to Sherry, like where her car was found or where her dogs were found. A Fox 5 article quotes Lieutenant Darrell Powers of the Butts County Sheriff's Office as saying, Through the evidence that we recovered and the witnesses we've interviewed, we believe that there are possible other victims of Cashaw out there. So that prompts me to keep this theory on the table, however tenuous I do think it probably is. My second theory is that Sherry got a flat tire heading home from Florida to Georgia, and an assailant kidnapped or murdered her in a crime of opportunity. This one is admittedly not as compelling as the Cashaw theory, but unfortunately, at least in my opinion, it's at least as plausible. That's all I have on Sherry Vanessa Holland. If you have any information at all relating to the disappearance of Sherry Vanessa Holland, however minuscule, however pointless, you saw her in a gas station the day she was last seen, anything,

elements of the story based on my own research, a lot of the info, most of the info, I would say, comes from the Charlie Project and the tireless work of Megan Good over there at the Charlie Project. So a huge thanks to her. I think that she powers a lot of these podcasts, and she is doing very tedious, difficult, but ultimately absolutely vital work. So go visit the Charlie Project, and our thanks go out to Megan Good. Thank you. And she had pierced ears. Holland had had cosmetic facial surgery in 1995, and some agencies may refer to her erroneously as Vanessa Sherry Holland. Sherry was in Flager, or Flager? I think it's Flager Beach, Florida, where she owned a vacation property, and she was preparing to return home to Atlanta, Georgia, when she was last seen between 11.30 a.m. and 12 p.m. Her sisters reported her missing when she did not arrive in Atlanta. Her vehicle, a gold or champagne-colored 1987 BMW 325i with Georgia plate BKT664, was discovered on August 24th, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, or 25th, according to some other sources. This was in 1996, and the car was discovered near exit 76 between Macon and Atlanta, Georgia. It was on I-75 northbound, located in Morrow, Georgia. It had a flat as a result of a nail that was in the front right tire. Now, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article dated August 20th, 2001, says Sherry's car was a 1985, not a 1987. So it's not really clear which year is correct. I found no definitive sort of primary sources, like police reports. It's worth noting that the same article states Sherry was last heard from on August 16th, 1995, even though GBI records and all other sources I could find state the year was 96. So, bottom line is, there may be some questions about how well the AJC article dated August 20th, 2001 was fact-checked. Just keep that in mind. Two miles from the car in Riverdale, Georgia, near the Stratford Arms apartments, Sherry's dogs were found in a field. Sadly, one of them had died after being hit by traffic, but one of them was rescued and went on to live with Sherry's twin sister, Terry. Yes, I know. A resident of the Stratford Arms told police the surviving dog, named Gracie, had tried to get him to follow her into a wooded area across the street from the apartment complex. However, further investigation revealed no evidence about Sherry in that area. There must have been other search sites, though. According to that, again, kind of dubious AJC article from 2001, as many as, quote, unquote. An anonymous tipster told investigators Sherry was seen near her car, loading luggage into a white pickup truck on the day she vanished. Further investigation revealed no additional evidence, and police could never corroborate that tip. Now, Sherry was apparently operating an escort service called Atlanta Supermodels out of her house the year she disappeared, and her business partner told investigators during an interview that the two had been in business since 1992, and he believed her murder was related to their work. The business partner spoke of Sherry in the past tense. He claimed she had set up video surveillance around the escort service's property, so I guess around the house they were running it out of, and had caught both employees and clients on video, which she later used to blackmail them. The business partner claimed to have heard many people discuss killing Sherry. Sherry had started dating a married man in 1989. The man and his wife separated briefly in 1990, but eventually got back together. Sherry and the boyfriend had planned to marry in December 1996, but the boyfriend got cold feet and stayed with his wife. Apparently, at least according to the boyfriend, his wife never knew about his affair with Sherry. The boyfriend told police he and Sherry had argued about their relationship before she left for her vacation home in Florida. Having parted ways without resolving the argument, Sherry paged him around 11.30 a.m., the day she was last heard from, and when he called her back, she told him that she would call him when she got back to Atlanta. And that was the last time he ever spoke to her, he says. Now, several people told investigators Sherry was depressed about things with this boyfriend and wanted out of the escort business. She had apparently mentioned Europe as an escape destination. Someone later gave authorities a recording of a phone call from September 1996, in which one of Sherry's sisters says to an unidentified second person that it's possible Sherry staged her own disappearance and escaped to Europe or elsewhere to start over. A forum user going by the name A New Day and claiming to have been an employee of Sherry's posted on the missing persons forum Porchlight and suspects Sherry's business partner, whom A New Day calls Jim. And this is a quote. I remember Sherry very well. She was beautiful, sweet, and had a very sophisticated air. I loved the picture of her and Gracie when Gracie was a puppy. I worked for Sherry for four years, but mostly knew her through her business partner. The whole time I worked there, she had very little to do with the business and was out of town a lot of the time. I told the GBI everything that I knew about her and her disappearance, including the fact that Jim had acted extremely nervous and sketchy during the days following her disappearance. I don't believe for one second that she was using video to blackmail her employees or their clients. If anyone did that, it was Jim. He had a whole suspicious backstory of who he was and where he came from. I'm fairly sure his name wasn't Jim, either. When he told me about her disappearance, he said she probably just wanted to leave town to get away from her life and also to make her boyfriend worry about her. It was well known that she was devastated about the relationship problems. I never trusted anything about Jim. He would say terrible things about her, but at the same time pretty much lived on her dime and the business she had started. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he had finally decided to quote unquote take the business all for himself. It was very profitable, and being that it was a under the table, he probably figured no one would take much notice. I look online year after year to see if anything has come of the case. She was, parentheses hopefully is, such a vibrant person. She positively radiated with life. I hope she is living in Europe and is finally happy. God bless you, Sherry. Unquote. Now, A New Day created their forum account on the same day they posted that message, and they never posted anything else at Porchlight. So this info should probably be taken with a shaker, a whole shaker of salt, but interesting nonetheless. Okay, on to motives for this disappearance. We'll discuss all the motives I found in my research or came up with myself to make Sherry disappear. Now, this section should probably be called suspects, but I'm not really in a position to suggest anyone is guilty of anything, so I am just reluctant to call it that. These are motives, not suspects. Wink wink. Okay, motive number one. Sherry's business partner, Jim, had a couple of possible motives. First, if the rumors are true that Sherry was blackmailing clients and employees, she could have been damaging the business, driving Jim to get rid of her to save the business. Alternatively, if Porchlight forum member A New Day is to be believed, Jim may simply have grown tired of Sherry's absentee management and decided to take the business for himself. But while A New Day claims Jim is acting, quote, extremely nervous and sketchy after Sherry disappeared, he could have been acting like that because he expected the investigation would lead authorities to his illegal escort service. That alone would be enough to be nervous about, even if Jim had had nothing to do with Sherry's disappearance. Motive number two. Sherry's married boyfriend also may have had a motive. If Sherry threatened to tell his wife about their affair, if he didn't marry Sherry like they had planned, there's no evidence she did that. I'm just posing theories. Sherry had threatened to tell his wife. Then the boyfriend may have felt his recently reconciled marriage was in danger and took the extreme step of making Sherry disappear to save his marriage. We don't even know his name, though, so it's hard to speculate on anything about his past or his personality or whether he even had the opportunity to do anything to Sherry or to hire an uninvolved third party to do it for him. Motive number three. If Sherry's boyfriend's wife had found out about the affair, despite his claims that she didn't know, her anger and jealousy may have motivated her to bring harm to Sherry herself, to demand her husband do it, or to hire an uninvolved third party to do it for them. Now, I'm going to give the GBI the benefit of the doubt here, even though I couldn't confirm it anywhere, that they talked to Sherry's boyfriend's wife. If they didn't, that's an incredibly amateurish investigative oversight. She would have told them whether or not she knew about the affair, and even if she hadn't told them one way or the other, I bet her initial reaction to the news would have demonstrated enough to investigators for them to decide whether or not she had known previously. So, these next two motives are, in my opinion, weak, but I'm including them for the sake of being thorough. So, motive number four. Sherry may have decided to escape her failed relationship and increasingly unwanted job by going to Europe, never to be heard from again. Now, the reason this is very unlikely to me is because she had no reason to abandon her car on the highway, and even less reason to abandon her dogs. She could have left the dogs with one or more of her sisters, and simply taken a cab to the airport. So, that just doesn't work for me from the very beginning. Now, related to this theory is a lead mentioned in the 2001 AJC article I mentioned earlier, and this is a quote. Then there was a man who told investigators he had gone to college in Cobb County with Holland, and recognized her on an Atlanta-bound airline flight from Texas last November. He went up and spoke to her, and the woman looked up at him and went back to reading a book. She refused to speak, GBI agent Fred May said. Unquote. Okay, now this is more total conjecture on my part, something I love to do, but I would imagine most people would politely say no or angrily say leave me alone, depending on their personality type, rather than just sort of look up at him blankly and ignore him. But annoyance may explain her refusal to speak at all, I guess. This sounds like something that may have actually happened to this woman more than once, based on her reaction. She probably looked very similar to Sherry. It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that this was Sherry. I mean, after all, why make yourself vanish to go no further than Texas, and why risk returning to Atlanta if you want so badly to get away from everyone and everything you knew? She certainly wasn't returning to reunite with friends or family, because this sighting occurred in November 2000, and she hasn't been seen by anyone that we know of since 1996. Okay, motive number five. Serial killer Gary Michael Hilton may have counted Sherry among his victims. Web Sleuths member Fig Tree theorizes that several similarities between Sherry and Hilton's victims suggest a connection. For example, Hilton told police during his confession of the January 2008 murder of Meredith Emerson that he could not bring himself to kill Emerson's dog, and had let it go a few miles from the crime scene. Also, Hilton lived 22 minutes from Sherry's Georgia residence, and had killed at least one person, Cheryl Dunlap, in Florida. Dunlap's car had been found by the side of the road with a flat tire, something Hilton had done with a knife. But Hilton confessed several murders to authorities, so why not Sherry's? I respect Fig Tree's interest in the case, and that some of them we have. Sometimes we have gut feelings that we just can't shake, but I'm just not getting that feeling here myself. I mean, I've watched, listened to, or read transcripts of, seriously, more than six hours. Of investigative interviews, and interrogations and confessions with Hilton, in an effort to give this theory my full attention. I just, I just don't see it. But if you want to dive deeper into the Hilton theory put forward by Fig Tree, you can find all the documents and the videos about Hilton himself at hiltonevidencedocuments.blogspot.com. As for my theory, I wish I had a good theory on this one, but first I'll just tell you what I think did not happen. I don't think she ran away to Europe, and I don't think she was murdered by Gary Michael Hilton. I also don't really see her boyfriend or his wife getting involved in a disappearance or a murder without drawing significant attention from investigators, and I couldn't find anything naming them as suspects or making more than a brief mention about them. It's frankly hard for me to believe a couple who could barely keep their marriage intact managed to commit the perfect murder and haven't been suspected of it during the 20 years since. Now, as for the two possibilities that look like possibilities to me. First, I do agree with Fig Tree on Web Sleuths that it could have been a killer, a serial killer. Fuqua DeWalt Cashaw was arrested at his home in Texas in February 2015 for the 1999 murder of 22-year-old Heather Danielle Davidson in Georgia. And this guy came up in the thread Fig Tree was putting forth their theory in, and the last we heard of Cashaw, he was out on bond after pleading not guilty to Davidson's strangling death. According to ClickToHouston.com, Cook County, Illinois court records show in 1990 Cashaw was found guilty of murder and second-degree murder. In 2003, he was found guilty of unlawful use of a weapon, and in 2004 he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and concealment of a homicidal death. So he's got both prior convictions and present charges that indicate he's capable of murder. And Davidson's body was found on a small and desolate stretch of Georgia road by a passerby, by accident. Now, a tendency to take victims somewhere out of the way isn't something every serial killer does. Right, we all know, for example, John Wayne Gacy just stuck him under the floorboards at his house. But a tendency to take victims somewhere out of the way may explain why no sign of Sherry has been found at any of the leads uncovered by investigators. Because they were all derived from some connection to Sherry, like where her car was found or where her dogs were found. A Fox 5 article quotes Lieutenant Darrell Powers of the Butts County Sheriff's Office as saying, Through the evidence that we recovered and the witnesses we've interviewed, we believe that there are possible other victims of Cashaw out there. So that prompts me to keep this theory on the table, however tenuous I do think it probably is. My second theory is that Sherry got a flat tire heading home from Florida to Georgia, and an assailant kidnapped or murdered her in a crime of opportunity. This one is admittedly not as compelling as the Cashaw theory, but unfortunately, at least in my opinion, it's at least as plausible. That's all I have on Sherry Vanessa Holland.
