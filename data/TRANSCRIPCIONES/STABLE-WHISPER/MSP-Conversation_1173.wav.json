{"text": " So tonight we have four writers who are going to, well I guess you'll find out, but talk about the connections or not between writing and politics. I'm just going to introduce them very briefly. They all come at it from very different histories and backstories. Immediately on my right is Owen Hill. For his sins he's a poet, but he's written several novels as well, some of which are really good. On his right is Barry Eisler, who comes from a background of originally worked for the CIA for several years, and is a best-selling novelist who writes about various protagonists going through various turmoils. In his thrillers, on his right is Summer Brenner, another poet and novelist. And at the end we have Michael Harris, who's a Vietnam vet and was a reporter, a newspaper man, for many years. Owen is going to kind of moderate the discussion and keep it going, but I think beyond that I'll let these guys talk for themselves. Thank you. Thank you, Ramsey. So I'll get it started. Something I've been losing sleep over. After BoucherCon, a bunch of us went to BoucherCon, and I went to a discussion that was really interesting that Barry was a part of, and David Corbett was one of my favorite authors, and it was a very full house. You know, BoucherCon is this mystery convention that hundreds of thousands of mystery fans and writers come to every year. And it was a really interesting discussion, but it was mainstream. It was conservative-slash-liberal and Democrat-Republican, and it didn't get too far outside that. It didn't get into, except when Barry mentioned the torture issue, it didn't get into issues or political philosophy beyond the mainstream. At least 70% of the people in that large audience would think of me as a total nut, part of the radical fringe. And I don't want to speak for you all, but what do we do as part of the radical fringe to try to gain the kind of audience that will have some sort of political power, and what kind of writing works that way? I don't want to suggest one question by this. I want to bounce that off of you all since it's been bugging me. Should we start at the end and come down? Well, I didn't start out to write a book about politics, but the politics sort of came into it as I went. My protagonist in this is a Vietnam vet who has, who's sort of going through life with two strikes against him. He stutters badly and he is very depressed and guilty, and because of the stuttering he can't hide the fact that he is depressed and guilty. And so, he, two things come from this. One of them is that he sort of instinctively seeks out other misfits and losers and steers away from the fat and complacent people of the world. And so, gets to know people he wouldn't ordinarily meet and begins to get some sense of what's happening in society. And the second thing is that because of his disability, he knows he's not the sort who is going to succeed in cutthroat capitalist competition. He, you know, he identifies with the underdog. He sees that oftentimes underdogs are underdogs for reasons that aren't their fault. So, and the climax of the book involves the riots in 1992 in Los Angeles. And the point isn't to judge them as good or bad, but to show them as the pretty much inevitable outgrowth of the way a lot of the characters live. Well, I grew up in Georgia some decades ago, and it was an apartheid world. And as a child, the world was very polarized. And as, I mean, a very young girl, I was very aware of the polarizations that were around me. And I certainly felt that there was a kind of evil that permeated the atmosphere where I lived. Not literally where I lived, because I lived in a relative world of privilege. But I grew up in a world of privilege. I grew up in a home where the issues, the very pressing and profound issues of this subject were discussed regularly. And so, I guess, sort of justice and not necessarily black and white, because I think that the, the world of, of the moral world is more nuanced than just the two extremes. But I was suckered on this sense of that there's justice. And when I began to write crime fiction, and I write other kinds of fiction and other kinds of writing as well, I, you know, I was very drawn to creating characters that deliberately exploit, deliberately use and abuse. And, and, and, and what kind of motivates these scenarios in the world. And, and this book, I-5, that PM has published, I-5 being for Interstate 5, it's about sex trafficking. So, you know, sex trafficking to me is the ultimate exploitation, and in a certain way, the ultimate logic of a capitalist system. How do we make what is today considered radical more mainstream? It's a very good question. I think everybody has to do it in his or her own way. What I try to do in my novels is to depict things which I don't actually think are radical at all, but in fact, just the way things really are. And I hope that when people read the stories, they'll take a fresh look at whatever it is I've depicted. One thing that comes to mind in this regard is what I call an oligarchy. And I didn't invent the use of the word with regard to the collection of interests that rules America today. Actually, I first came across this term in an Atlantic, in an Atlantic Monthly article by former MIT economist and now, I'm sorry, IMF economist and now MIT professor, Simon Johnson. It's called The Quiet Coup. I really recommend it. Just Google it. The Quiet Coup, Simon Johnson. And he describes this collection of interests that governs America as an oligarchy. And to me, it's indisputable. It's a word we don't usually use with regard to America. More likely, we'll use it with regard to the old Soviet Union or maybe Russia. Plutocracy is another word that we're not comfortable using with regard to what we find in America. And it's a shame because actually, this collection of media, military, political, and corporate interests that is better able to protect its interests through cooperation than it would be by competition is just a classic oligarchy. And our avoidance of the word with regard to our own system, I think, obscures its existence in America. We have lots of words like this, by the way. And I guess this is one of the things I try to do in my books and also on my blog is to use words that we typically use exclusively for others, exclusively to denigrate others. I try to use them for ourselves. So for example, we don't torture. We use enhanced interrogation techniques. We don't have tribes, but we have factions. We don't have an oligarchy. We have an establishment. These all really mean, all these words and phrases mean pretty much the same thing. We don't have secret prisons. We have detention centers. We don't have a gulag, certainly. We have detention centers. And I think if you start using these words that are typically reserved for other countries and cultures, using them accurately with respect to what we find here at home, you can get people, some people anyway, to look at these phenomena with a new set of eyes. At least that's what I try to do. Well, I guess I should answer my own question or try. Having been a mystery fan for so long, I just wanted to write one for fun. But I had hoped that it was sort of a way to do something subversive to sort of lull people into having a good time. And I try to use humor a lot and hopefully slyly get something over. But for that, you have to find a mainstream audience. So I'm not sure how to deal with that. I've done that a little bit in this book, Incredible Devil. I'd like to get us talking about audience because I've just been thinking about it a lot since Batchicon. And also, like Summer and I did, I don't know, 600 readings together or so. So we got to see our audience sometimes three at a time, which is fine, which is fine. But for example, we did an anarchist book for it. We were in San Francisco, which was pretty great. It's always really great. But the sense I got talking to people and because the attendance was always a little less for fiction than it was for nonfiction was that I don't know that people who, what do you call it, who are on the left or especially young kids who are very political understand that genre fiction can have some sort of a political power. And I don't know what to do with that. I mean, what do we do to find that audience? I think it's out there. But I don't know if we're getting to them. Is that your sense that the anarchist books for it? I mean, all these really political sized interesting kids, but I don't think they read fiction and very little genre fiction. Well, I think that, I mean, those of us, of course, who write fiction, read fiction and love fiction, you know, are baffled by the fact that there's some segment, I think, of the population, maybe left wing, maybe of a certain age that doesn't think that fiction is as serious or as informative. And I think it is a kind of misguided notion. I mean, because fiction can actually give you the interiority of an experience that nonfiction really doesn't deliver. But how you bring those... those populations to your readership, I mean, I'm constantly scratching my head about that because, I mean, marketing budgets can do that to a certain degree, I guess. And maybe Barry will speak to that. But I don't have an answer. I think it's not that hard, actually. You just put lots of sex and violence in your books. And then people will read them. And you can also have these serious themes that they'll get exposed to, too. Well, this is a book that is all about sex and violence. It's a book about sex trafficking. But when a New York agent tried to sell it, typically the editor's responses were, it was too disturbing. I considered it a compliment. I mean, why would you write a book about sex trafficking that wasn't really disturbing? So, you know, there's this sort of... There's sex and then there's sexiness. And sexiness is kind of something else. You know, it has a kind of gloss. And this is very... You know, it's a kind of a... It's a raw and really stripped down kind of a... You know, there's no gloss. Well, for a book like this, it's a challenge. But I always believe it can be done. I mean, if a book like The Lovely Bones, which is about the murder of a teenage girl, can become the runaway bestseller it was, I'm optimistic that anything can be positioned right. It's not necessarily easy. It's going to be easier for some books. And it is for others. But there's got to be a way. You have to find a person who's got the vision. It's an important topic, for example. So, it is disturbing. So, most people will try to steer clear of it. But somebody will take it. I mean, Larry McMurtry's first book... Or not first book. His book, Lonesome Dove. Pulitzer Prize winner. I don't know if anyone here has read it. It's just... It's one of the best books ever written. It's a fantastic book. Well, his agent couldn't sell it. Because editor after editor said, nobody's reading Westerns anymore. Western's dead. Who wants this doorstop Western? Go away. Well, the rest is history, of course. But so... Well, Interview with a Vampire has the same history. Oh, is that right? Yeah. 36 Rejections. Oh, my God. Nobody wants to read a book about New Orleans vampires. There you go. And so Anne Rice is now such a creative... So, those are very sort of exceptional kind of stories that we, I don't know, sort of hold on to as some lodestar. I'd like to know why you all chose genre writing rather than, say, literary fiction. I know you do other things, too. But what made you write in this form? I'm smiling because I have a friend who answers that question by saying, because I like plots. Well, that's a good answer, actually. Well, I didn't set out to do a genre novel. I was thinking about the earlier question about the audience. I have a 23-year-old son. And so just by sort of checking in with him from time to time, I can get some news from that front. And they do seem to read quite a bit of fiction, but it's fantasy and sci-fi. There may be politics in it, but I mean, I do have the feeling sometimes that its purpose is to get people to escape from all of the real problems into these imaginary ones. But maybe that's just an old fart, complaining. The writers who initially inspired me to start writing long, long ago, a lot of those were either writers or writers of the Russians of the late 19th century or Americans or Brits of the early 20th who were often intensely political. And so it seemed pretty natural to me that politics and fiction should go together. If you read Tolstoy, for example, I mean, my God, he's trying to upend everything. So, but in this book, The Chuhoy Saloon, I was just trying to show a kind of outsider consciousness that I didn't think had been rendered in American literature at least in the last 150 years. That whenever you can get an outsider consciousness, there is an implied critique of the way things are. Yeah, I do too. I just wanted to make a comment on your 19th century Russian, you know, reading and a passion for that literature, which I share as well. But fiction was actually the only medium that could get through the censors. So all the ideological conversations that were happening in 19th century Russia were actually happening through the novels. And so, I mean, it's a fascinating history. But, you know, I mean, the power of politics really was in fiction writing. And we're not entirely disconnected from that. But, of course, the debates have been so diluted. I really liked your commentary about, you know, language and how you're utilizing language. And one word you didn't mention, though, was terrorism and, you know, our homegrown terrorism and our, you know, what that really even means, terrorism. I mean, the terrorism of the corporate state is, I mean, these are words that need to be more in currency too. Well, I didn't say terrorism just because it doesn't have an obvious analog, if you know what I mean. Like, you've got tribes and factions, terrorists and, I mean, freedom fighters is the one that people usually use. But we don't talk about our freedom fighters. It's just, I mean, basically our definition of terrorism is it's something that brown-skinned, mostly Muslim people do. And that's it. It's what Islamic people do. And what we do is not terrorism, but we don't have a word for it. Peacekeeping, I guess we sometimes call it. But the Oklahoma City bombing was, you know, I mean, there was a moment in our history where that was, you know, that was the word that was being used. Yeah, it was clearly terrorism.

out, but talk about the connections or not between writing and politics. I'm just going to introduce them very briefly. They all come at it from very different histories and backstories. Immediately on my right is Owen Hill. For his sins he's a poet, but he's written several novels as well, some of which are really good. On his right is Barry Eisler, who comes from a background of originally worked for the CIA for several years, and is a best-selling novelist who writes about various protagonists going through various turmoils. In his thrillers, on his right is Summer Brenner, another poet and novelist. And at the end we have Michael Harris, who's a Vietnam vet and was a reporter, a newspaper man, for many years. Owen is going to kind of moderate the discussion and keep it going, but I think beyond that I'll let these guys talk for themselves. Thank you. Thank you, Ramsey. So I'll get it started. Something I've been losing sleep over. After BoucherCon, a bunch of us went to BoucherCon, and I went to a discussion that was really interesting that Barry was a part of, and David Corbett was one of my favorite authors, and it was a very full house. You know, BoucherCon is this mystery convention that hundreds of thousands of mystery fans and writers come to every year. And it was a really interesting discussion, but it was mainstream. It was conservative-slash-liberal and Democrat-Republican, and it didn't get too far outside that. It didn't get into, except when Barry mentioned the torture issue, it didn't get into issues or political philosophy beyond the mainstream. At least 70% of the people in that large audience would think of me as a total nut, part of the radical fringe. And I don't want to speak for you all, but what do we do as part of the radical fringe to try to gain the kind of audience that will have some sort of political power, and what kind of writing works that way? I don't want to suggest one question by this. I want to bounce that off of you all since it's been bugging me. Should we start at the end and come down? Well, I didn't start out to write a book about politics, but the politics sort of came into it as I went. My protagonist in this is a Vietnam vet who has, who's sort of going through life with two strikes against him. He stutters badly and he is very depressed and guilty, and because of the stuttering he can't hide the fact that he is depressed and guilty. And so, he, two things come from this. One of them is that he sort of instinctively seeks out other misfits and losers and steers away from the fat and complacent people of the world. And so, gets to know people he wouldn't ordinarily meet and begins to get some sense of what's happening in society. And the second thing is that because of his disability, he knows he's not the sort who is going to succeed in cutthroat capitalist competition. He, you know, he identifies with the underdog. He sees that oftentimes underdogs are underdogs for reasons that aren't their fault. So, and the climax of the book involves the riots in 1992 in Los Angeles. And the point isn't to judge them as good or bad, but to show them as the pretty much inevitable outgrowth of the way a lot of the characters live. Well, I grew up in Georgia some decades ago, and it was an apartheid world. And as a child, the world was very polarized. And as, I mean, a very young girl, I was very aware of the polarizations that were around me. And I certainly felt that there was a kind of evil that permeated the atmosphere where I lived. Not literally where I lived, because I lived in a relative world of privilege. But I grew up in a world of privilege. I grew up in a home where the issues, the very pressing and profound issues of this subject were discussed regularly. And so, I guess, sort of justice and not necessarily black and white, because I think that the, the world of, of the moral world is more nuanced than just the two extremes. But I was suckered on this sense of that there's justice. And when I began to write crime fiction, and I write other kinds of fiction and other kinds of writing as well, I, you know, I was very drawn to creating characters that deliberately exploit, deliberately use and abuse. And, and, and, and what kind of motivates these scenarios in the world. And, and this book, I-5, that PM has published, I-5 being for Interstate 5, it's about sex trafficking. So, you know, sex trafficking to me is the ultimate exploitation, and in a certain way, the ultimate logic of a capitalist system. How do we make what is today considered radical more mainstream? It's a very good question. I think everybody has to do it in his or her own way. What I try to do in my novels is to depict things which I don't actually think are radical at all, but in fact, just the way things really are. And I hope that when people read the stories, they'll take a fresh look at whatever it is I've depicted. One thing that comes to mind in this regard is what I call an oligarchy. And I didn't invent the use of the word with regard to the collection of interests that rules America today. Actually, I first came across this term in an Atlantic, in an Atlantic Monthly article by former MIT economist and now, I'm sorry, IMF economist and now MIT professor, Simon Johnson. It's called The Quiet Coup. I really recommend it. Just Google it. The Quiet Coup, Simon Johnson. And he describes this collection of interests that governs America as an oligarchy. And to me, it's indisputable. It's a word we don't usually use with regard to America. More likely, we'll use it with regard to the old Soviet Union or maybe Russia. Plutocracy is another word that we're not comfortable using with regard to what we find in America. And it's a shame because actually, this collection of media, military, political, and corporate interests that is better able to protect its interests through cooperation than it would be by competition is just a classic oligarchy. And our avoidance of the word with regard to our own system, I think, obscures its existence in America. We have lots of words like this, by the way. And I guess this is one of the things I try to do in my books and also on my blog is to use words that we typically use exclusively for others, exclusively to denigrate others. I try to use them for ourselves. So for example, we don't torture. We use enhanced interrogation techniques. We don't have tribes, but we have factions. We don't have an oligarchy. We have an establishment. These all really mean, all these words and phrases mean pretty much the same thing. We don't have secret prisons. We have detention centers. We don't have a gulag, certainly. We have detention centers. And I think if you start using these words that are typically reserved for other countries and cultures, using them accurately with respect to what we find here at home, you can get people, some people anyway, to look at these phenomena with a new set of eyes. At least that's what I try to do. Well, I guess I should answer my own question or try. Having been a mystery fan for so long, I just wanted to write one for fun. But I had hoped that it was sort of a way to do something subversive to sort of lull people into having a good time. And I try to use humor a lot and hopefully slyly get something over. But for that, you have to find a mainstream audience. So I'm not sure how to deal with that. I've done that a little bit in this book, Incredible Devil. I'd like to get us talking about audience because I've just been thinking about it a lot since Batchicon. And also, like Summer and I did, I don't know, 600 readings together or so. So we got to see our audience sometimes three at a time, which is fine, which is fine. But for example, we did an anarchist book for it. We were in San Francisco, which was pretty great. It's always really great. But the sense I got talking to people and because the attendance was always a little less for fiction than it was for nonfiction was that I don't know that people who, what do you call it, who are on the left or especially young kids who are very political understand that genre fiction can have some sort of a political power. And I don't know what to do with that. I mean, what do we do to find that audience? I think it's out there. But I don't know if we're getting to them. Is that your sense that the anarchist books for it? I mean, all these really political sized interesting kids, but I don't think they read fiction and very little genre fiction. Well, I think that, I mean, those of us, of course, who write fiction, read fiction and love fiction, you know, are baffled by the fact that there's some segment, I think, of the population, maybe left wing, maybe of a certain age that doesn't think that fiction is as serious or as informative. And I think it is a kind of misguided notion. I mean, because fiction can actually give you the interiority of an experience that nonfiction really doesn't deliver. But how you bring those... those populations to your readership, I mean, I'm constantly scratching my head about that because, I mean, marketing budgets can do that to a certain degree, I guess. And maybe Barry will speak to that. But I don't have an answer. I think it's not that hard, actually. You just put lots of sex and violence in your books. And then people will read them. And you can also have these serious themes that they'll get exposed to, too. Well, this is a book that is all about sex and violence. It's a book about sex trafficking. But when a New York agent tried to sell it, typically the editor's responses were, it was too disturbing. I considered it a compliment. I mean, why would you write a book about sex trafficking that wasn't really disturbing? So, you know, there's this sort of... There's sex and then there's sexiness. And sexiness is kind of something else. You know, it has a kind of gloss. And this is very... You know, it's a kind of a... It's a raw and really stripped down kind of a... You know, there's no gloss. Well, for a book like this, it's a challenge. But I always believe it can be done. I mean, if a book like The Lovely Bones, which is about the murder of a teenage girl, can become the runaway bestseller it was, I'm optimistic that anything can be positioned right. It's not necessarily easy. It's going to be easier for some books. And it is for others. But there's got to be a way. You have to find a person who's got the vision. It's an important topic, for example. So, it is disturbing. So, most people will try to steer clear of it. But somebody will take it. I mean, Larry McMurtry's first book... Or not first book. His book, Lonesome Dove. Pulitzer Prize winner. I don't know if anyone here has read it. It's just... It's one of the best books ever written. It's a fantastic book. Well, his agent couldn't sell it. Because editor after editor said, nobody's reading Westerns anymore. Western's dead. Who wants this doorstop Western? Go away. Well, the rest is history, of course. But so... Well, Interview with a Vampire has the same history. Oh, is that right? Yeah. 36 Rejections. Oh, my God. Nobody wants to read a book about New Orleans vampires. There you go. And so Anne Rice is now such a creative... So, those are very sort of exceptional kind of stories that we, I don't know, sort of hold on to as some lodestar. I'd like to know why you all chose genre writing rather than, say, literary fiction. I know you do other things, too. But what made you write in this form? I'm smiling because I have a friend who answers that question by saying, because I like plots. Well, that's a good answer, actually. Well, I didn't set out to do a genre novel. I was thinking about the earlier question about the audience. I have a 23-year-old son. And so just by sort of checking in with him from time to time, I can get some news from that front. And they do seem to read quite a bit of fiction, but it's fantasy and sci-fi. There may be politics in it, but I mean, I do have the feeling sometimes that its purpose is to get people to escape from all of the real problems into these imaginary ones. But maybe that's just an old fart, complaining. The writers who initially inspired me to start writing long, long ago, a lot of those were either writers or writers of the Russians of the late 19th century or Americans or Brits of the early 20th who were often intensely political. And so it seemed pretty natural to me that politics and fiction should go together. If you read Tolstoy, for example, I mean, my God, he's trying to upend everything. So, but in this book, The Chuhoy Saloon, I was just trying to show a kind of outsider consciousness that I didn't think had been rendered in American literature at least in the last 150 years. That whenever you can get an outsider consciousness, there is an implied critique of the way things are. Yeah, I do too. I just wanted to make a comment on your 19th century Russian, you know, reading and a passion for that literature, which I share as well. But fiction was actually the only medium that could get through the censors. So all the ideological conversations that were happening in 19th century Russia were actually happening through the novels. And so, I mean, it's a fascinating history. But, you know, I mean, the power of politics really was in fiction writing. And we're not entirely disconnected from that. But, of course, the debates have been so diluted. I really liked your commentary about, you know, language and how you're utilizing language. And one word you didn't mention, though, was terrorism and, you know, our homegrown terrorism and our, you know, what that really even means, terrorism. I mean, the terrorism of the corporate state is, I mean, these are words that need to be more in currency too. Well, I didn't say terrorism just because it doesn't have an obvious analog, if you know what I mean. Like, you've got tribes and factions, terrorists and, I mean, freedom fighters is the one that people usually use. But we don't talk about our freedom fighters. It's just, I mean, basically our definition of terrorism is it's something that brown-skinned, mostly Muslim people do. And that's it. It's what Islamic people do. And what we do is not terrorism, but we don't have a word for it. Peacekeeping, I guess we sometimes call it. But the Oklahoma City bombing was, you know, I mean, there was a moment in our history where that was, you know, that was the word that was being used. Yeah, it was clearly terrorism.
