{"text": " And how old were you when you, or like how long ago did you decide to get this done? Why did you decide to get this done? I've heard about these magnets, I don't know, I think already like five years ago. But then it was still pretty experimental. And yeah, there were still some problems. So I was like, no, I'm not going to do that. And then I met this friend who had a magnet implanted, like I think that was two years ago. And she was like, yeah, it's awesome. Do it. And so I did it. Because like, I've been into this body modification stuff already. And there's no, I mean, this is like a functional body modification, something that's not just jewelry or something that just looks nice. You can actually use it for stuff. And yeah, I really like that. So like, I instantly went to the next, no, not to the next. I mean, there's only like a dozen people doing this in Germany. So I went to the next body mod artist who was doing it and got it. And I think that was, I don't know, one and a half years ago or something. So it all started one and a half years ago. And since then, you've gotten two RFID chips and two magnets over the course of time. Yeah, right. And I'm curious what I will get next. Because like the magnets and the RFID chips are, I don't know, I know that it's not, it doesn't, other people don't know that. But these are kind of pretty standard. I mean, it's no big deal. So, but that's like also, that's it when it, yeah, when it comes to these cyborg implants, there's not more. So yeah, if I want to get another thing, I have to build something myself or something. So imagine that there were like no limits and you could do anything and all the technology was out there for you. Like, what would you want to get? I think like maybe an artificial eye would be awesome. Okay. Although it should like really have a good fallback to my natural eye. I mean, yeah, let's say it would be an augmented eye because I don't, I don't want something that like when I don't have electricity or like, or there's some like, software update, then like one of my eyes is not working. That wouldn't be fun at all. So an implanted Google Glass, something like that. Yeah, something like that would be cool. But with an ad blocker. But you also said you were interested in LEDs and stuff like that. And I'm wondering, they are not that functional, right? So you are also interested in not functional. Yeah, I have to, I admit that's really just, yeah, for looking cool. Okay. But I mean, no, in an ideal world where I had like all the technology, of course, that would be censored and that stuff too. And I mean, the LEDs would light up and it would hopefully mean something. I don't know. God of the sun. Yeah. Or like, I'm happy, I'm sad or something like that. Yeah, I thought my face does that pretty good already. I needed something additional. Yeah. Is there a limit, like something you wouldn't do? Something that creeps you out? Creeps me out? No, I don't think so. But yeah, I'm, I have been thinking a lot about this. Like our body is pretty universal. I mean, like, for example, our legs, like, I mean, maybe I could have awesome artificial legs, like in this ideal world. But like, then if I was stuck on some island and then I would rather have my natural legs because I think I don't want to start having to fix my legs and having to debug the software of my legs and so on. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't give away any of my functional body parts to get artificial ones. But you could use artificial ones that are more specialized in certain things, right? Yeah. I mean, that's already happening, like in prosthetics. Like if you, there are some people, I think, yeah, one is called Yu He, you should actually totally Google him. He builds awesome artificial legs and he has, of course, he climbs a lot and he has legs for climbing that are like, really, really, really, really long and light and good for climbing. And of course, he also has legs for running and so on. But I know none of these are really as universal as our legs are. Yeah. Yeah. But then there are other fields you could enhance, for example, another sense or something like that. Yeah. So what, what could we possibly, possibly, do in that area? So you have this magnetic field detection or the... And there's also people who are trying to see ultraviolet light. Oh, nice. And actually, they are trying to do this by changing their diet. What? This is kind of a study they are doing. Yeah, because I forgot what it was. Some vitamin or something, vitamin. They are, they, I don't know. If they, if you change your diet, you can see ultraviolet light? What? No, that's the theory. Okay. But it's, it's probably, I'm afraid it's probably wrong that they are trying that. Okay. That would be cool though, yeah, if you could see like other colors or something like that. That would be incredible. Infrared, ultraviolet, they're both really interesting. I actually have an acquaintance who has cochlear implants, like for hearing, and he wants to be able to hear ultrasound. Like he wants to be able to hear beds. So yeah, he, he built some, something where he can hear this and plugs it into his cochlear implants. So it actually works. Yeah, I think I, I haven't, I have not, I'm not up to date with like the state of this project, but last time I heard it kind of works, but he wants to, but now he has to plug something in. So he wants to hack these implants to do that for him. And that's, that's kind of funny. I don't know how useful it is because I don't know what things beds have to tell, but. I guess it depends on your field of study. If you're like a bad expert, then it would help to. Yeah, you can find them more easily. Yeah. Yeah. But you could also like sit outside in the evening with your glass of wine and be like, damn beds. Like, can't they like stop screaming? Yeah. You'd think it might be, again, I think that like some of this stuff just might be kind of annoying. Cause maybe just cause I'm not used to it. Like you just have to sort of become accustomed to it. It's just, it's just a clicking noise, right? I think it's just clicking. I can't hear them. Yeah. I think it was just clicking. Oh, because they use it to navigate. Yeah. Yeah. So they, okay. Yeah. They do this click noises and then they listen to what comes back from the walls and stuff and then can try to navigate through the rooms. Echo location. Yeah. That's the word for that. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, it is pretty awesome that you would like go somewhere and be like, oh, there are beds around here and everybody around you would be like, how do you know that? Yeah. That'd be really cool. Yeah. But for, for someone who doesn't know what a cochlear implant is, what's a cochlear implant? I should have explained that. Like, yeah, it's an implant where like one part is in your ear. And the other half is like sits on the, on the outside of your head. And for some people who, who are deaf, it makes them hear. Yeah. And yeah, it's, I think they are also pretty advanced by now. Like you can plug in your iPhone and listen to music without using headphones. And some have, have Bluetooth already. Yeah. And you, and a little remote where you could like change the programs to, I don't know, to noisy room or to, or just switch it off. So yeah. And that's, I think that's really cyborg-y because it's really active technology in your head. I mean, they have to like remove part of your bone there to, to put it in. So that's not something that you would do at your local. Hopefully not. I just asked my piercer, but I think she would decline. Yeah. She hasn't even got a bone saw. Yeah, but that's really cyborg-y. So you have this technology inside your head that improves your hearing. Otherwise you wouldn't hear at all. And, and basically you have a computer outside of your head that can put signals into that. So the interesting thing is that you can improve your hearing in a lot of ways. You can have, you can add Bluetooth to the thing. So you can just put your phone in your pocket and listen to the music from your phone without headphones and stuff like that. That's really interesting. So you, you can just walk through the street and listen to music really, really loud and nobody sees actually why you're nicking your head or something like that. So what about when it comes to safety and stuff like that? Can you destroy your credit cards with your magnets and your hands? No, they are, they are too weak to do that. Yeah, fortunately. So, yeah, no, I think I've heard that you can like destroy your credit card with the, the magnets you have sometimes like in, in handbags, like for closing them. Oh. But I think that already sounds kind of strange to me because I think the magnet would have to be really strong. Yeah. But no, it doesn't work. And what about the hospital? Ah, yeah, there's this one thing about when you need to get an MRI, then that might be a problem because, I mean, usually you can't go in there with anything that's magnetic, right? Yeah. So, but there's one guy who did it and who, who had a magnet in his hand and he said, yeah, it's, it kind of felt hot and it moved and it was not exactly a nice feeling, but he was alive and it wasn't ripped out. But other people, but other people say it might be ripped out. And, yeah. So a friend of mine had to have his magnet removed. Yeah. Because of that. But, yeah, I mean, I will just think about that when, yeah, this happens and then I will be like, I'm sorry guys, before you can stick me in there, you have to cut this thing out. But I'm sure that's normal anyway. Like if people have like pins in their knee or something, I mean, all kinds of people have metal in their bodies these days. Artificial hips and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean, usually these are not ferromagnetic, right? Oh, maybe if they're really old, but I think the new stuff is all Titan or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. But yeah, usually the people at the hospital should be able to tell you. I mean, they might be like, you have what? Yeah. Would actually be, I'm actually kind of excited to like one day see the faces of. Yeah, but that's the only thing in a hospital that could be not that safe, right? Yeah. As far as I know. Yeah. And what about at the airport going through airport security and stuff like that? That doesn't do anything either. And I think like you've got, I think you already have like a other small parts of metal in like in your jeans. And also you can go through these metal detector things with like one cent in your pocket. Yeah. And I actually also went through some of this, like this tetrahertz scanner. What is it called? Body scanner thing recently. And they didn't see anything. It was kind of disappointing. So I have a friend who is pierced a lot and he's he always removes all his piercings before flying because of this metal detector stuff. That must be so annoying to do though. Yeah, that's really annoying. Like when you say a lot, like approximately how many? A lot. Okay. It's in the, I think it's, it's clearly about 50, I think nearly 100. But I think it's also about the individual size because like the usual small rings, they can't detect that. But like, you have these awesome bigger rings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And of course, then you don't want to like explain. Various sizes. Okay. But the magnets are too small for the detectors? Yeah. Okay. But I'm, I'm curious how this will be if I ever get anything else, like lots of the LED thing because I mean, maybe then they will be like, is this a bomb? I would be like, are you stupid? Carrying a bomb like that? But yeah, that might become a problem later, but it's not a problem right now. You'd have to have like a note from your piercer or something explaining what's going on. Yeah. But I don't know if that would like impress security. I don't know. So if someone wants to find out more about the cyborg community and how to go about doing this, what sort of things should they look for on the internet? Here in Berlin, there is a group of people who actually founded like what's called a Verein in Germany, like about the whole cyborg stuff. And they meet regularly, I think every second Monday at Seabase. So that's one thing. And the website is called, I mean, it's cyborgs.cc. So there's some info on there. And if you like want to meet real people, I'm not there regularly, but yeah. And I don't know. I have a like a micro site about this magnetic implant stuff, but it's just in German. Yeah. It's magnetimplantat.de. Okay. So that's your website. Yeah. And other than that, you should just Google for magnetic implant and then ignore all the search results that are about like dental magnetic implants, because obviously that exists too.", "segments":

this done? Why did you decide to get this done? I've heard about these magnets, I don't know, I think already like five years ago. But then it was still pretty experimental. And yeah, there were still some problems. So I was like, no, I'm not going to do that. And then I met this friend who had a magnet implanted, like I think that was two years ago. And she was like, yeah, it's awesome. Do it. And so I did it. Because like, I've been into this body modification stuff already. And there's no, I mean, this is like a functional body modification, something that's not just jewelry or something that just looks nice. You can actually use it for stuff. And yeah, I really like that. So like, I instantly went to the next, no, not to the next. I mean, there's only like a dozen people doing this in Germany. So I went to the next body mod artist who was doing it and got it. And I think that was, I don't know, one and a half years ago or something. So it all started one and a half years ago. And since then, you've gotten two RFID chips and two magnets over the course of time. Yeah, right. And I'm curious what I will get next. Because like the magnets and the RFID chips are, I don't know, I know that it's not, it doesn't, other people don't know that. But these are kind of pretty standard. I mean, it's no big deal. So, but that's like also, that's it when it, yeah, when it comes to these cyborg implants, there's not more. So yeah, if I want to get another thing, I have to build something myself or something. So imagine that there were like no limits and you could do anything and all the technology was out there for you. Like, what would you want to get? I think like maybe an artificial eye would be awesome. Okay. Although it should like really have a good fallback to my natural eye. I mean, yeah, let's say it would be an augmented eye because I don't, I don't want something that like when I don't have electricity or like, or there's some like, software update, then like one of my eyes is not working. That wouldn't be fun at all. So an implanted Google Glass, something like that. Yeah, something like that would be cool. But with an ad blocker. But you also said you were interested in LEDs and stuff like that. And I'm wondering, they are not that functional, right? So you are also interested in not functional. Yeah, I have to, I admit that's really just, yeah, for looking cool. Okay. But I mean, no, in an ideal world where I had like all the technology, of course, that would be censored and that stuff too. And I mean, the LEDs would light up and it would hopefully mean something. I don't know. God of the sun. Yeah. Or like, I'm happy, I'm sad or something like that. Yeah, I thought my face does that pretty good already. I needed something additional. Yeah. Is there a limit, like something you wouldn't do? Something that creeps you out? Creeps me out? No, I don't think so. But yeah, I'm, I have been thinking a lot about this. Like our body is pretty universal. I mean, like, for example, our legs, like, I mean, maybe I could have awesome artificial legs, like in this ideal world. But like, then if I was stuck on some island and then I would rather have my natural legs because I think I don't want to start having to fix my legs and having to debug the software of my legs and so on. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't give away any of my functional body parts to get artificial ones. But you could use artificial ones that are more specialized in certain things, right? Yeah. I mean, that's already happening, like in prosthetics. Like if you, there are some people, I think, yeah, one is called Yu He, you should actually totally Google him. He builds awesome artificial legs and he has, of course, he climbs a lot and he has legs for climbing that are like, really, really, really, really long and light and good for climbing. And of course, he also has legs for running and so on. But I know none of these are really as universal as our legs are. Yeah. Yeah. But then there are other fields you could enhance, for example, another sense or something like that. Yeah. So what, what could we possibly, possibly, do in that area? So you have this magnetic field detection or the... And there's also people who are trying to see ultraviolet light. Oh, nice. And actually, they are trying to do this by changing their diet. What? This is kind of a study they are doing. Yeah, because I forgot what it was. Some vitamin or something, vitamin. They are, they, I don't know. If they, if you change your diet, you can see ultraviolet light? What? No, that's the theory. Okay. But it's, it's probably, I'm afraid it's probably wrong that they are trying that. Okay. That would be cool though, yeah, if you could see like other colors or something like that. That would be incredible. Infrared, ultraviolet, they're both really interesting. I actually have an acquaintance who has cochlear implants, like for hearing, and he wants to be able to hear ultrasound. Like he wants to be able to hear beds. So yeah, he, he built some, something where he can hear this and plugs it into his cochlear implants. So it actually works. Yeah, I think I, I haven't, I have not, I'm not up to date with like the state of this project, but last time I heard it kind of works, but he wants to, but now he has to plug something in. So he wants to hack these implants to do that for him. And that's, that's kind of funny. I don't know how useful it is because I don't know what things beds have to tell, but. I guess it depends on your field of study. If you're like a bad expert, then it would help to. Yeah, you can find them more easily. Yeah. Yeah. But you could also like sit outside in the evening with your glass of wine and be like, damn beds. Like, can't they like stop screaming? Yeah. You'd think it might be, again, I think that like some of this stuff just might be kind of annoying. Cause maybe just cause I'm not used to it. Like you just have to sort of become accustomed to it. It's just, it's just a clicking noise, right? I think it's just clicking. I can't hear them. Yeah. I think it was just clicking. Oh, because they use it to navigate. Yeah. Yeah. So they, okay. Yeah. They do this click noises and then they listen to what comes back from the walls and stuff and then can try to navigate through the rooms. Echo location. Yeah. That's the word for that. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, it is pretty awesome that you would like go somewhere and be like, oh, there are beds around here and everybody around you would be like, how do you know that? Yeah. That'd be really cool. Yeah. But for, for someone who doesn't know what a cochlear implant is, what's a cochlear implant? I should have explained that. Like, yeah, it's an implant where like one part is in your ear. And the other half is like sits on the, on the outside of your head. And for some people who, who are deaf, it makes them hear. Yeah. And yeah, it's, I think they are also pretty advanced by now. Like you can plug in your iPhone and listen to music without using headphones. And some have, have Bluetooth already. Yeah. And you, and a little remote where you could like change the programs to, I don't know, to noisy room or to, or just switch it off. So yeah. And that's, I think that's really cyborg-y because it's really active technology in your head. I mean, they have to like remove part of your bone there to, to put it in. So that's not something that you would do at your local. Hopefully not. I just asked my piercer, but I think she would decline. Yeah. She hasn't even got a bone saw. Yeah, but that's really cyborg-y. So you have this technology inside your head that improves your hearing. Otherwise you wouldn't hear at all. And, and basically you have a computer outside of your head that can put signals into that. So the interesting thing is that you can improve your hearing in a lot of ways. You can have, you can add Bluetooth to the thing. So you can just put your phone in your pocket and listen to the music from your phone without headphones and stuff like that. That's really interesting. So you, you can just walk through the street and listen to music really, really loud and nobody sees actually why you're nicking your head or something like that. So what about when it comes to safety and stuff like that? Can you destroy your credit cards with your magnets and your hands? No, they are, they are too weak to do that. Yeah, fortunately. So, yeah, no, I think I've heard that you can like destroy your credit card with the, the magnets you have sometimes like in, in handbags, like for closing them. Oh. But I think that already sounds kind of strange to me because I think the magnet would have to be really strong. Yeah. But no, it doesn't work. And what about the hospital? Ah, yeah, there's this one thing about when you need to get an MRI, then that might be a problem because, I mean, usually you can't go in there with anything that's magnetic, right? Yeah. So, but there's one guy who did it and who, who had a magnet in his hand and he said, yeah, it's, it kind of felt hot and it moved and it was not exactly a nice feeling, but he was alive and it wasn't ripped out. But other people, but other people say it might be ripped out. And, yeah. So a friend of mine had to have his magnet removed. Yeah. Because of that. But, yeah, I mean, I will just think about that when, yeah, this happens and then I will be like, I'm sorry guys, before you can stick me in there, you have to cut this thing out. But I'm sure that's normal anyway. Like if people have like pins in their knee or something, I mean, all kinds of people have metal in their bodies these days. Artificial hips and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean, usually these are not ferromagnetic, right? Oh, maybe if they're really old, but I think the new stuff is all Titan or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. But yeah, usually the people at the hospital should be able to tell you. I mean, they might be like, you have what? Yeah. Would actually be, I'm actually kind of excited to like one day see the faces of. Yeah, but that's the only thing in a hospital that could be not that safe, right? Yeah. As far as I know. Yeah. And what about at the airport going through airport security and stuff like that? That doesn't do anything either. And I think like you've got, I think you already have like a other small parts of metal in like in your jeans. And also you can go through these metal detector things with like one cent in your pocket. Yeah. And I actually also went through some of this, like this tetrahertz scanner. What is it called? Body scanner thing recently. And they didn't see anything. It was kind of disappointing. So I have a friend who is pierced a lot and he's he always removes all his piercings before flying because of this metal detector stuff. That must be so annoying to do though. Yeah, that's really annoying. Like when you say a lot, like approximately how many? A lot. Okay. It's in the, I think it's, it's clearly about 50, I think nearly 100. But I think it's also about the individual size because like the usual small rings, they can't detect that. But like, you have these awesome bigger rings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And of course, then you don't want to like explain. Various sizes. Okay. But the magnets are too small for the detectors? Yeah. Okay. But I'm, I'm curious how this will be if I ever get anything else, like lots of the LED thing because I mean, maybe then they will be like, is this a bomb? I would be like, are you stupid? Carrying a bomb like that? But yeah, that might become a problem later, but it's not a problem right now. You'd have to have like a note from your piercer or something explaining what's going on. Yeah. But I don't know if that would like impress security. I don't know. So if someone wants to find out more about the cyborg community and how to go about doing this, what sort of things should they look for on the internet? Here in Berlin, there is a group of people who actually founded like what's called a Verein in Germany, like about the whole cyborg stuff. And they meet regularly, I think every second Monday at Seabase. So that's one thing. And the website is called, I mean, it's cyborgs.cc. So there's some info on there. And if you like want to meet real people, I'm not there regularly, but yeah. And I don't know. I have a like a micro site about this magnetic implant stuff, but it's just in German. Yeah. It's magnetimplantat.de. Okay. So that's your website. Yeah. And other than that, you should just Google for magnetic implant and then ignore all the search results that are about like dental magnetic implants, because obviously that exists too.", "segments":
