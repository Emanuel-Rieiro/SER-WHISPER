{"text": " Hello, John. Thanks a lot for coming on the show, Tatiana. For those of you who don't know, Tatiana is a singer, songwriter, creator of the first artist coin, and currently a team member at Bitcoin Magazine. Tatiana, welcome to the show. Thank you very much for having me. I'm happy we're able to link up. Always, always a pleasure to talk to you, Tatiana. We were just hanging out at Coins in the Kingdom in Orlando, which was a lot of fun. Yeah, absolutely. I enjoyed that. Not Disney so much. Disney was not my favorite place, but the conference itself I really liked a lot. Oh, don't lie. We had a lot of fun on It's a Small World. I got to say, I really enjoyed the performance that you and your partner gave at the blockchain wedding. That was really interesting. How did that first come about, the idea to do that? Was it last minute that they brought you in, or were you in it from the start? Well, I think that the whole blockchain wedding got put together sort of last minute. So when I had heard about it, I believe it was Rosalie who had approached me about it, saying that we were doing a blockchain wedding, which is obviously really cool and very innovative, which is stuff that I always like to get involved in. Matters of the heart, of course, are always appealing. Before I was doing Liberty Music, in between gigging in New York and stuff like that, I would do some wedding gigs. So I was like, yeah, I could sing at the wedding. It got thrown together, and then I ended up singing Make You Feel My Love by Bob Dylan. And a funny little side thing was that the groom went up to me after the wedding, and he said, what made you choose this song? And I'm like, I don't know. I just really like the song. I think it's really beautiful. And it turns out that his wife actually wanted me to sing that specific song. So I think the universe was looking out for everybody that day, and the universe gives blockchain the thumbs up. Wow. What a coincidence. It's really weird, right? It's great that it worked out that way. That was a really interesting experience. I recorded it and took pictures. It was a really, I guess, historical event to have somebody implant their wedding certificate into the blockchain. It was really interesting. So if anyone's interested in hearing more about that, a Bitcoin magazine did some coverage, I believe. You can check that out online, and maybe there's a video out there somewhere. It's this whole process of this couple getting married at this Bitcoin conference and then using a Bitcoin ATM to put their wedding certificate or their vows into the blockchain to kind of make it official, make it blockchain official. Jeffrey gave a really nice speech during that as well. I think I really enjoyed that as well. I think everybody was more moved than we thought that we were going to be, I guess. Because at first it's like sort of a kitschy thing, but it was really beautiful. It was a really nice ceremony. I saw tears in his eyes. He was very moved. Oh, Jeffrey cries a lot. Not completely, but he's a sensitive soul. Can't knock him for being an emotional human being. So how did you first get interested in peer-to-peer technology or peer-to-peer in general? What first drew you to this stuff? Well, ever since I was a kid, I always felt like music could be used to save the world. My mom, she would play a lot of Cat Stevens and Carly Simon and Bob Dylan and stuff in the car when we would drive through the mountains here in New York. We would go skiing as a family. And it had a really big influence on me, especially Cat Stevens. And unfortunately, my generation didn't really seem to have anything like that. We didn't really have a focus. We didn't have a way to contribute to the betterment of mankind. So I did find some motivation in politics. In 2008, I really liked Dennis Kucinich. But by 2012, I realized that the Federal Reserve was enemy number one. And therefore, I became a really big fan of Ron Paul. I learned a lot about Austrian economics. And I was doing a lot of different gigs for that circle. And I still do a lot of libertarian type events. After just seeing how his own party was breaking rules in order to keep him out, it became very apparent that this was not an effective method of bringing about change, that it was basically a charade. And so I was sponsored at a Ron Paul rally down in Florida by BitPay. And this is when they just first came out. And Tony Gallipi spent quite a good deal of time explaining to me about why I should care about Bitcoin. But at the time, I still didn't get it. I was like, all right, here, take a little bit of money. I bought a little Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I sold it off when it went up to like $100. But when I bought it, it was $11. And still a good return. But I kind of didn't really pay much attention to it. I went on and I would go to all these different liberty events. But again, I found myself very disappointed because now the vibe had totally changed. There was no sense of hope. It seemed very defeated. And I spent some time with Jeffrey Tucker in Libertopia in San Diego around August of 2013. And he was telling me about Bitcoin. And so I ended up going to the BitPay launch party at the Cryptocurrency Convention in Atlanta. So I sang there. And I recognized what it was that really lured me in when I first got into Ron Paul, which was that electric feeling of hope among the people. I loved that this was a way where you could fight against the man, but not have to stand outside in the freezing cold holding up a picket sign and risking getting arrested. This was sheer innovation. And I loved that. I loved the rebel spirit of it. I loved its ability to take the money out of the machine. And it just became something that was a solution versus something before that had proven to not be a solution. I think that politics is great for teaching people things. But another thing that I found difficult when I was trying to spread certain messages through my music or through different conversations, if I said I was a libertarian or if I said I was an ANCAP, people would get really turned off because if their team is Democrats or Republicans or whatever, they automatically have a wall go up. And that was very frustrating and divisive, which is the complete opposite of what I was trying to do. So with Bitcoin, I think that, first of all, it goes up against the Fed, which is still, in my opinion, public enemy number one, the banking cartel. Could you explain that a little bit? What do you mean public enemy number one? Well, I think that you can't really do anything if somebody's stealing from you. So if they're like the game is kind of rigged. So if the government can print out money whenever it wants to support its wars, you know, what are you going to do about it? You have to kind of strike at the root. And I don't think that money is evil. I think money allows you a lot of freedom, more than most things. And if they control the money, that's how they keep control of the people. So if they want to have a war, they just print out more money. And then they don't have to go to the people and say, hey, we're taxing you. They basically have an inflation tax. And people aren't really aware of that. So if you start taking your money out of the system and you start kind of broaching the topic, that way you can kind of convey the messages of freedom, convey a lot of the teachings of Ron Paul, for example, but not have to have that big wall go up. I mean, nobody likes getting ripped off. Nobody likes the fact that last year you could buy a lot more with your dollar than you can this year. And the jig is kind of up. In using Bitcoin as this tool for activism and kind of a way for opting into an alternative system to fiat money and the federal government, there have to be some challenges in doing that because I kind of got into Bitcoin for similar reasons. And it's like a process of transition. I mean, it's really hard to get people to switch over, you know, 100% to this thing overnight. And I don't really expect anybody to because the value is always changing. And so it's more like, you know, put some of your savings aside into it and just let it sit there. And then, you know, maybe use some every once in a while to pay for it. And show merchants that Bitcoin is actually something that people use. But how do you encourage people to first get into Bitcoin? Sure. But, you know, one of the main things that I like about it is that it just forces people to think about money in a completely different way. And that to me is almost more impactful than just straight up Bitcoin alone, because now you have people thinking about how value is transferred. And it's like a veil has been lifted, I think. And I think that that's a really important component of using it. But I like to tell people the different stories that I've heard. And I think that's a really important component of using it. about how Bitcoin can be really useful, how it can help the unbanked around the world. I always like to use the Women's Annex as an example. And the Women's Annex is an organization where they pay women for their blog content in Bitcoin. And previously, they had been paying them, you know, in regular money, and they would go around Afghanistan, for example. And it's not safe for somebody to go around Afghanistan with a pile of cash. And then when the women have the money, if their family, or if their husband, or if someone finds that money, they can steal it from them very easily. And then they have bigger problems than just having the money, right? Maybe they'll get beaten or God knows what. So you can send money quickly, efficiently, and for much less by using Bitcoin all around the world. So I think that there's a lot of those stories that have maybe less of a public attention paid to them. Another thing was Free Aid, another organization, they sent money to the Philippines when they had their, what do you call them? Typhoon? No, not typhoon, tidal waves. And they had the money to them in a matter of hours versus a matter of days. And that time to send that donation can be very valuable to the people that need that donation, that need that money. So I don't know. I mean, I think that there's a lot of different possibilities. And now with Bitcoin 2.0, I think that that will potentially make people think about their work ethic very differently. They're going to think about different ways to invest. And I think that it makes it a little bit more of a level playing field.", "segments": [{"start": 0.36, "end": 0.84, "text": " Hello, John.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [2425, 11, 2619, 13],

Thanks a lot for coming on the show, Tatiana. For those of you who don't know, Tatiana is a singer, songwriter, creator of the first artist coin, and currently a team member at Bitcoin Magazine. Tatiana, welcome to the show. Thank you very much for having me. I'm happy we're able to link up. Always, always a pleasure to talk to you, Tatiana. We were just hanging out at Coins in the Kingdom in Orlando, which was a lot of fun. Yeah, absolutely. I enjoyed that. Not Disney so much. Disney was not my favorite place, but the conference itself I really liked a lot. Oh, don't lie. We had a lot of fun on It's a Small World. I got to say, I really enjoyed the performance that you and your partner gave at the blockchain wedding. That was really interesting. How did that first come about, the idea to do that? Was it last minute that they brought you in, or were you in it from the start? Well, I think that the whole blockchain wedding got put together sort of last minute. So when I had heard about it, I believe it was Rosalie who had approached me about it, saying that we were doing a blockchain wedding, which is obviously really cool and very innovative, which is stuff that I always like to get involved in. Matters of the heart, of course, are always appealing. Before I was doing Liberty Music, in between gigging in New York and stuff like that, I would do some wedding gigs. So I was like, yeah, I could sing at the wedding. It got thrown together, and then I ended up singing Make You Feel My Love by Bob Dylan. And a funny little side thing was that the groom went up to me after the wedding, and he said, what made you choose this song? And I'm like, I don't know. I just really like the song. I think it's really beautiful. And it turns out that his wife actually wanted me to sing that specific song. So I think the universe was looking out for everybody that day, and the universe gives blockchain the thumbs up. Wow. What a coincidence. It's really weird, right? It's great that it worked out that way. That was a really interesting experience. I recorded it and took pictures. It was a really, I guess, historical event to have somebody implant their wedding certificate into the blockchain. It was really interesting. So if anyone's interested in hearing more about that, a Bitcoin magazine did some coverage, I believe. You can check that out online, and maybe there's a video out there somewhere. It's this whole process of this couple getting married at this Bitcoin conference and then using a Bitcoin ATM to put their wedding certificate or their vows into the blockchain to kind of make it official, make it blockchain official. Jeffrey gave a really nice speech during that as well. I think I really enjoyed that as well. I think everybody was more moved than we thought that we were going to be, I guess. Because at first it's like sort of a kitschy thing, but it was really beautiful. It was a really nice ceremony. I saw tears in his eyes. He was very moved. Oh, Jeffrey cries a lot. Not completely, but he's a sensitive soul. Can't knock him for being an emotional human being. So how did you first get interested in peer-to-peer technology or peer-to-peer in general? What first drew you to this stuff? Well, ever since I was a kid, I always felt like music could be used to save the world. My mom, she would play a lot of Cat Stevens and Carly Simon and Bob Dylan and stuff in the car when we would drive through the mountains here in New York. We would go skiing as a family. And it had a really big influence on me, especially Cat Stevens. And unfortunately, my generation didn't really seem to have anything like that. We didn't really have a focus. We didn't have a way to contribute to the betterment of mankind. So I did find some motivation in politics. In 2008, I really liked Dennis Kucinich. But by 2012, I realized that the Federal Reserve was enemy number one. And therefore, I became a really big fan of Ron Paul. I learned a lot about Austrian economics. And I was doing a lot of different gigs for that circle. And I still do a lot of libertarian type events. After just seeing how his own party was breaking rules in order to keep him out, it became very apparent that this was not an effective method of bringing about change, that it was basically a charade. And so I was sponsored at a Ron Paul rally down in Florida by BitPay. And this is when they just first came out. And Tony Gallipi spent quite a good deal of time explaining to me about why I should care about Bitcoin. But at the time, I still didn't get it. I was like, all right, here, take a little bit of money. I bought a little Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I sold it off when it went up to like $100. But when I bought it, it was $11. And still a good return. But I kind of didn't really pay much attention to it. I went on and I would go to all these different liberty events. But again, I found myself very disappointed because now the vibe had totally changed. There was no sense of hope. It seemed very defeated. And I spent some time with Jeffrey Tucker in Libertopia in San Diego around August of 2013. And he was telling me about Bitcoin. And so I ended up going to the BitPay launch party at the Cryptocurrency Convention in Atlanta. So I sang there. And I recognized what it was that really lured me in when I first got into Ron Paul, which was that electric feeling of hope among the people. I loved that this was a way where you could fight against the man, but not have to stand outside in the freezing cold holding up a picket sign and risking getting arrested. This was sheer innovation. And I loved that. I loved the rebel spirit of it. I loved its ability to take the money out of the machine. And it just became something that was a solution versus something before that had proven to not be a solution. I think that politics is great for teaching people things. But another thing that I found difficult when I was trying to spread certain messages through my music or through different conversations, if I said I was a libertarian or if I said I was an ANCAP, people would get really turned off because if their team is Democrats or Republicans or whatever, they automatically have a wall go up. And that was very frustrating and divisive, which is the complete opposite of what I was trying to do. So with Bitcoin, I think that, first of all, it goes up against the Fed, which is still, in my opinion, public enemy number one, the banking cartel. Could you explain that a little bit? What do you mean public enemy number one? Well, I think that you can't really do anything if somebody's stealing from you. So if they're like the game is kind of rigged. So if the government can print out money whenever it wants to support its wars, you know, what are you going to do about it? You have to kind of strike at the root. And I don't think that money is evil. I think money allows you a lot of freedom, more than most things. And if they control the money, that's how they keep control of the people. So if they want to have a war, they just print out more money. And then they don't have to go to the people and say, hey, we're taxing you. They basically have an inflation tax. And people aren't really aware of that. So if you start taking your money out of the system and you start kind of broaching the topic, that way you can kind of convey the messages of freedom, convey a lot of the teachings of Ron Paul, for example, but not have to have that big wall go up. I mean, nobody likes getting ripped off. Nobody likes the fact that last year you could buy a lot more with your dollar than you can this year. And the jig is kind of up. In using Bitcoin as this tool for activism and kind of a way for opting into an alternative system to fiat money and the federal government, there have to be some challenges in doing that because I kind of got into Bitcoin for similar reasons. And it's like a process of transition. I mean, it's really hard to get people to switch over, you know, 100% to this thing overnight. And I don't really expect anybody to because the value is always changing. And so it's more like, you know, put some of your savings aside into it and just let it sit there. And then, you know, maybe use some every once in a while to pay for it. And show merchants that Bitcoin is actually something that people use. But how do you encourage people to first get into Bitcoin? Sure. But, you know, one of the main things that I like about it is that it just forces people to think about money in a completely different way. And that to me is almost more impactful than just straight up Bitcoin alone, because now you have people thinking about how value is transferred. And it's like a veil has been lifted, I think. And I think that that's a really important component of using it. But I like to tell people the different stories that I've heard. And I think that's a really important component of using it. about how Bitcoin can be really useful, how it can help the unbanked around the world. I always like to use the Women's Annex as an example. And the Women's Annex is an organization where they pay women for their blog content in Bitcoin. And previously, they had been paying them, you know, in regular money, and they would go around Afghanistan, for example. And it's not safe for somebody to go around Afghanistan with a pile of cash. And then when the women have the money, if their family, or if their husband, or if someone finds that money, they can steal it from them very easily. And then they have bigger problems than just having the money, right? Maybe they'll get beaten or God knows what. So you can send money quickly, efficiently, and for much less by using Bitcoin all around the world. So I think that there's a lot of those stories that have maybe less of a public attention paid to them. Another thing was Free Aid, another organization, they sent money to the Philippines when they had their, what do you call them? Typhoon? No, not typhoon, tidal waves. And they had the money to them in a matter of hours versus a matter of days. And that time to send that donation can be very valuable to the people that need that donation, that need that money. So I don't know. I mean, I think that there's a lot of different possibilities. And now with Bitcoin 2.0, I think that that will potentially make people think about their work ethic very differently. They're going to think about different ways to invest. And I think that it makes it a little bit more of a level playing field.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "start": 0.36, "end": 0.84, "text": " Hello, John.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [2425, 11, 2619, 13],
