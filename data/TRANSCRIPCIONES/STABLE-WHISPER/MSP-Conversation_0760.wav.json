{"text": " What an absurdity. You're telling me that people have to run up and down the street firing guns out of windows and killing their brethren because we didn't get reparations for slavery handed over to you yet? Because somebody who was mayor of this city 10 years ago happened to be a racist? Because the police department has somebody who's affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan in it? And you're telling me that that explains or somehow excuses or cancels out the moral judgment that I would otherwise bring to bear against any other community in which I saw this happening? You're telling me that the history of slavery in Jim Crow, now a century in the past, is pertinent to our reaction to this lived experience on a daily basis of African Americans in my American city? You're beneath contempt to talk in that way. You're the one who has no real respect for the value of black life. You live in a bubble. Why don't you get out of it and walk the streets of some of these places where people have died? Now, Coates will flash out, oh, well, I was raised in Baltimore at a time when I've seen enough gang activity and I know what's going on inside and out and I've been there, whatever. And Landrieu can say the body count continues to mount while your blather titillates the cultural elites in Washington, D.C. and New York City and gives guilty white people an excuse not to feel so guilty. While you blather on, we're actually burying the dead. Landrieu might have responded to him like that. He might have told him to get the heck out of here with that nonsense that attempts to intellectualize what any person with common sense can see as an absolute disaster. You're blaming white people for black people living some like barbarians? You're blaming white people for that? He might have said to him. That's what I said to him. Landrieu folded the hand with a pair of hands. Now you've convinced me that we need to stage a public debate between you and Coates and put it on primetime television. That'll be worth seeing. Let's talk about the mayhem. Let's get into the question of violence. So here's the basic picture as I understand it. America is distinguished as one of the most violent societies in the developed world, as almost everyone knows, almost entirely because of the level of crime and violence in the black community. And this is true even if you include all the mass shootings from crazy white guys that make the news. Violent crime in America is overwhelmingly a problem of black men killing other black men. And what I just learned in preparation for this podcast, and I'm embarrassed not to have really had a complete picture of this problem, but you recommended this book, Ghetto Side, on your podcast, which I also recommend. What I just learned is that this has been a problem more or less since the end of slavery. It didn't start with the crack epidemic in the 80s, which is more or less what I thought, and I think many people believe. And you can read newspaper editorials in the 19th century that give the predictable racist topspin to this, where they say more or less, this is God's form of population control. Let the black man kill himself out of existence. That works for us. But so this problem of black men killing other black men is an old problem. And again, I'm not saying that white racism or structural racism or both, white personal racism or the structures that endure even after that's overcome don't have some role to play here. But the facts on the ground is that black men are killing other black men in overwhelming numbers. And violent crime in America peaked in 1993, and it has fallen precipitously since, perhaps with the exception of a recent uptick in major cities, which people fear is due to cops now being afraid to be caught on cell phone cameras arresting black suspects. So this has now been called the Ferguson effect. And I'm not sure, I mean, do you have an opinion at this point about whether the Ferguson effect is actually real or is the jury still out on that? I think the jury is still out on it. I don't think enough time has gone by with enough data for there to really be a persuasive empirical argument. It's speculation. You do have the accounts of some people active in law enforcement in cities around the country saying, indeed, cops are pulling back, morale is low, everybody is armed with a mobile phone recording device now, and they are afraid to do their jobs. You have this kind of anecdotal evidence. Heather McDonald at the Haddon Institute, whose book, The War on Cops, has just come out recently, is a leading proponent of the Ferguson effect. There's a guy, I'll think of his name in a moment, not at Washington University, I think it's the University of Missouri, his name is Rosenfeld. I'll think of the first name momentarily, Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, who is an expert criminologist who has recently been saying, at first he thought the Ferguson effect was an exaggeration, but now with the uptick in data of violent crime in cities and so forth, he's not so sure. So there's some people who are big proponents of it. There are a lot of people who are deniers of it. And Richard Rosenfeld, I place him in the middle as a relatively objective observer, and he's saying the jury is out. So I'm going to go with him and say, as far as I can tell, it's not here one way or the other quite yet. But anyway, you were saying. So, and this is, again, these are facts that some of you are familiar with, but many of the numbers I have now are plucked from that book, Ghetto Side. At its peak, violent crime, and this is, again, 1993 in a city like Los Angeles, the homicide rate for black men in their early 20s was 368 per 100,000 per year. Now that is a hundred times higher than is normal in any civilized society that we would recognize. In fact, it's more than that. It's probably 200 times higher than most cities in Western Europe. And I don't even think about someplace like Japan. That's completely off the map. And it's a similar rate of death as that suffered by US soldiers deployed to Iraq at the height of the war. So you have young black men who are literally living in a war zone, and they're killing one another. And again, so the crime rate has fallen since, but it remains, the proportion in the black community remains as high. In fact, it might actually be a little higher. It might not have fallen quite as much in the black community in the last 20 years. The facts on the ground, at the moment, as I understand them, are that black men comprise 6% of the population, and they are currently 40% of those who get murdered. And again, they die in the vast majority of cases at the hands of other black men who commit over 50% of the murders in the country. So you have 6% of the population committing over 50% of the murders. Most of those murders are of other black men. Now is that, do I have my facts straight up to that point? You consist, I mean, I don't have a book open in front of me to give exact numbers, but those numbers are, as far as I know, accurate. Certainly qualitatively, they're in the ballpark. I've seen the same kind of statistics, yes. That's correct. What you said is correct. I'll put just one other fact in play here, which I really, again, I think I learned from this book, Ghetto Side. And I guess if you had asked me before reading the book, I could have told you something like this, but I didn't have this concrete statement in my head, and it seems very important, which is that we know that there's been a problem of extraordinarily bad policing in the black community, and far too often by white cops, right? So there have been some very, visible instances of cops who've used inappropriate force in arresting or in defending themselves from black suspects. And the result is that the community believes itself to be unfairly profiled for crime, and that it suffers an inordinate number of lethal encounters with cops as a result. Now, and we're certainly going to talk about whether that perception is true in terms of the level of lethality from encounters with cops, but there's no question that, a movement like Black Lives Matter is born of the perception that these facts are true, and that white racism, whether it's implicit or explicit, is the underlying cause of all this. But one thing I got from Ghetto Side is that, and you mentioned this already, that there's a lot of talk about how the criminal justice system disproportionately targets and incarcerates young black men. That seems to be true when you're talking about petty crimes, or when you're talking about the war on drugs, which has obviously been a disaster. But murders in the black community generally go unsolved. And the main reason is that witnesses refuse to testify. And obviously, some of that reluctance is understandable because they're afraid of getting killed. But it seems to me that this is a problem that can't be pinned on police misconduct or white racism. But the problem in the hood is that you have murderers walking around unpunished, right? And the state monopoly on violence just doesn't exist. And so people either refuse to testify or they take the law into their own hands, and it perpetuates the cycle of violence. So paradoxically, or seemingly paradoxically, the black community is suffering from too much application of law and order on petty crimes and on nonviolent drug crimes, which I have argued before no one should be punished for, and too little law and order on crimes that really matter. You have a kind of state of nature situation with respect to murder in", "segments": [{"start": 0.38, "end": 1.48, "text": " What an absurdity.", "seek": 0.0, "tokens": [708, 364, 19774, 507, 13],

You're telling me that people have to run up and down the street firing guns out of windows and killing their brethren because we didn't get reparations for slavery handed over to you yet? Because somebody who was mayor of this city 10 years ago happened to be a racist? Because the police department has somebody who's affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan in it? And you're telling me that that explains or somehow excuses or cancels out the moral judgment that I would otherwise bring to bear against any other community in which I saw this happening? You're telling me that the history of slavery in Jim Crow, now a century in the past, is pertinent to our reaction to this lived experience on a daily basis of African Americans in my American city? You're beneath contempt to talk in that way. You're the one who has no real respect for the value of black life. You live in a bubble. Why don't you get out of it and walk the streets of some of these places where people have died? Now, Coates will flash out, oh, well, I was raised in Baltimore at a time when I've seen enough gang activity and I know what's going on inside and out and I've been there, whatever. And Landrieu can say the body count continues to mount while your blather titillates the cultural elites in Washington, D.C. and New York City and gives guilty white people an excuse not to feel so guilty. While you blather on, we're actually burying the dead. Landrieu might have responded to him like that. He might have told him to get the heck out of here with that nonsense that attempts to intellectualize what any person with common sense can see as an absolute disaster. You're blaming white people for black people living some like barbarians? You're blaming white people for that? He might have said to him. That's what I said to him. Landrieu folded the hand with a pair of hands. Now you've convinced me that we need to stage a public debate between you and Coates and put it on primetime television. That'll be worth seeing. Let's talk about the mayhem. Let's get into the question of violence. So here's the basic picture as I understand it. America is distinguished as one of the most violent societies in the developed world, as almost everyone knows, almost entirely because of the level of crime and violence in the black community. And this is true even if you include all the mass shootings from crazy white guys that make the news. Violent crime in America is overwhelmingly a problem of black men killing other black men. And what I just learned in preparation for this podcast, and I'm embarrassed not to have really had a complete picture of this problem, but you recommended this book, Ghetto Side, on your podcast, which I also recommend. What I just learned is that this has been a problem more or less since the end of slavery. It didn't start with the crack epidemic in the 80s, which is more or less what I thought, and I think many people believe. And you can read newspaper editorials in the 19th century that give the predictable racist topspin to this, where they say more or less, this is God's form of population control. Let the black man kill himself out of existence. That works for us. But so this problem of black men killing other black men is an old problem. And again, I'm not saying that white racism or structural racism or both, white personal racism or the structures that endure even after that's overcome don't have some role to play here. But the facts on the ground is that black men are killing other black men in overwhelming numbers. And violent crime in America peaked in 1993, and it has fallen precipitously since, perhaps with the exception of a recent uptick in major cities, which people fear is due to cops now being afraid to be caught on cell phone cameras arresting black suspects. So this has now been called the Ferguson effect. And I'm not sure, I mean, do you have an opinion at this point about whether the Ferguson effect is actually real or is the jury still out on that? I think the jury is still out on it. I don't think enough time has gone by with enough data for there to really be a persuasive empirical argument. It's speculation. You do have the accounts of some people active in law enforcement in cities around the country saying, indeed, cops are pulling back, morale is low, everybody is armed with a mobile phone recording device now, and they are afraid to do their jobs. You have this kind of anecdotal evidence. Heather McDonald at the Haddon Institute, whose book, The War on Cops, has just come out recently, is a leading proponent of the Ferguson effect. There's a guy, I'll think of his name in a moment, not at Washington University, I think it's the University of Missouri, his name is Rosenfeld. I'll think of the first name momentarily, Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, who is an expert criminologist who has recently been saying, at first he thought the Ferguson effect was an exaggeration, but now with the uptick in data of violent crime in cities and so forth, he's not so sure. So there's some people who are big proponents of it. There are a lot of people who are deniers of it. And Richard Rosenfeld, I place him in the middle as a relatively objective observer, and he's saying the jury is out. So I'm going to go with him and say, as far as I can tell, it's not here one way or the other quite yet. But anyway, you were saying. So, and this is, again, these are facts that some of you are familiar with, but many of the numbers I have now are plucked from that book, Ghetto Side. At its peak, violent crime, and this is, again, 1993 in a city like Los Angeles, the homicide rate for black men in their early 20s was 368 per 100,000 per year. Now that is a hundred times higher than is normal in any civilized society that we would recognize. In fact, it's more than that. It's probably 200 times higher than most cities in Western Europe. And I don't even think about someplace like Japan. That's completely off the map. And it's a similar rate of death as that suffered by US soldiers deployed to Iraq at the height of the war. So you have young black men who are literally living in a war zone, and they're killing one another. And again, so the crime rate has fallen since, but it remains, the proportion in the black community remains as high. In fact, it might actually be a little higher. It might not have fallen quite as much in the black community in the last 20 years. The facts on the ground, at the moment, as I understand them, are that black men comprise 6% of the population, and they are currently 40% of those who get murdered. And again, they die in the vast majority of cases at the hands of other black men who commit over 50% of the murders in the country. So you have 6% of the population committing over 50% of the murders. Most of those murders are of other black men. Now is that, do I have my facts straight up to that point? You consist, I mean, I don't have a book open in front of me to give exact numbers, but those numbers are, as far as I know, accurate. Certainly qualitatively, they're in the ballpark. I've seen the same kind of statistics, yes. That's correct. What you said is correct. I'll put just one other fact in play here, which I really, again, I think I learned from this book, Ghetto Side. And I guess if you had asked me before reading the book, I could have told you something like this, but I didn't have this concrete statement in my head, and it seems very important, which is that we know that there's been a problem of extraordinarily bad policing in the black community, and far too often by white cops, right? So there have been some very, visible instances of cops who've used inappropriate force in arresting or in defending themselves from black suspects. And the result is that the community believes itself to be unfairly profiled for crime, and that it suffers an inordinate number of lethal encounters with cops as a result. Now, and we're certainly going to talk about whether that perception is true in terms of the level of lethality from encounters with cops, but there's no question that, a movement like Black Lives Matter is born of the perception that these facts are true, and that white racism, whether it's implicit or explicit, is the underlying cause of all this. But one thing I got from Ghetto Side is that, and you mentioned this already, that there's a lot of talk about how the criminal justice system disproportionately targets and incarcerates young black men. That seems to be true when you're talking about petty crimes, or when you're talking about the war on drugs, which has obviously been a disaster. But murders in the black community generally go unsolved. And the main reason is that witnesses refuse to testify. And obviously, some of that reluctance is understandable because they're afraid of getting killed. But it seems to me that this is a problem that can't be pinned on police misconduct or white racism. But the problem in the hood is that you have murderers walking around unpunished, right? And the state monopoly on violence just doesn't exist. And so people either refuse to testify or they take the law into their own hands, and it perpetuates the cycle of violence. So paradoxically, or seemingly paradoxically, the black community is suffering from too much application of law and order on petty crimes and on nonviolent drug crimes, which I have argued before no one should be punished for, and too little law and order on crimes that really matter.
