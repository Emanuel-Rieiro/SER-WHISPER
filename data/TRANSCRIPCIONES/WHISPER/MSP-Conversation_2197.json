    "text": " Alright, here we go guys. So this is Yaro and hello. You're probably very familiar with me already if you're watching me do a vlog like this, a video blog. Why am I doing this? So first of all I just want to preface this by the fact that I've just got together a whole bunch of new video equipment. I'm recording this on a GoPro 7 Hero Black. I've got a plug-in mic for it which is meant to help with obviously the feedback noise. I'm in a really quiet space here in my apartment in Vancouver which I'm about to move away from. I've got my GorillaPod set up. I've got an LED light set up. I've got my phone here with the notes that I want to talk to you about and the reason why I'm telling you all this is that it's brand new. I've got a lot of stuff that I've been doing and it's going to get better. So I probably haven't quite figured out the lighting, the sound, the positioning of my body. I was watching before trying to get the right space above me here. GoPro has this wide view angle with the camera so you can see no doubt already all this stuff in the background. So I haven't, you know, made the background too pretty other than my nice little pillow here. So yeah, I just wanted to say it's going to get better but I'm a big fan of just getting out there and creating the content and, you know, incrementally. I definitely want to pretty much do the same for this whole look-up, the whole frame of it at the very top. It's going to look good as a result but because I'm accomplish it's just going to be way less good for me on the overall look and maybe some special touch and some also sort of light in the background as well rate, HDR I guess on the back of the head but you can see that here there's the HGTV camera on the front and the bottom here but you can also what's in the screen on the left and it's going to go greatly blue. So really, then you kind of need a very light fit or I'm just going to go a little bit up here again on the front. You're right, it's going to get a little bit dark here as youested a little bit. It's still nice enough up here. So if I can, I at night but I rarely do much work at night I'm definitely sitting on the couch you know I've got the weakest willpower when it comes to food so and speaking of food I actually have pretty much given up sugar refined sugars fructose lactose I wasn't drinking milk anyway so lactose was gone a long time ago fruit was mostly gone except for bananas and smoothies obviously refined sugar cane sugar was out of my diet but now I'm cutting even like my old favorite chocolate you've probably seen me if you follow me on Instagram and Facebook put up some ketogenic recipes and well no recipes recipes yes but also me cooking them so I made some cookies I made some fat bombs the reason why they're their keto is primarily because that's the best to find a recipe that's got no sugar yet has some kind of a fat content and that's why I'm cutting my dairy in this case it's because Jooong's Diet\u0430\u043a\u0430 that's a great approach to what his problems are but you know diet easily it's not always quite as smart and it's basically these two nutrients really have todepend on each other or the person it is and I know if your nutrition might be a little challenging for sure and you can probably be OK with those and research one that is what I'm using right now is settlotol just like the Raft but it's good for you keto, you know, trying to keep your carb count down to stay in ketosis. It's all good. And I have to say, I love the cookies and I love the fat bombs in particular, which is basically almond butter and cacao, but they're chocolatey and really nice. So I've, you know, become pretty much at the start of this year, 2019, way better with my sugar intake, almost down to zero now. I'm still having smoothies and things, but I'm trying to even get that down to zero. And when I say smoothies, it's really just the banana, half a banana in it is where the sugar is. But the point being at night was when I would generally eat most of my chocolate, you know, it would be the whole 100 grams of almost 100 grams. I'd finish off 100 gram green and blacks, 85% dark chocolate bar. Now that's still not a lot of sugar. That's probably 15 grams in 100 gram bar because it's about 15% sugar. But it's a pretty regular daily habit. And if you add that, you know, a smoothie, you know, it's a pretty regular daily habit. And if you add that, you know, a smoothie in and probably some sugars here and there, you'd find snuck into food. It did add up. So I'm trying to get down to as close to zero as I can and get that sugar craving handled with the keto desserts, which is working really well. I actually really do like those desserts. Obviously, it's a mental thing as well. The fact that I even need to still look for keto desserts shows that I haven't broken free from the mental connection there, the addiction to it. But it's an improvement, a big one. And I'm certainly big on incremental improvements. So the way I bring all this up, nighttimes, I'm trying to replace some of my bad habits with some better habits and vlogging and doing these videos. I love creating content. So I thought, you know what, I should start actually using some of my nighttime for two things. One is these, create some content. And this is something I can easily do. So I wanted to set up this camera equipment so I can be anywhere in the world, plonk my GorillaPod down with my GoPro and my light and my microphone and some notes on my phone. And just do a vlog. And if I can do it almost daily, fantastic. It probably won't be daily. I'm not going to promise any sort of consistency whatsoever. I'm going to do this as I feel. But I like having the option, especially as I travel, because often as I travel and this is something I'm trying to work on this year as I begin some digital nomading, I don't have a lot of friends in certain places. So I often land in new cities and I'm an introvert. So, you know, I'm not going to be excited about pushing myself. I'm not going to be excited about pushing myself into social circumstances. I will do that to try and build my my friendship circle. And I'm going to deliberately choose to visit places where I know people are ready so I can have people on the ground and hopefully meet some of you perhaps watching this video or my videos I'll do throughout the year. But the point being, I will be able to have a few good healthy options for spending my nights, not just Netflix by myself and being tempted to eat too much food and, you know, sugars again and so forth. So this gives me something fun to do. And I want to do as the point to is be a bit more social. So I will use my time at night perhaps to look for social things to do in new cities, maybe even do some phone calls with friends around the world. Crazy. I'm not a big phone talker, but I do want to keep connections strong with people, certain people try and deepen some connections with some of my friends and grow some new friendships. Hopefully that will become deep as well. So my night times, I want to do that perhaps instead of just sitting on this couch here and, you know, watching four hours a day. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do it with products sold without even wanting to have any famed videos or Netflix, and I'd say like two to three times a day, I think it's fireworks. and learning and benefiting from and what's working in my business as a kind of a regular blogging practice because that was what blogging was about telling you know the the journal the the um the online diary uh diarizing of whatever your blog is about and my blog was an entrepreneurship blog so i would write all kinds of stuff about how my card game business was going my my editing company was going and then my my blogging coaching business how that was going and then you know over time you kind of get a little bit lost in all the other things that you can uh do online all the social media pops up i have more businesses i have my team growing so i have to coordinate working with them it just became much different the way i create content way more strategic way more focused it's not necessarily a bad thing you know i knuckled down and created product i created email funnels um my blog content became much more specific in terms of guiding people to opt-ins and teaching key lessons so it wasn't as as diarizing what was going on and i don't think i can go back to that in terms of my writing i still need to be quite strategic with my writing time and use it that way whether it's writing a book or an email sequence or notes for a product but this i can do i can talk to you guys for half an hour to an hour and update you on what i did maybe even the last 24 hours which can be very much about you know business things or money making related things can also be social things and travel you know i i'm i love uh sharing where i visit and i want to share more of that with you uh i'm not aiming to be like a super pro vlogger with amazing editing this could be as good as it gets it could be me sitting in front of whatever airbnb couch i'm at and talking to you if that's the case and i only have you know 10 people watching these videos that's fine i'm kind of doing it as much for me as i'll be doing it for you guys watching so i don't know what to say i'm a little bit more focused on that but i'll I don't mind, but hey, who knows? Maybe we'll get a following and it'll grow over time. I do know one thing is the hardcore Yarrow fans out there, you guys will be watching this all the way to the end. So I'm doing this for you very much as well. And I know from my point of view, I love getting that background insight from other entrepreneurs. One of my favorite things to do when I do have dinner with someone is like, what are they working on? You know, I catch up with some of my friends and I'm like, what did you just do with your business? Most recently, you know, what's working? What are you planning on next? And I love that behind the scenes specifics. What are they actioning? What are they building? What did they just create? What marketing techniques are they doing that work? So I can do the same thing for you in these videos. I've got some notes here to talk about basically my day to day and everything that happened. So it'll give you a real insight into kind of like a day in the life on an ongoing basis. Or it might completely change because frankly, I never want to promise any kind of specific outcome when it comes to my content creation because things and everything inevitably change. Directions change, goals change, timing changes. So who knows? I may only do one video like this and this is it or not. But I certainly hope I can continue some kind of ongoing dialogue with you.",
