    "text": " I would love to talk about that. I'd love to talk about all the things that you're doing that you'd like to share with us. Tell me a little bit, though, about this whole hip situation. Okay, cool. Well, I think all office have a different kind of, almost kind of a resonant rhythm whenever we're walking, and there are so many factors that are going to go into that. There's leg length, hip distance, so hip width, that's when we're looking at pelvis width, and a lot of it is also we all have a different kind of elastic tuning to our tissues. Sure. Maybe it was more loosely or more tightly kind of put together. Yeah. It's all the hypermobility tests. So some of us are just a little bit more muscular, some of us a little bit more elastic, some of us are very tightly bound, some of us loosely bound. And so there's... There are some kind of biomechanical factors and variables that be in it. And then there's also psychology. There's just, you know, what's your attitude about movement? What's your natural tendency? You know, we see people that are very, you know, and we were in New York, and it's fascinating, you know, New Yorkers are kind of, they're direct. It's like they're direct in their talk, they're direct in their actions, and they're direct in their movement. And they have to be to survive. You know, I remember, you know, I'm from a little town, you know, 10,000 people on the edge of Belfast, Northern Ireland, which is why I have a slightly different, weird accent. And, like, there, it was like, if you're at a crossing, and if there was one other person there, it was like, it was, my goodness, what's that person doing at my crossing? But in New York, it's like, it's like the stampede. It's like that's the migration across the Serengeti. Yeah. But you're not all going in the same direction. You've got one herd going one way and the other herd coming the other way. So you have to stand your ground. You're... Oh, very much, yeah. Going forward. And so some of us are a little bit more laid back in our movement and are walking. Some of us go for, you know, for a saunter. And some of us, you know, we're full on kind of pushing through it. And some of that is sort of the psychology. So, and that's going to pertain, go back to whether we're using more of a muscular kind of pushing strategy or whether we're using, you know, more of a kind of a relaxed kind of elastic strategy. And, you know, it's all, there are so many variables that will go into speed. And that it's kind of, it's, you know, I would need to, to see, see what's happening with your wives and what's happening with the two of you. And to be able to kind of go, oh, okay, well, I think it's more of this variable or that variable. But whenever we're together in September, one of the dynamics we're talking about, but it's kind of epidemic within a lot of the literature that women tend to have wider hips. And the literature would kind of believe that actually gives less efficiency because they've got wider hips, they've got kind of a wider lever. Whenever you're standing on one leg, they have to support their body weight on a longer lever. So that actually gives them more work to do. But actually a combination of a couple of different parameters. So, you know, one of the papers that would come out, one from Dan Lieberman said, well, actually the thinking was wrong. The calculations are wrong. Actually doesn't make them any less efficient at all. And then another paper was actually saying, well, actually some of the extra width that may actually lead to more efficiency or a different type of efficiency. And a lot of women or people with wider hips, let's just say, cause there's an overlap. There's no absolute, there's no male pelvis. Sure. Yeah. This is about weight and pelvis. So actually having a wider pelvis allows people with wider pelvises to walk together and be happier at a kind of communal speed. So with a more narrow pelvis, we have a narrow and happy speed. So if we have to walk more quickly or more slowly than our happy speeds, it costs us more energy. So, you know, we're talking about shorter, longer, smaller, longer, longer, longer, shorter, shorter, longer, longer, longer, longer, longer, longer, longer, longer, longer. So I think I'm kind of getting it. I can't. I can't. I can't. Okay. Sure. And if you have a narrow pelvis, you have a very narrow kind of efficient speed. Whereas with a wider pelvis, you've got a more of a, in that graph, we have a kind of a wider range at which you can still be kind of strolling along and being quite happy and still maintain a chat and, and that, that could be more quickly or more slowly than our narrow pelvis. So yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. I mean, I, I don't think it's always a good idea. kind of bias that's interesting this is kind of random I there's some musician friends of mine who so my former life I was a musician for a living so but there was a very famous musician Joe Zawinul is his name from Austria actually he was a jazz musician very successfully passed away a few years ago but I remember him talking about gate and not in terms of biomechanics but in terms of confidence a lot of different things whether they're angry happy and I actually I hadn't planned on mentioning this or asking this question but do our emotion emotions have anything to do with our gate absolutely and and that's what we used to do when we were young and we were young and we were young and we were opened to females generally and she said wunderbar would your best insight for and just on that thank you go on of the Sun so full of energy and brightness and then going for a walk with the energy of the different energies of the planets but going for a walk like Mars if you want to if you want to survive in New York you have to you take on the warrior like kind of strength of God and and then there's a the the more loose rhythmic maybe seductive movement of Venus okay well we can actually change our emotions by taking on these movement patterns and of course this this this works both ways that our movement will reflect or moods you can tell you know maybe if you see your wife walking down the street at a distance you know whether you're in trouble or not you know whether you're in trouble or not sometimes she explains something yeah thinking back to your mother or you know I was just doing that too I was just doing it yeah I remember yeah and it's kind of it's it you know it is literally a two-way street that's our our emotions affect our movements but we can also affect our emotions by by moving in a different way by moving in different characters and and you know that's some of the the attitude that we have to take on it's interesting you know we use attitude in both those senses and attitudes physical interesting I haven't you know it's interesting I sort of knew this but you just have to explain it for me in a much more complete summary like in our workshops that I teach the Parkinson's things we you know like for example in Parkinson's disease a lot of times they'll have a more stooped over posture you know a lot of people do anyways in fact I do if I'm not careful it's easy for me to be kind of forward you know I'm sitting a lot I'm on planes a lot and whatever but in Parkinson's it tends to be a little more exaggerated but also the number one non-motor symptom is depression so depressed people don't usually walk with really super upright posture and confident gait yeah but one of the things that I've learned is that you know you can't just walk with really super upright posture you can't just do it straight the other way but but one of the things we found to be helpful is when we when we cue them into gradually we have kind of a process I like to go through to create more of a gradual awareness of what they can be moving like versus what they usually move like and putting in some arm swing initiated from the shoulder joint a little bit of reciprocal arm swing plus some trunk rotation you know bit more upright and then when they walk more upright and I call it like walking like a badass or walking with an attitude because you you can't you're not going to walk around all upright if you're depressed but if you can start to get into more upright position velocity increases usually stability improves a little and you know what they just start to feel a little bit better like oh yeah it feels good so that that totally makes sense about how each one affects each emotions affect movement movement can affect emotions yeah yep and I'm bringing back memories again whenever I was studying as a kid for exams and I used to study late at night and occasionally I couldn't to let myself go to sleep and after studying I had to go for a walk and I had a recording of is out to meet us and kind of the Jean-Michel Jarre and kind of equivalent Japanese but he had a whole planet suite all on synthesizer so I used to go for a walk around the countryside at two o'clock in the morning listening to this the whole planet suite and I would sometimes go through those different kind of moods so each planet had a different mood and I'm kind of thinking of the the Mars sequence and it's very it's very Marshall it's very upright it's very confident it's very strident and again you got that overlap of languages and physicality motion to be strident to just try it out to be strong yeah yeah absolutely I'm going a little off track here but I'm going back to New York City because it's very interesting to see the difference in different cultures and movement cities and movement of course you've seen that probably more than anyone you do a lot of traveling quite a bit I do a lot of traveling but you go a lot of places yeah I'm slowly done yeah so it's interesting like in New York City you're right there's this herd thing and you stay you have to stand your ground the way you said that so appropriate because otherwise you're gonna get run over same thing when you're driving in New York City I mean you know that's why I take over but uh subway but versus let's say going to pretty much anywhere else right so I guess that that kind of also makes me wonder how much society has to do with movement like where you live does that affect your your movement like subconsciously you just take on certain movement of a certain where you are yeah and I know oh so much talk about with that and I once upon time I was working with a another teacher and he had a particular walk he's very very bendy but a very strong guy and he had a particular kind of wavy walk it was very particular to him and he had a he had child little boy and we had a big meeting once and and we were hanging out after the meeting in the bar and he was playing with this kid and eventually it was 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. okay it's bedtime and so we we watched him leading his little boy across the dance floor and across the country from front to the bar back off to the hotel room and if you see both of them moving in exactly the same particular way so we you know there's a there's a level of influences and in the style of movement I want to you know as a kid your your input how do I move kind of the first strongest influence is going to be parents so I get to see my parents and I see my children I get to see my parents and I see my kids and I see my kids and I see my kids. and this is how we walk. And then, especially as teenagers, there was going to be a certain culture, and I don't know about you, whenever you were growing up, for me, it was kind of sort of modern rockers, they had a different style of dress, and a little bit of different movement. As a rocker, you had to have a certain, again, certain attitude. And I grew up close to Belfast, so during the 70s and 80s, there was the Troubles, and the conflict between, it was kind of a simplification Protestant-Catholic thing, and every 12th of July, the Protestants would put on lots of parades, and kind of show their supposed dominance and superiority, and they would walk in the street, you could tell that you were getting close to that time, when a certain section would start kind of walking with their shoulders up and their elbows out, and it was a little bit more of a swan. And that was my first kind of, impression then, traveling a little bit more around through England. I thought, actually, there's a, kind of like there's a New York walk, there's a London walk, and I think there was a Boston walk as well, is a little more uptight, little bit more contained, a little less space than the New Yorkers. New Yorkers, you have to fight for your space. And maybe around Liverpool, there's a kind of, there's a very strong sea, and there's a lot of influence. So there's a little bit more of a role to their walk. And, you know, so was the whole kind of, the Beatles and the, the music is really important. So I do think different cultures, different cities, different energies, musical influences, cultural influences. Have you gone across Gil Headley?",
