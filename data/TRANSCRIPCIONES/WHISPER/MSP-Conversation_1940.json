    "text": " So was that the beginning of the end? That was absolutely, that moment was the beginning of the end. And if we hadn't had small children, it would have also been the end of the end. I would have gone home and packed up my shit and he never would have seen me again. But my daughter was six months old. Yeah. My son was two. I was like, I can't leave this guy right now. You know, we had 10 fairly decent-ish years, really good in some ways. He's a pretty good dad. I can't, just because this one thing has gone wrong, I don't think I can necessarily just throw all that away because of the kids. Yeah. So I tried really, really hard to stay. We sold our house and moved to a different state so we could not be running into this guy that worked at the same university where I did. Yeah. That I. I just really would so much rather prefer to have been with him instead of my partner at the time. I really wanted to go off with him instead. So you were probably dealing with a little bit of heartbreak about not being able to see that person anymore. Oh, for years. Yeah. Absolutely. I, yes, it was very painful for him too. It stomped him. It was really terrible for him. And it was not great for my partner. I mean, I didn't have a partner either. My partner at the time, the kid's dad, I mean, it was bad for all of us. Yeah. Everybody came out of that worse off than we went into it. Unfortunately. Mm-hmm. We got couples counseling. I got individual counseling. I went on antidepressants. I tried aromatherapy and hypnotherapy and homeopathy. Everything. Everything. And I came home from work one day. I was like, I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to work one day. And the kids were fighting. I could hear them in another room and I walked into the kitchen and the house was a mess. And my partner was all like, started bitching at me about something the instant I walked in the door. And I was like, oh God, I need a drink if I'm going to deal with this. And I was like, oh shit. Did I just say I need a drink? Yeah. For family life? I need a drink to be able to tolerate walking into this. Yeah. I was like, I need a drink. I need a drink. And so I walked into this room. Oh, that is not going to work. I knew that instant I had to leave him. Okay. Um, because while it was good, I think to stick around and try as hard as I could to make it work, it was clear to me that I had done my best and it was going to go downhill. Like I was staying for the children. Yeah. And for me to become an angry, bitter alcoholic. Would not have been fun for them. Would not have been good for them. No. Absolutely not. And they were getting a little older anyway. Yes. At this stage. A little bit. I mean, they still, they were still little kids, but it had been five years that I had hung on by the skin of my teeth. I tried so hard. Yeah. And in terms of breakups, I really felt like giving it my all, my very best effort on every level. Yeah. To try to make it work. Then made, at least for me, made the breakup much more manageable because I knew. That you had tried. I had tried every single thing. There was no regret like, oh, should I have stuck it out a bit longer? Exactly. Or should I have, you knew you'd really reached the end game. Exactly. And that it was going to go, it had gotten. Toxic. Or it was going to become so. Absolutely. For me. Yeah. Absolutely. And he was fine. As in much of our relationship, he was fine with me bearing the emotional cost. As long as he got what he wanted, he was fine with that. So he got to stay married. And the fact that I was miserable was really less important to him. And he got to, you know, like when we were considering monogamy in the first place and our non-monogamy and I was saying, this is really hurting me. I need you to know that this conversation. Mm. Is incredibly painful. And I think a lot of people might not know that for a monogamous person, for their partner to say, I want an open relationship. Even if the partner is not saying you're not enough for me. So I need to open things up. That is most likely how the monogamous person is going to hear it. And that's a very painful, very painful thing for me. Mm. Because I felt like he was saying over and over, you're too fat and you're bad in bed. And that wasn't what he meant. Oh, totally not. Because I mean, people who are doing polyamory well, you know, it's so far from, from people not being enough for them. Absolutely. Well, it's a whole world of things, isn't it? Of very positive, compassionate, loving things. Definitely. But I think for monogamous people, if they don't feel that themselves in you, they're going to be in trouble. And if it feels internally like, oh, I could, I would like this too. Then the only way for them to want someone else is for them to be done or dissatisfied with their partner. Yeah. It's really not, as you pointed out, it's not at all the same for people who are truly polyamorous. Yeah. So talking about it for that long was incredibly painful for me. But when it did come, you did come to break up, it didn't feel maybe quite as bad as some breakups could. You just felt like you were ready and that was, it was time. Oh, I felt like I had this boot off my neck for the first time in 15 years when I left him. I felt like I could take a deep breath again. Like I could really be who I was and not nearly as concerned about him and what was he doing and how was he going to twist whatever I said into me suddenly agreeing to something else I didn't want to do yet again. Yeah. And I didn't want to do it. And I felt like I was the master of that. So how did you maintain contact with him? Because of course you had children together. Did you maintain some kind of amicable communication? I tried really hard at that. I put a lot of effort into being a positive co-parent and as long as it only went one direction, he got what he wanted from me. He was fine with that. I was fine. I was fine with that. But if I had to blame him for something, he would say, you cheated on me. I can do whatever I want to you. Which of course is not true because if you're poly, then there is no cheating. No. If you've discussed it and negotiated it. Well, I broke his one penis policy. I never even got to have sex with that other guy because he was so freaked out about it. But I kissed him. I wanted to be with him. So according to my ex, I was outside of the bounds. And you know, tricky. He could do whatever he wanted to me. So and it's interesting that with a breakup, the all the issues that were problematic for us in our original relationship were problematic in the breakup have stayed in the divorce too. So I'm still he's fine with me bearing the discomfort of whatever kind of thing that we have and him taking as much as he can from me. His relationship has remained ** unraveled **. And I got to my point to the point where this is justamente like that. Like all the things that we've topped ideas which we are helping each other, the one we struggled with and what we haven't \u2013 that we haven't talked about. There's just sort of to head off back to your life and statistics, and that could ribs me away because it's for natural reasons. What grabs your time to type. How do you perceive things and act? How do you create an outcome and focus? How can we grow our relationship? It is something we have to adjust to. So I'm still in the process. He was like, no, we're divorced. You cheated on me. No. So it was a very one-sided even then. So now I don't speak to him. Okay. But my children now are old enough that I just speak directly to them. I see. And have very positive, strong relationships with them and just don't. I interact with my ex as little as possible. And we do interact occasionally. The children interact with both of you? They have a relationship? Yes. The children mostly live with him. I see. Like I let him move to California with them and didn't even oppose him. Okay. And didn't sufficiently negotiate because I was trying to have this positive relationship. And they have a happy, positive relationship with him, even if you don't. I would say yes. Yes. I mean, for the most part, he's certainly a decent dad. Yeah. Okay. Especially financially. He's got a lot of money. Way more money than I do. So he could give them a good life in that sense. And not only gives them a good life, but actively uses it to manipulate them and to get them to do what he wants them to do. Okay. But let's kind of fast forward because we do want to come to your sort of happier, current situation. So much happier. So much happier. Which interestingly is another kind of monopoly-ish scenario. Yes. You're sort of monogamous person who seems to be drawn to people who are non-monogamous. But actually, now your current situation is working really well. Great. Because we let each other do what we want. Neither of our, whatever either of us are doing is dependent on the other one. We're not each other's bait. We don't have to be together doing anything. So my wife is just a very charismatic and flirty person who when like if she's on the dance floor, she's 21. She's permanently 21. If she's in a club and she's hanging out, she is a lively, interactive. Very charismatic person who likes to interact flirtily with other people. And I don't know why it doesn't bother me to tell you the truth. Well, I know at least one reason it doesn't bother me is because I feel really well loved. Yes. By her. I know she loves me. She treats me like she loves me. She tells me she loves me, not just in words, but her actions. And everything about her. I'm so much more secure in that relationship with her because of the way she treats me far more than I ever was with my previous partner. Well, sometimes we do have negative experiences in order to learn and move forward into a more conscious, compassionate and collaborative relationships. Absolutely. And he really liked me being one down. It gave him a lot. He liked me having more control. He liked that power imbalance. Yeah. Which, in your current situation, it sounds so much more equal. It does. It feels much more equal. It feels much more loving and supportive. Yeah. So if she's flirting with someone else. It's okay. Yes. I'm secure enough in our relationship and I feel like I'm not lacking anything with her. Yeah. That I'm not kind of looking in the back. For more something where I always felt insecure with my previous partner. And he kept it that way. He really liked it that way. I do think. I mean, obviously, we've talked about a kind of poly experience that was pretty difficult and traumatic. But I do think. I mean, I meet so many people and you will have done, too, that polyamory has so many great values attached to it that I do think we can. Absolutely. Kind of import those into monogamous relationships. Yeah. Or monopoly or all kinds of different relationships. These ideas of communicating properly and respect one another and so on. And being able to negotiate. Yeah. What you want and what your needs are. Exactly. And independent boundaries for each relationship. Not having to do it just one way because that's the way everyone else has done it. Yes. I mean, I do see a sort of kind of see a bit of an intersection between. Yeah. Polyamory and some of the ideas about conscious uncoupling or breaking up consciously. And this is kind of something I've been interested in a lot. And I wrote a show comedy show called The Conscious Uncoupling. And because I was in a relationship that I guess maybe we realized that we weren't completely meeting one another's needs. But was that Jen? Yeah. Jen in my book. But there was a whole lot of really good stuff there. So I think. For me, if we were going to end it, it was much better to do it in a very conscious and collaborative way that that maintains some kind of a friendship. And, you know, in a kind of slower way. And that did coincide with me investigating non-monogamy and some of the ideas around it. And it was interesting. I watched recently and we won't discuss it too much because it could be a whole other podcast. Louis Theroux did a documentary on polyamory, which sort of had its good points and its limitations, shall we say. And one of the questions he asked one of the one of the women involved in the documentary was, isn't it just slow divorce? And I thought that was kind of interesting because I do know couples where they've opened up their relationship and they have broken up maybe a year or so later. But I think in some of the cases I've seen, it's not because polyamory was a disaster. It was because the relationship maybe wasn't quite working, but actually taking on board some poly values has helped them to sort of have quite a. A kind of. Ethical breakup, if you like. Absolutely. And it's not always divorce for people. Some people, especially some of the couples and trios and moresomes in my study, have been together for decades. Absolutely. It is not always slow divorce. Oh, absolutely not. It can be a whole world of other things. But even in the occasions where perhaps it is something a little like that, I don't necessarily think that's a terrible thing. If you if you decide that you're going to break up. Rather than having one day of screaming and never speaking to each other. Right. That you are going to unwind things in a fairly collaborative way with with discussion and and so on. Thank you.",
