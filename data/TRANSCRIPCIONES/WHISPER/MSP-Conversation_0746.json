    "text": " Silently, in the dim and unfamiliar air, we unloaded our things. Plastic trash bags packed with clothes and sheets and towels. Cardboard boxes filled with dishes wrapped in newspaper. A cooler crammed with bars of soap, bottles of water, cooking oil, and shampoo. During the drive, we had passed a television set on the curb, and when he saw it, the driver braked hard and backed up. You want it? Arturo and I looked at each other in confusion. The television? You want it? Take it. Arturo said, It's not stealing? The driver snorted. People throw everything in the United States, even things that are still perfectly good. Later, when he stopped again and pointed to a discarded kitchen table, and later again at a mattress propped up like a sliding board against someone's mailbox, we understood what to do and loaded them into the truck. After we carried everything up the rusted metal staircase to our apartment, after we found the key the landlord had left for us, taped to the floor, and taped to the threshold of the door, Arturo went back down to pay the driver. He gave him half the money we had. Gone. Just like that. The driver put the bills in his pocket and flicked his cigarette out the window. Good luck. I heard him say before he drove off. A selection from The Book of Unknown Americans by Christina Henriquez, interpreted by actors with Portland's Teatro Milagro. We heard Shanika Tellis reading the part of Alma. Maribel was read by Monica Dom\u00e9nech. The part of Arturo was read by Ahai Tarazas-Trapathi. And Giovanni Alva was the truck driver. Author Christina Henriquez is going to visit Portland next week with a Tuesday night lecture for literary arts and a visit to OPB's Think Out Loud. If you can't go, just catch up with us next weekend. We'll bring you some of what she had to say. Christina Henriquez has said that when she was trying to find her writing voice, she was deeply influenced by Sandra Cisneros' 1984 novel The House on Mango Street. The story of a girl trying to escape her low-income neighborhood in Chicago. It's a classic, widely read in college classrooms and book clubs. And it's one of the few novels from a Latina perspective to be embraced by the literary establishment. Cisneros' subsequent novels and nonfiction have further explored Chicana identity and the experience of straddling cultures, drawn from her own childhood, traveling between Mexico and America, the only girl in a family of six boys. We spoke with Sandra Cisneros in November, and she was a great listener. She wrote a book called The House on Mango Street, which was published in November at Wordstock, shortly after the release of her newest book, A House of My Own, Stories from My Life. I wanted to ask you, since the book is so intimately concerned with home matters, people might be learning in this book for the first time that you're living in Mexico. Yeah. Tell us why you moved there. Oh, lots of reasons, but to put it briefly, I moved to a place where it felt like home. And home, I think, should make you feel safe. You know, I liked the people there, both the expats and the native people, and I felt kind of at home with my two languages. And it just was a town where you could walk around and give away your car and just feel at home walking. And I needed something like that. I'd grown up in big Chicago, and then I lived in a big military town, San Antonio, Texas. And I just didn't fit in. I'm a woman who's 60 this year, and I don't have kids, and I can't bear where we are right now as a country in a kind of military state that we're living in, in a warrior state. I feel so sad about that, so I just wanted to go somewhere else. And I know this sounds crazy, but I feel safer in Mexico than I do in the United States. Why? Well, for one thing, I live in a community where I'm not alone. Why? Because, you know, I'm a woman, and I'm a woman who's a woman. And I can't help but feel so much hurt when I'm with my family, or with my friends, or when I'm with my friends, or when I'm with my friends. So I've been in a community where I'm mainly surrounded by people who watch out for me. And I do think that's a real thing. I think it's a real thing, but I think there's also a real thing where people watch out for you, because one of my big fears is that I'll die and my pets will eat me. But that can't happen in Mexico, because people are always knocking on the door like, you know, . They're always bringing stuff, so you can never be dead for too long. And for another thing, it's like, all the neighbors are always watching out for you. Everybody always looks out for you. have a home and to be part of the community in San Antonio. And the readers get treated to the inside scoop on some of that. Yeah. And I almost considered moving here to Portland. Yeah. That was one of my options. I was going to like finish my book and then scout. And I had Alpine, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Corrales, New Mexico, Santa Fe and Portland as options. In all the places you were looking for, I mean, how much were you looking around just to see how people live together? Well, I didn't get to the search part because once I was in Mexico, I felt so happy there that I just said, this is where I belong. You know, it took me a little bit of time to move my fear out of the way because I think when you have fear, you don't have clarity. That's what the issue that we're having in the United States right now. We're living in such a state of fear that we're not seeing things clearly. And our leadership is not seeing things clearly. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. are stoking that fear. So it's not a good time. I just, I feel this really, that emotion of fear when I cross the border and come north. And I know that sounds odd, but I feel it when I come here. When I go south, of course, I fly directly into the central part. I don't go to the northern regions. And I may be fooling myself, but I do feel more secure in Mexico. Mexican society is not without its own struggles. Yes, that's right. How would you describe that dynamic? What do you see happening there? Well, one of the things I see in Mexico that is very uplifting and hopeful is that everybody's disgusted with the government. It's kind of like, you know, from the taxi cab driver to the woman who does your hair to the lady selling tortillas. Everybody's disgusted. Nobody trusts the government. It's a great unifier. Yeah, that unifies everybody. And nobody trusts the newspapers or the media. And I still feel like in the United States, we're still innocent. You know, we're still innocent and hopeful. And believe what politicians tell us. And, you know, I've been voting for 30 years. I'm just in this place of like, you know, I think it's time to write poetry because that's the opposite of politics, you know, to write the truth. Politicians always say what you want to hear. And when you start writing poetry, you come to a truth. And I just have felt impotent in this time. And I don't want to be, I don't want to feel impotent as a writer. So I need to write poetry to decide where to go next. What does it mean for a writer to step away from the community where most of your readers are? Well, I don't think of that. I think that as writers, you always step away from your community. Anytime you pick up your pen, it's a kind of bipolar existence. You know, you go away by yourself and you find your little convent of one and you write. And then you come out. If you're an author, then you have to go out and be a comedian and P.T. Barnum. And stand on your head and entertain people and sell books. It's just this opposite existence. So I don't really see it as very different, you know, except maybe I found a town where I can retreat and go into sanctuary, as Ursula Le Guin said. I just saw Ursula Le Guin in the green room, but I was too afraid to go up to her, you know. She's like this shining emerald. And I just sat in a corner and thought, oh, my God, Ursula Le Guin. So I just sent her love and light to Ursula Le Guin from across the room. She's amazing. I wanted to go hear her, but I had to take a nap so I could be awake and alert to talk to you. Sandra Cisneros, refreshed and ready. Her new book is A House of My Own. It's been a real pleasure to meet you. Thank you for talking to us. Thanks. That's Sandra Cisneros. Her latest book is A House of My Own, Stories from My Life. We talked to her at Wordstock last November. You know, for all of Portland's kvetching, about the thousands of people moving to the city every year, people do get awfully uptight when someone actually leaves town. Stand-up stars Sean Jordan and Amy Miller are about to make the leap. They're both moving to Los Angeles this month to pursue their comedic careers. Next Sunday, these two will do one last gig called Amy Miller and Sean Jordan's Friendship and Pizza Party, joined on stage by a who's who of Stumptown stand-ups and rock musicians. Amy Miller has packed many, many gigs into her three and a half years in Portland. She organizes the Midnight Mass Comedy Showcase. On stage, her style is serving up deadpan turnaround takes on Portland, on guys, girls, and all flavors of awkward. Here she is during a set last year in Portland. I just had my 35th birthday. Yeah, dude. But for some reason, it was this weird milestone for me where I finally accepted that the window has closed in my life. On me ever being like a trophy girlfriend for someone, which is a crazy thing that we all want as young women. I just know I'm never going to be the subject of that conversation, and that's fine. I'm not a trophy. To be honest, as a woman, I'm a little bit more like a Stanley Cup. You know? Yeah. More impressive to Canadian men. Yeah. I'm like... For whatever reason, like, everybody that wins it is missing teeth and has an anger problem. I don't know. I don't know what that is. That's Amy Miller on stage last year. She made a splashy appearance in 2015 on NBC's Last Comic Standing.",
