    "text": " Hey everyone, it's me, Arthur Cade. So Brittany, I was just complaining to you, although complimenting, you have a great show, but kept me up late last night. Between you and Outlander the night before, I'm like, I need sleep. So as soon as we're done this, I'm going home. No, congratulations, great new show on SyFy. Your character, badass. I mean, she is no joke. Talk to me about the show and this really interesting character. You have no idea what's going on with her. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I play Alison Regan and she is one of the key members at this place called the ETU, which is stumbled upon by the lead Finn Carroll. And so this character is trying to find his wife. He finds us an underground task force for the government and we're hunting down aliens. And my character is one of those aliens. And so it's off the bat, very complicated. And yeah, I mean, the show is really, it's an allegory for what's going on right now in the world. It's interesting. I think it's accessible in that sense because it is under the umbrella of science fiction, which I think definitely lends itself to be able to talk about a lot of issues that we have to tackle on a day-to-day basis. You know, the unknown and fear, really. I love the surveillance part of it. That is so cool. There's a movie out right now called Eye in the Sky with Alan Mirren and Aaron Paul, where you get to see all these little gadgets of surveillance. Then I'm watching your show and I'm like, they know everything. You've got to have a... Oh, yeah. You've got to have a... You've got to have a... You've just got to be having a blast on set with this because the production value on it, it's movie-like. Thank you. It's great. Yeah, it was amazing. I mean, our prosthetic supervisor, Justin Dix, is a legend. And we were able, as actors, it's so awesome when you actually get to hold something physical that you're going to be working with. And I think we used a green screen only a couple of times and everything was practical. Practical prosthetics, practical, you know. And it was just a pleasure and a joy. And I've always loved toys and I always... And I love tech and I love... I love gear and it was... Yeah, it was awesome. This is a huge transition for me. Obviously, the ABC family thing before it and now you're moving up to sci-fi. What's that transition been like for you, moving from essentially family-friendly content to, you know, CIA agents that are animals? Definitely. Well, I think, I mean, I started out on Skins and that was very controversial at the time, U.S. Skins for MTV. And it's been really... I forgot about that. Yeah, that and then I did American Horror, the second season of American Horror Story. And so I've kind of been... I've been really fortunate to be in this genre, in the supernatural genre for a while now with The Flash as well. And it's kind of been seamless and also just a pleasure to be able to go from doing something like Ravenswood for now called Freeform, ABC Family. And that was amazing because it really touched upon the supernatural and then going to doing superheroes and supervillains and now doing aliens. It's... I couldn't... I couldn't ask for more, really. Was this something growing up where you're like, I love sci-fi. This is where I'd love to see my career go, kind of a Sigourney Weaver type path? Yeah. I mean, I never really thought that I would have the pleasure to be able to be in film and TV that I myself as a child would have loved to watch and did watch. I mean, the first live action film I remember watching was the original 456 Star Wars. And I grew up on anime and I grew up on playing video games with my brother and so on. And I would have had no idea that I would be in this position back then, especially because I was a very shy child. But again, it's just been such a pleasure. Speaking of Star Wars, have you seen the Rogue One trailer that came out today? I just saw it this morning. Awesome, right? And it's awesome. But I have no... Like, I just... It's... We'll see what happens. Because, I mean... Star Wars is very special for me and it's very emotional for me. For all of us, Brittany. For all of us. And so to see it for the first time... For all of us. For all of us. For all of us. For all of us. There are so many questions and so many things that I want to know. And it's before the first film, the original first film. And it's very exciting. It's so exciting. It's fascinating because we see with Star Wars, Rey, obviously, with The Force Awakens. Now Felicity Jones is leading this end of the franchise. You're the lead on your show. We're seeing these strong female characters on action TV shows and movies. Talk to me about playing a strong female character like that. Because really, the show does revolve around you. Thank you. Yeah, I think it's a really awesome time for women in the industry. And especially now that what was deemed as weird or nerdy or uncool back in the day is now so accessible. You know, you have comic book film franchises. You have it on TV as well. And, you know, people every day I see walking down the street wearing Flash t-shirts or what have you. And for a female... And for me, it was just a part of my life growing up. You know, that's being in this world and loving it. And it's amazing to be able to continuously play strong females. I think I've been very fortunate in my career, the five years I've been doing this, to play a lot of strong women. And you're seeing that more and more. And I think that's awesome. I think it's empowering. And it's also paving the way for chicks to be like, yeah, I'm a nerd. And it's freaking awesome. And I love it. And I love what I do. And that's empowering. What drew you to this show specifically? What drew me to the show was the fact that I'd be working with Galen Hurd and Nellie Chides. I mean, they've got pretty good shows under their belts. They've got pretty good shows. Yeah, you know, The Walking Dead. It's like a pretty good TV series. Might make it. Yeah. Twelve Monkeys might make it. Twelve Monkeys is amazing. Yeah, great show. And for me, I mean, one, again, I was going to be working with incredible women in the industry, which is becoming more of a theme, I think. Again, as time goes on. But that was huge for me. Also, the fact that I was going to be able to work in Australia for an extended period of time. And I'd always wanted to go there. A vacation. Yeah, exactly. You know, not that I really saw much of it, unfortunately, because the schedule was crazy. But and also the fact that it was supernatural. I love Sci-Fi Channel. I've always loved Sci-Fi Channel. And the script was phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. So how could I not want to go out for it? You also have a movie at Tribeca coming up as well. Yes, I do. How exciting is that? Talk to me about the movie. Yeah, it's really exciting. It's called AWOL. And it's a film following Lola Kirk's character. She's a heck of an actress, by the way. She's amazing. She's a heck of an actress. Yeah. And she's such a lovely, cool person. And I play a character that she sort of comes across along her journey. And may or may not show things up just a little bit. Do you enjoy movies or TV more? Because obviously with TV, there's the arc of the character. And you can really build it out. With a movie, especially indies, your 18 days in and out, whatever it is, what's more enjoyable for you as an actress? That's a really good question. It's kind of a complicated question. They're both so different. TV is this fast-paced train that just moves whether you're ready or not. And it's a grueling schedule. But at the same time, especially with indie films, which are the ones that I've done, you're working on a lower budget. You're working with a group of people who are so incredibly passionate about this thing. And it's their baby, just as TV is. But a lot of the times, the stakes can feel a lot higher. So creatively, with indies, what's been awesome, the small roles that I've had in them, is having a character and really being able to build it and then just put it on and let it go. And then with TV, really having that arc. So for me, I just, I love playing. I love what I do. I love being able to be an artist for a living. And I'll take whatever I can get. Really, I love both. I love both. Hunters is everywhere in New York, by the way. Is it blowing your mind? I took the train and I live in Williamsburg. I think I saw 18 different Hunters ads on buses, in the subway. Is it blowing your mind? Sci-fi seems to really love the show and be behind it. Yeah. I mean, I remember when I was in the 80s, I was like, I'm going to be a part of this. I'm going to be a part of this. I'm going to be a part of this. I remember when The Expanse was just about to come out and the same thing. It was everywhere. And it's kind of crazy. It's been a while since I've been a lead on a show. So I kind of had to take a second look and I was like, oh, wait, Hunters. That's mine. That's mine. That's, I'm going to do that. And it's really cool. I've taken pictures of all of the buses and it's really awesome to be able to share that with my family as well because they're all back in Canada. And so sending them pictures of that. And it's awesome. And I love being on a channel that really is passionate about the material. So yeah, I mean, it's totally weird and it's a thrill. What's the training like for this show? Because you guys, it seems so real from you to the rest of the cast. I mean, even the way you're carrying the guns, it seems like there's a tremendous amount of training that was involved. Yeah, we definitely had weapons training, which was awesome. All of us together, me and the guys. We separately worked with... We worked with stunt coordinators on certain things. I did a lot of boxing and kickboxing, which was awesome, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which I love, which is good to know. I can write that on my resume. And yeah, I mean, it was definitely intense. I mean, I got to Australia a week before we started shooting. So I just dove straight in and tried my best to gain a little bit of muscle mass beforehand because I'm usually a slender gal. But for me, I mean, the physical aspect of the show and of the character and being a hunter is something that really drew me to the project as well because I have a physical theater background and a dance background. And to be able to really put your body into a character is amazing and something that I missed very much. I can't wait to see the rest of the show. This is one of those where I wish they would have sent me literally the first 10 episodes because... And this is what happens with me. I just watch through the night and they'll scream at me when I come in and be like, you look so tired. And it was like 1 a.m. I'm like, I could keep going with this and I'm stuck on it. So congratulations. I'm really hoping this is a huge hit for you guys. Congrats on your terrific in it.",
