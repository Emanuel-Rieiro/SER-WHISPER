    "text": " Well, the first thing to notice is it sounds like it eventually wants to become the most basic kind of token, right? Which is an IOU1 token. So the network decides, however it decides, that you've made a contribution that deserves to be paid in some way and they gave you a token. And what's that token good for? Well, that token, what you've just told me is that the token would be used to buy things like sponsorships and other services on the network. So the token is really just the network telling you, hey, you know, you did a good thing for you. I owe you one. And someone gets a token. And if they want something that the network provides, they can redeem it back to the network effectively. They can give it back to the network and the network will provide a service that the network can provide. And so that's a source of value. And the value of the token in terms of exchange value. So one way to get value from the token then is just to, well, I want to, you know, some advertising or, you know, some sponsorship from the network. So I'm going to just use my token for that directly. But another way to get value from the token would be exchange value. Well, I don't really need to have, you know, to have my name on the network, but somebody else might want that. So I'll sell the token to them and they can use it for that. And so the exchange value of the token will then depend in a pretty direct way on how much people value the services that the network can provide, that use value. So it's hard for me, you know, I wouldn't be able to do a valuation analysis of the token. And that would be like, you know, trying to end if the main service the network provides to people for the token is something. Like, you know, sponsorship advertising, then it would be like an analysis, you know, of the advertising value of those slots. And I'm sure there are lots of, you know, advertising analysts who would be able to model, you know, how much is this kind of sponsorship or this kind of commercial or whatever the service would be. How much is that worth? Once we model that in aggregate, once we found out, okay, well, sponsorships are worth this much and there are this many tokens out there. You know, then we can start thinking about. What the use value of the tokens is. We can kind of put a floor on the use value of the token by kind of imagining that all the tokens are going to be used for sponsorships. There are some tricky things about thinking about how the flow works, what happens when the tokens are paid or they redeemed and disappear or they pay to other people. There are details in there. But fundamentally, we have a basis for coming up with sort of fundamental valuation of the token once we find a source of value. That would be more of a. Floor than a ceiling because. Not, you know, some people will hold tokens simply to hold them. And to the degree that people use tokens as a store of value. That tends to in an unstable way, but at least for a while, you know, at the margin, be supportive of value. So we see that a lot with Bitcoin where lots and lots of the Bitcoin issued is not made available for sale or not used in transfers. And the value of Bitcoin is high. Higher than it would otherwise be if all Bitcoin that had ever been mined was actively circulated. I think it's kind of a mistake to rely for most tokens to rely upon that kind of value as a source of value. It's the only reason to really bring it up is to say that the fundamental values are kind of floor. Things can go up for speculative reasons and store of value reasons. As I mentioned in the talk, if I were the if I were the network, if the value of my tokens went very far above. What I thought the value of my services could justify if the application allows it. And I hope that it does. It's smart for token emitting applications to allow it. Then the network should actually sell more tokens into the demand and use the proceeds of that to do things that will enhance the value of the network over time. Right. So you should think of think of the token as like a stock when a firm stock is very valuable. If they're smart and they think that that value might be transient, they go on buying sprees. They issue stock to acquire other firms that offer assets to them that will increase the long term value of the firm rather than relying on a potentially unstable high valuation to keep their token valuable. They take that potentially temporary high valuation and convert it into permanent, real economic value generating assets that then support the token from the bottom. That increase its fundamental value. So that would be the kind of thing I would think that a network like LTB might try to think about and consider building into its model so that like a traditional business ought to do. The odd thing is, is that in the traditional finance, this notion of using the issuance of tokens, the issuance of stock in particular, as a way of raising funds on an as needed basis. That's really the most fundamental idea of equity finance. But it's almost completely blocked. By a kind of regulatory sclerosis. So really, you know, public stock markets are not used to raise money. They're used to distribute money to people who were already claimants or the people who bought stock from people who were already claimants before firms went public. On net, public stock markets are distributing funds, not raising them. So in the crypto asset community, we really have an opportunity to kind of redo an understandable but lamentable historical. Path where this idea of you generate value, people get excited about your tokens, and then you use that enthusiasm and that evaluation of the community that you might potentially be able to do something valuable to sell the tokens and purchase real assets that are going to turn your dream. Maybe people are just buying a dream. Great. But you're going to turn your dream into something real and solid, a thing that creates economic value. And that requires real investment and, you know, resources and humans and arrangements. Yeah. So that. That becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy in a kind of way where the high valuation might be ephemeral, but you convert that ephemeral high valuation into a sustainable long-term high valuation by, as you said, selling into the demand and then using that, you know, newly invested capital to actually invest in things that will improve the long-term value and perhaps support that speculative high valuation. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. So I wouldn't. I wouldn't want to say it's self-fulfilling because most of the time it won't be fulfilled, right? Most businesses fail and most great ideas, whether they just seem great and they're not really so great or whether they're awesome but very difficult to execute. You know, people will get excited about lots of things. And even if people are, you know, selling and buying assets, they might make mistakes. There's never going to be any guarantee. And most speculative enterprises are probably always going to fail. But that's why, you know, when we are on the other side of it, when we are investors or speculators or we're just putting together our portfolio of things we want to hold, we need to be thoughtful about what, you know, dreams we buy into and what dreams we don't. So hopefully the tokens that have those, you know, real bouts of speculative enthusiasm are tokens for which at least the dream itself is a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. token crowdfundings that have generated a lot of money, and that's great, and people will do something with it. And if history is any guide, certainly more than 50% of the time, people will do their very best with that money, and it just won't work out. That's a great distinction. I appreciate you making that clarification. Another thing that we discussed briefly was this idea of using Demerage as a way to maybe head off inflation in a token that's being issued. If the token isn't being issued forever, but instead it does have a cap in the way that LTB coin does, is Demerage as important, or do you still see a role for Demerage in limited supply currencies? Oh yeah, I see a role for Demerage particularly in limited supply currencies. So the problem with a limited supply currency is that it really privileges people who get in and out of the market. So if you're in a limited supply currency, you're not going to have a lot of money. So if you're in a limited supply currency, you're not going to have a lot of money. early when they're cheap. So you say, I'm going to start a limited supply currency, and at any given moment, you're limited supply currency, great, it's limited supply. There are only 100,000 tokens out there, but it's today, I just started it up. You can buy 10,000 for a dollar. And then all of a sudden over time, whatever the application or collaboration or business or whatever it is, is going to be undergirded by actually succeed. So sometime in the future, all of a sudden, these tokens are really valuable. They have an important value. But early on, lots of really sort of cheap speculators who didn't do much contributing to the actual value of the enterprise, just get wildly rich for nothing. And you might say, well, okay, well, that's great. Why begrudge people their luck? Well, it happens in the stock market too, right? I mean, early Apple investors, might have just sat on their laurels, and now they're billionaires. Yeah. So it certainly does happen. It happens in any market and in any financial market, any speculative market. And to a certain degree, that's fine. We want for people to be able to, it's okay for people to be able to get lucky and get rich. But it's also not really so fine if the things people get rich from are too disjoint from the things, that people do to provide value. So in Apple's case, for example, Apple never issued a fixed token. And there was always, there was, in fact, during the 1990s, a very significant possibility that early token holders would be entirely diluted out, right? So what happens with a traditional firm is when there's the event called bankruptcy and reorganization, the early token holders basically have their tokens devalued usually to nothing post reorganization. Apple has the right to continually issue shares if it wants to. It doesn't want to so much recently because it has so much cash. And it doesn't do it so frequently. It might do acquisitions from shares, but it doesn't issue shares for cash very much anymore. Because from a regulatory and also cultural perspective right now, issuing new shares for cash and secondary offerings, it's just not done. Okay. So in that case, then maybe you're saying shares, the idea of shares is not done. It's just not done. And shares in companies doesn't map kind of one-to-one to a fixed supply currency. So yeah, they're not fixed supply. And the important thing is, and they're not sort of the best thing in the world. The real early investors in Apple did supply a service that was really important, which is that they were willing to bear a lot of risk for something that at the time was totally, you know, nothing. And certainly early token holders sometimes do that as well. And so there's a role for equity-like tokens that aren't issued very much in order to incentivize people to make, you know, large bets early on with something. But most of the tokens that I think we're talking about, we're not really asking people to take large bets. You know, the crowdfunding model early on is asking people to take small bets. And mostly what we want to do with the tokens, as I understand with the LTV token, right, is we want to encourage people to actually perform, to do things that add value to the network. So your primary role as a, as a token receiver is not to be bearing an enormous amount of risk in exchange for a lottery ticket against fabulous wealth. That's one model. And it's an important model in the real world. But another model is to say, well, we're issuing tokens because we want you to actually provide value directly to our enterprise. And so we're going to pay you in tokens for the enterprise. And if that's your model, then these lottery ticket, this lottery ticket-like behavior is deeply counterproductive. Because as a new entrant, right, no matter what I do, I can contribute a thousand hours of work to the network. But somebody who contributed two hours of work to the network in its fifth day is going to be rewarded lots more than I am. Right. And just by holding onto those shares and watching appreciation, it just doesn't well align the incentives of people to contribute with the rewards from contribution. To just kind of have a fixed value token and let people's reward be a matter of happenstance about at what price they purchased that token. Right. So with something like Demerize, you can say basically, look, here's the deal. We want to basically pay people in tokens. And we know how much value we're trying to pay people. We want, you know, we want a certain contribution, say a blog post. You know, we want to reward you for a blog post. With something that pretty much matches the, you know, the sponsorship value or however we measure the value of the blog post. And we can put a dollar figure on it. You know, we want to pay you something that's, you know, worth, you know, maybe a hundred dollars for that blog post. A nice way to arrange that is to try to stabilize the value of the token so that for the blog post, we're going to just pay you a certain amount of tokens. But that amount of tokens has a certain amount of value. So we're going to just pay you a certain amount of tokens. value that you can understand. Well, if you're constantly issuing tokens for new things, how do you support that value? Well, one way that you can support that value is you can say, look, and holders of older tokens are going to have to give up some of that value, right? We're going to actually take some of those older tokens away or Demerize. We're going to over time, fractionally decay older tokens to make room for new tokens to be more valuable. And the net effect of that is we're basically saying we value current contributions a little bit more than old contributions. So as you get a token, it starts out with a value and you can, you can sell it now. But over time, that value is going to dissipate. So you might say, well, why would anybody ever hold a token that's going to evaporate forever? Well, that's where you really have to think about, does the token have some kind of value from holding? So if the token pays a dividend or something like that, right, if you distribute that fundamental value, it's created from the blog post by issuing a dividend from sponsorships or whatever it is that you're using to generate some economic value, some exchange value from your network. Well, then people hold the tokens, not because they expect them to appreciate, they know actually their token's going to decay over time, but they're going to get a dividend stream that starts out high and decays over time. And it's that dividend stream that's going to define the value of their token. And so when you decide how much to pay the, for the blog post, you're going to put a value in that dividend stream and give them the dividend stream that maps to a hundred dollars and nobody gets screwed because everybody got paid exactly the value that they expected. And it's just that that value gets paid with a stream of payments that starts out high and goes down over time. And the number of votes remains fixed. That's a really interesting idea. And there's a lot of things that I could say about it, but unfortunately we're out of time today, but I would love to have you back on in the future, Steve. To talk about crypto asset valuation and some of your other interesting ideas about how to use cryptocurrency and smart contract technology. Thanks a lot, Steve.",
