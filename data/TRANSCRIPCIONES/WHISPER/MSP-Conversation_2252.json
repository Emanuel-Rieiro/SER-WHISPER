    "text": " the cgi on captain marvel just looks so good yes yes these so both of these movies i mean like you can i mean you know we've we've gotten used to like okay obviously that's cgi but like there were times where i was like she actually like glowing on fire and these so captain marvel comes out in march and then infinity war i mean avengers endgame comes out in april and both these trailers yeah both these trailers dropped this week so i'm kind of we're just skipping around with them a little bit but i have to say i love that the new avengers movie is called avengers endgame i think that's very very like it's a very comic book name it is and i love it and i saw a tweet the other day about um or yesterday about how it sounds like a what someone would title a uh 300k like slow burn avengers fanfic and i'm like yes and i love it i mean yeah yeah yeah, but yeah i watched the the captain marvel trailer i'm so excited for nick fury um young nick fury is very exciting um yeah i like that cgi on that looks really good too it's really freaking me out and i mean even in uh even in captain america civil war um seeing young robert downey jr blew my mind because he was a young actor so they did have like that footage and like like were able to recreate it but they just did such a good job that i was like whoa he's so young yeah yeah he's a young baby yeah little baby but i i also like that they give uh captain marvel her mohawk in a few scenes yeah i noticed that too yeah i was surprised because i thought they wouldn't uh go for that in this movie yet so that was very cool yeah well i think it's just her helmet i'm not sure but maybe if like the helmet like gives her a mohawk sort of it was it looked like it looked like the helmet had like a like cut out of it so that her hair was like sticking through but like yeah it was short enough that it looked like a mohawk i don't know we'll see know we'll see but it's just cool because i know i wonder i wonder if that is footage from like the present time so like maybe in the 90s her hair is longer and then she gets the mohawk in like present time after nick fury in infinity war sends out that message yeah and i don't know nearly as much about captain marvel as i wish i did i just kind of always knew her as like she was kind of like not as i guess kind of a side character because i never read any of books that were just about her like she was always kind of an extra character in the background that was doing badass stuff and so that's it's kind of like with dr strange how you were mentioned that like oh yeah he's that weird spooky uncle that just lives in the mountains and everybody goes visits everyone yes i love and i'm like yes that's exactly how i feel about him too it's like i love dr strange in the sense that he is a character that exists in the background so people are always going to him but i like that more of having him on the periphery instead of him as a main character um with captain marvel i'm more familiar with ms marvel so my introduction to captain was like seeing her as this kind of like very big like hero almost not messiah necessarily but like reputable like figure of like heroic stature that ms marvel like admires and also has like similarities to and stuff like that so i'm excited to see what captain marvel's backstory is in the movie and then maybe look at the comics like the comics and see what's going on in the comics and then maybe look at the comics and then maybe look at the comics and then maybe look at the comics and then maybe look at the comics of that afterwards because i want to i kind of want to go into the movie like blank slate and just yeah me too like i keep yeah i keep wanting to go out and buy every captain marvel comic there is but at the same time i'm like i kind of want to do that after the movie which is normally not how i approach things like especially if there's like a movie that's based on a book that looks really good like i have to read the book before yeah this time around i'm like no i kind of i think i'm just gonna have to give it a try but yeah i think i'm gonna try and see what happens yeah so i'm very excited i might even come drive over yes please please please please please please do we'll have we'll have the brussels sprout pizza and it will be great what i love about like comics movies they're really interesting because unlike book adaptions where i feel like i do need to read the book source material first with comics movies there's so much that they leave out or different takes that they take on the character is that it really feels more like a alternate timeline than a like than like a shot for shot like representation of what of what the comics will be so true yeah because with comics you have so many different authors and different interpretations oh yes it's like whenever there's a movie you kind of just blend everything together and pick and choose and even when i'm reading comics i just kind of choose what i like best and ignore what i don't we talked a little bit about that last last episode but if you are looking for captain marvel comics i've heard really great things about them i've heard a lot about them i've heard a lot about them i've heard about the life of captain marvel it's a fairly new mini series talks about like her past and apparently it's supposed to be very um it'll make you very emotional at captain marvel so it's a i think it's a mini series it's maybe only like five issues or something i think it's all released now um so it may even be in trade pick back now that would be really handy yeah the life of captain marvel so i definitely want to check that out after um after the movie so i'm very excited for that i love that nick ferri loves cats just like this is very good it's gonna be a fun new side of him that we haven't seen yet i already loved him in um captain america was it civil war or was it winter soldier where he hung out with i haven't seen either of those since they came out in theater so i think i think it was pretty sure it was winter soldier he like comes to comes to steve's apartment and then like they get shot up and um yeah i think so but if you told me that it was civil war i'd be like oh yeah that makes sense i believe you like information on a flash drive in the in the vending machine so or or captain america it's like that i think that is yeah because it's in the it's in the vending machine when when nick fury gets anyway that i i really enjoyed his role in that movie so i'm excited to see more of him as a character because he's kind of always been like the mysterious like boss figure but avengers end game looks very fun as well and i only say fun because i love scott lang and i'm so excited to see him like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like back with the avengers yeah um he's definitely the comic relief now that all the other comic relief characters are dead so and i really loved ant-man and the wasp so i'm excited to see that stuff pay off even though it's kind of a bummer like evangeline lily's character yeah is dust also but scott lang is great so excited to see him yeah i was so happy to see him in the trailer i was like thank god cracking some jokes he's gonna be the only one who's like joking and i'm also like my dude like you lost all of your family probably so maybe we shouldn't be as as as happy as we are one of my favorite jokes in ant-man and the wasp is when he's talking with evangeline lily uh hope and he he says like yeah well like cap needed my help and she's like cap and he says uh cap captain uh captain america we call him cap and she's like are you friends now is that is that what this is yeah oh bless big old nerd so i had some other about sabrina on netflix but i don't even know if i want to mention it because i'm on such a marvel i know um so pretty much there there's a christmas special coming out i don't remember what day it's coming out maybe it's coming out next week but it's like a little mini episode and that's the thing and then season two is coming out in april and trailer for that came out and it looks way better than season one awesome and since i don't know since i mentioned it a lot i was like oh i guess we'll talk about that too but that's not really i mean it's comic books it's just not marvel yeah that's exciting though that it'll be um better than the first one it's nice because i guess the first one was a little more set up but it's it's it's yeah i mean i don't want to get i don't want to get into too much like spoilery stuff with season one but basically the way i'll sum it up is i felt like the big finale of the last episode kind of made the whole thing a little bit more fun and i think it's definitely a little more fun to watch i'm not sure if the trailer is going to be like the whole season pointless so i was like well that's kind of dumb but like season two the trailer i was like okay this is what i was expecting the show to be so now i'm actually like excited so i don't know so what are we talking about today carol we're talking about x-men and i feel like i need i need i need like a glass of wine but it's it's like it's like 11 a.m so i can't i can't do that oh man okay well this is okay this is another big general topic that we're gonna try and just yes very general with and then maybe later we'll have specific episodes yes for sure i am like i would love to have like a wolverine episode oh yeah you can have an entire episode just talking about him same here i as i was figuring out what i wanted to talk about in this episode um and it took me like two weeks to to try and like like get it down i got down so i want to just kind of do a brief like over sweeping um thing about about x-men because i love x-men um actually the way that i got into it it's my gym jam but i'm actually fairly new to the x-men verse um you are an excited pedia of x-men by now i am i am but it's hard but it's only been like a year and a half since i got into it because i so speaking of wolverine with the logan movie that came out in 2017 which seems like it felt it feels like it came out forever ago but it came out last march can you believe black panther came out this year i don't what yeah wait 2018 has been a very long year oh my god okay hmm yeah that puts me on the right track yeah that puts me on the right track yeah that puts me on the right track yeah that puts me on the right track that puts things into perspective wow so logan feels like even longer yes yes and logan is logan is very good but i remember seeing it and i had enjoyed the the wolverine movie um that was just called the wolverine where he goes to japan and i i so rewatch so watching logan i was just like amazed by the performance and like by all the actors and the story and the the tragedy of it it's very very cool um and so then the day afterwards i uh went like to my friend's house and we just marathoned the first three x-men movies uh the third one was bad but when i watched the second x-men movie with um that's the one that has nightcrawler in it i was first of all i was kind of bamboozled because my friend was like when he showed up on screen she was like oh yeah doesn't he have like he's like weirdly obsessed with storm or something so i got it in my head that they were like a canon ship or something like that because they have very good chemistry in that movie they really do i was like oh hello they do i was like oh my god i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited they do alan cummings and heli berry do such a great job and like it's that movie also just in general is very good jackman's really great in it too they do they have like bedroom the scene before he bamfs into the uh false um cerebro and she's like telling him like that she has faith in him and he just like looks at her with his like big golden eyes and i'm just like i'm shook what um i'm sure but i really like i i did like like hold on to those characters and so that kind of just after watching those movies i wanted to watch the prequels and get into the comics because i was really interested in these characters and i started um reading the storm mini series by greg pack that was back in uh 2014 because i had a few issues from it because i remember buying it at a comic shop when it came out but i hadn't read them yet so i went back and read them and i was like oh my god i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited i'm so excited and just dove into the comics verse and everything so and now here i am and now this is where i am but now i have like a greater appreciation for a lot of different x-men um and and not just kind of like my faves but i've been keeping up with the comics now and it's it hasn't been very long but for this episode i do want to do a more general sweeping the original mutants and like like so let's we'll just see where this comes in and then i'll be back with the next one goes yeah so like let's pretend people have been living under a rock and they heard of x-men and they've heard of wolverine they've heard of listen maybe maybe it's maybe you know 2016 and they haven't seen logan yet so they're not that into x-men i was there once too so so let's just like give a very generic teal deer of this kind of yeah mutants they have a mutation in their genes that makes them mutants and it either like gives them superpowers of some kind or and or changes their outer appearance normally um it's it's either superpowers or both superpowers and um a mutation like they have blue skin and pointy ears and a tail or they have like they're green and spiky and have like a big arm or maybe they just like become this globular like i don't know pink blob thing with a skeleton inside but the thing is that they're all humans but just with a genetic like mutant gene and sometimes the mutation doesn't come out until they are like 12 or something and sometimes they're born like it yeah and often when it comes out when they are like in like prepubescent uh either they their appearance does start to change or they start developing like psychic powers or something but from what i've seen a lot of times if if people are born like just like you're born as a baby and you have you're like look weird then like you are a mutant like nightcrawler was born and he was blue and had pointy ears and a tail yeah and there are a lot of different series that draw from this i'm not sure like what came first or whatever but they all the all the students it's basically like a big boarding school at the xavier uh school for gifted youngsters um similar to harry potter or boku no hero or whatever yeah yeah pretty much yeah because i found this out while i was researching this and uh it's something that i didn't know so when they were coming out i was like i don't know like oh yeah i'm not sure who the one that was going to be the one that was going to be the one that was going to be the one that was going to up with x-men i mean like you know stan lee and everybody um they basically yeah they basically came up with the characters first so they're like let's have a guy that shoots lasers out of his eyes let's have a girl that can read minds like they came up with all that stuff first and then they were like well where do they get these powers from and then they were just like uh what are they were just born with them again so i was like oh i didn't even know that that's cool they kind of went backwards so actually a funny story that i just realized that i think you will be really amused by okay when i first i don't like i've always known about x-men i never really got introduced to it it just was like always there and i i feel like wolverine's kind of like the poster child like he's like the main mascot i guess and i thought that his claws were his mutation i didn't know until way later that his mutation was healing mm-hmm and that's how he even gets the claws in the first place because it's like oh he'll just heal himself like yeah i had no idea i was like oh i thought he was born with these claws right like the claws are a part of it but they he's also is like an experiment so they weren't always part so i was like oh that's crazy but so if if anybody else also same same here when i was like younger and i guess like in in the old school tv show um i was just like well cyclops has laser beams mm-hmm and he can never open his eyes without his glasses which fucking sucks and then wolverine has big claws and he's just reckless um but it's actually that he can literally become like a skeleton and regrow his flesh and stuff but he wasn't an original yeah he was not he was not an original but he is definitely the uh the the fan favorite and for good reason i mean he's he's a fascinating character and i love that he's literally five foot nothing um sometimes sometimes i see that he's five foot three and i'm like oh my god he's like five foot three and i'm like oh my god he's like five foot nothing my short man what's up yeah um but he i read a quote about i was reading an article about turtles uh teenage mutant ninja turtles and it was talking about rafael and how rafael is the wolverine of the turtles whereas he's the he's the fan favorite of that group um but the original the original five is kind of what they're called of the x-men um are all x-men that did not look necessarily different from other people except for angel i guess so it's cyclops marvel girl aka jean gray uh ice man angel and beast and beast at this point wasn't big blue and hairy a la kelsey grammar and everything else um but those five i didn't really know that they were the original five until i started getting back into the comics and reading uh more recent stuff like the uncanny x-men run by brian michael bendis and all new x-men where the younger the original five young x-men come the past into the present they're like transported there by older beast um and so through that i was able to learn more about the original five because they are their original kids at xavier's school they're their original students and just kind of having the classic adventures of um agnito's up to his stuff again we gotta stop him we're also we don't really know how to control our powers we're all teens and there's a girl on the team and everyone has a girl yep she can read your dirty thoughts and she's like i'm surrounded by idiots no she's like a good girl but there's um it's interesting because with the movies that's how most people i think i don't know of like mainstream oh definitely comics first were introduced to it and so what i think of the first like the main uh x-men crew would be wolverine storm cyclops and uh jean gray basically yeah just those kind of all the like the adults and at least in the original and that's definitely how they had it set up they were like okay you're the like the original yeah and here's all the new younger characters coming into the school for the first time and so that's why it's always like i always forget that wolverine is not in the original yeah he was never really a student i mean they were all students but when they first came i don't think he showed up until after this was he was it like like a big one or was it a big one like a the school i don't think the school was like a thing yet when he showed or maybe it was i think he shows up later i mean by the time he shows up because he with his healing powers he also ages very slowly so by the time he shows up he's been around he's been around forever yeah and and i mean when when storm shows up and like colossus is one of the kind of original mutants too they seem to be adults but they are also strictly students and then it's interesting to see the over the course of these decades of comics how now that group is are the teachers and they are no longer the students",
