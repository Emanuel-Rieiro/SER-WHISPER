    "text": " I support Speaker DeLeo's changes to close loopholes around background checks, particularly around domestic violence. We filed an amicus brief the Supreme Court decided this week to support the federal authorities' opportunity to enforce the gun sales that are straw purchases. That is a problem at a national level, not so much at a state level. And I certainly have spent a good deal of my life looking, as I think Dr. Berwick has said, some of the root causes of violence and holding people accountable when they use weapons there's two classes of people who shouldn't have them, when they're illegal and when they're not stable enough to have them. Steve Grossman. So I would sign Bob DeLeo's bill, think it could go farther. But I need to ask you, Martha, since we're talking about guns, the governor has proposed since 2007 one gun a month. This has been proven in the past. One gun purchase a month to try and hold down mass purchases and straw purchases. Well, to reduce the number of guns. I mean, nobody needs more than one gun a month. That's 12 guns a year. Unless you're trying to arm a militia, I don't think you need to buy more than one gun a month. And I just don't understand, Martha. The governor proposed this when Virginia had one gun a month back in 1993. Doug Wilder signed it. There was a 72 percent reduction in the use of guns from Virginia in gun-related crimes. Why won't you join the governor and accept and support one gun a month? It seems common sense. This is the position. This is the position the NRA has taken. I think you've asked the question. Let her answer it. Yeah. And I guess I don't understand why you don't understand, Steve, because I have worked in this field for a long period of time. I get an F from the NRA on this issue. I think we need to focus on passing legislation, as Speaker DeLeo has, on the issues and the problems that are a problem for here in the state. And we have problems with illegal guns and people who are unstable to have them. It's not the issue. And I think we should be focusing, as we have in Massachusetts, on our own gun laws. The federal authorities need to get rid of assault weapons, and we need to keep illegal guns out of our state. No more or less than that. Well, the fact of the matter is that we have an opportunity in our own state to do things that are going to reduce gun-related deaths. Virginia didn't have the tough straw purchase laws that we do. They had a reason to pass those laws in states like many of the southern states where those illegal guns come into our state. So I'm glad the federal government is going to crack down on that. All right. Out of fairness, Dr. Berwick, where are you on this, limiting the number of guns that can be purchased a month? As I said, I'm for the one-gun-a-month rule and would make it even more stringent. All right. Let's move on. And by the way, in John Rosenthal and Stop Handgun Violence, they're probably the most authoritative organization in America on this issue, are 100 percent supportive. This is going to save lives. Fundamentally, Bob, this is about saving lives. All right. Let's talk about another area where lives are at risk. Another concern right now for both law enforcement and public health officials is the growing opiate abuse problem in Massachusetts, which New England governor has addressed at a meeting here in Boston. This week, a recent WBUR poll showed that 52 percent of likely voters consider the abuse of heroin or prescription painkillers a major problem in the state. Thirty-one percent go further, labeling it a crisis. What specifically do you want to address the opiate problem, Steve Grossman? Well, the first thing I do within my first month in office as governor would be to issue an executive order and suspend prison construction in the state because, frankly, we are going to spend a billion dollars. Between now and 2020, building more prisons. There are way too many people who are guilty of low-level drug offenses sitting in our jails, sitting in our prisons, and we've got to change that. We've got to take that money and use it for building more detox beds, more step-down units, more recovery units, more community-based care like Hope House in Dorchester. We've got to treat this epidemic, this crisis, as a health care issue and not as a criminal justice issue. That's the first thing I would do. There are other things I would do as well. I would like to bring. More behavioral health counselors into public schools. There was a study just done by the federal government. It said that 13% of the 12 to 17-year-olds in Massachusetts have used an illegal drug within the first month that the study was done. 13%, more than one of eight 12 to 17-year-olds using illegal drugs. So we've got to start with our schools, more awareness, more education, to bring that to children when they're 11 and 12 years old because it starts right there. Dr. Berwick. Dr. Berwick. I've set out some very bold goals that I care about with respect to disparities in our society, the end of hunger, the end of homelessness in this commonwealth, and one of them is a 50% reduction in the next five to eight years in substance abuse and suicide in the commonwealth. We can do it. I've seen it done. We need to think globally. There are programs that work in this country and abroad. I've worked with those programs throughout my career. I want to bring them here. This involves also decreasing access to the gateway drugs, the pharmaceuticals that are now being used and actually calculated. They need to be used to get people hooked on them. Well, I want you to give me one example of a program that you think does work and would work here. Well, there's a wonderful organization now called Shatterproof.org that Gary Mandela started. Mr. Mandela, who was a hotelier, his son committed suicide, addicted to marijuana, and he has now left his former work and he's started an organization that's working on statutory reforms, outreach and consumer awareness, destigmatizing treatment, and drug treatment. And he set that goal also, a 50% reduction. I think we can do it. Martha Coakley. We do have a crisis, and I've seen this since I started in Lowell District Court in 1986. Too many people, for sometimes mental health issues, other reasons, become involved with substance abuse, both alcohol and drugs. But what has happened is that we have seen, and Dr. Berwick referenced this, a use since OxyContin, high-grade, very addictive prescription drugs that people start using themselves or take from their parents' medicine cabinets. It's used recreationally. And, in fact, we have had pharmaceutical companies that push these drugs for a profit, and they're gambling with our health and they're losing. And so we now have portions of the population that are 30% or so of people use those drugs are likely to get addicted to them. We have to stop that. We have to control doctors and pharmacies and look at the way they are prescribed, make sure that they're not diverted. And this is going to take a multi-pronged effort, and I'm glad to see that the governor signed an agreement with other states so we can work on that diversion. Across the New England region, Peter Schumlin in Vermont has said it's a crisis. I know from my colleagues in Kentucky and California, epidemic proportions. Would you go after the drug companies in some way? Yes, I would. How? We did when OxyContin was being used. We forced, from statements from the DA's office and the AG's, have been after the drug companies to make them in forms that are not crushable, that they're harder for people to divert. And so I think they have responsibility. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. approved medical marijuana law. Certainly there have been numerous problems with the applicants, Martha Coakley. I think we're not doing very well at all. I'd say we're doing disastrously. What do you want to do about it? Well, I think that as we've seen, if the public decided medical marijuana, and certainly everybody agrees people who have pain management issues should have access to it, but this has to be done in a way where we vet the applicants. You're going to have a lot of cash. You're going to have drugs that are still illegal on the federal level. And there are a lot of complications, I think, in terms of the neighborhood locations we have not thought through. We haven't vetted the applicants. I have said, and I think that, and I believe that the administration is doing this, has gone back to take a look at it. Do we scrap the process and start over? I had suggested that we do that. But you don't think that'll happen? I'm not sure what's happening right now. Okay, Steve Grossman. Well, we passed this pretty overwhelmingly as a ballot question because the people of Massachusetts understood that we had a lot of problems with the medical marijuana law. And I think that's a good thing. That people with cancer, glaucoma, other illnesses that are giving them tremendous pain, nausea, et cetera, that can be dealt with using medical marijuana. So I think the people of the state said yes. But I think the people of the state know that this has been implemented abysmally. I mean, it's just been an abject failure. That's what leadership is all about. You can't just have a vision for what you want to do. You have to be able to execute. And we executed this poorly. And whether we start over again or simply go back and re-vet, the fact of the matter is people feel unfair and done poorly. And that gives us a black eye, those of us in government. So under a Grossman administration, do we start over, scrap it, or re-vet? Well, if we can re-vet and keep this moving quickly, I mean, it's been a long time since the people of the state, people have said, do it now. It was passed as a ballot question a long time ago. And we still have nowhere near the implementation process. So whether we re-vet or start over again, we've got to do this right from the very beginning. That's what leadership and good management is all about. That's what executive leadership is all about, I should say. Dr. Berwick. Well, I'm a physician. I've seen how, for some patients, for nausea and pain, marijuana is the only option. And so I support medical use of marijuana. But this process was done wrong. I think we need to go through the vetting process again. And this is basically about public trust in government. I'm a progressive. I'm proud of that. But we need the public to trust the government to carry the ball on some of the really important and bold changes we need to make. When something like this happens, public trust erodes. I've worked for 30 years on excellence in organizations, how that happens, how reliability happens. That's what I've practiced, learned, and taught. And I want to bring that to the corner office. All right. I want to ask a very quick question here on legalization of marijuana for recreational use. This is a very quick answer. In favor of it or not in favor of it? Talk to Berwick. I want to watch what happens in Colorado and Washington for a couple of years. We'll have the data then, and we'll know what to do. And Martha Copeland. Same thing, not yet. And Steve Groskamp. I agree with that position.",
