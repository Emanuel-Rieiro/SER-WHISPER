    "text": " Hey, this is my podcast, and I have Ash Navabi. Is that the right way to say it? Yep. Okay, so we were talking online, and I was going to answer you, and then quite often if I take the time to answer, I'll post \u2013 I'll do a blog post about it because then other people can read it too. So I figured we'd just chat. So you had an interesting question I thought. Anyway, tell \u2013 where are you? What's your \u2013 are you a student or where are you? Yeah, I'm a master's student in economics at George Mason University. Ah, got it. Okay. Oh, do you know Daniel Rothschild? Yeah, I just met him in math camp over the summer. Okay, okay. All right, cool. Yeah, he's a buddy of mine. Yeah, I see you guys interact on Facebook sometimes. Yeah, we went to Porkfest together this year. So did you get a chance to read the blog post I sent you? Yes, I did, and it clarified things. So quite a bit, I think. Let's just go through it then. So why don't you read your question, and then I'll tell you what my approach would be, and you tell me if that makes sense or if you have any other questions about it. All right, so the exact question I said was I'm having a conceptual problem distinguishing intellectual property and tangible property. In Against Intellectual Property, your book, you said that an IP right gives an IP owner, quote, invariably transfer partial ownership of tangible property. In Against Intellectual Property, your book, you said that an IP right gives an IP owner, quote, invariably transfer partial ownership of tangible property. In Against Intellectual Property, your book, you said that an IP right gives an IP owner, quote, invariably transfer partial ownership of tangible property. From its natural owner to innovators, inventors, and artists, end quote. But doesn't this apply to every property right? If I own attractive land, why can't we say that if I ban you riding across it with your dirt bike, then I am claiming ownership over your dirt bike? Right, and it's a good question, and I think it's based upon several sort of presumptions which are built into the way we commonly talk about property rights. in today's society and even among libertarians. So let me just kind of systematically tell you my approach to that issue. And the posts I gave you were about a similar argument that's made, which is that when I point out that the problem with intellectual property is that it limits what people can do with their own already existing property, the common retort is always, but every property right does that. In other words, your property right in your face or in your nose prevents what I can do. I can't do with my fist, for example. So they end up trying to twist it back when you say that all property rights are limits on other people's property rights. And so then I guess the argument is, so what's wrong with limiting property rights? But by that argument, you could justify anything. You could justify someone is attacking someone with no cause, and the victim complains, and you say, well, what are you complaining about? No property rights are absolute or something like that. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. There's no end to where you could take that, so you end up invoking property rights as an excuse to limit property rights. It just makes no sense. There's one aspect of intellectual property that actually does make sense, and that is the conceptual \u2013 and this is something most people don't understand that aren't specialists. A patent right, for example, doesn't give you the right to make the invention that you have a patent on. It only gives you the right to stop other people from making the invention. So, for example, if I patent a \u2013 let's say someone has a patent on a four-legged stool. So they are the only one who has the right to make that stool, or they can prevent other people from making a four-legged stool. And you come up with the bright idea of making a three-legged stool. Now, let's suppose their patent is a stool having a plurality of legs. Something like that. So that's their patent. It's a broad patent. Now, you come up with a patent for a three-legged stool because it's more stable and it doesn't rock back and forth if one leg is different than the other or whatever. You might be able to get a patent on the three-legged stool, but you wouldn't be able to make the stool because that might infringe the first patent. So the point is an IP right doesn't really give you the right to do something. It gives you the right to stop other people from doing things. And in a sense, I think that's what regular property rights are too. For example, if I say I own the right to a handgun, it doesn't mean I can do whatever I want with the handgun. It means that I am the one who has the right to control it. I am the one who has the right to give permission or to deny permission from other people. I can loan someone my gun. I can sell someone my gun. I can give someone my gun, or I can prevent them from using my gun. So in a sense, property rights are like a negative right. It's just I'm the one who can prevent other people from crossing. That boundary. It's not an absolute right to do whatever you want with it. Now, the way libertarians put this usually is they'll say you have the right to use your property in any way that you want so long as you don't harm someone else. They'll put that sort of limitation on it, and that's functionally the same thing. But in reality, you never had a right to use your fist to punch me in the nose. You never had a right to use your gun to shoot me. You never had a right to use your motorcycle to ride on my property because\u2026 \u2026 the right to the motorcycle is simply a right really in abstract form. It's a right to prevent other people from using that motorcycle. But that \u2013 so that right, that negative right would never have given you a right to cross over my land in the first place. So that's like legally how I would conceive of that in the first place. Is this related to the notion of estoppel? No, it's got nothing to do with estoppel. Estoppel is more like just a way to justify the libertarian rights framework that we have. So that's a \u2013 this is more just analytical, like analyzing what rights are. Another aspect of that type of analysis is sort of the Rothbardian combined with St. Mises and Hoppe, the recognition that, number one, all rights are property rights. Rothbard points this out in Ethics of Liberty, but he doesn't dwell too much on what that means, and this is \u2013 if you unpack that with reference to Mises' praxeology and Hoppe's political theory\u2026 \u2026 what that really means is that all rights are property rights. And all property rights are property rights to control a contestable, scarce resource. I mean that is what property rights are because, if you think about it, all property rights are an assignment of an exclusive right to use or, in my negative way, the right to prevent other people from using something that there could be conflict over. And they're potentially enforceable. That is backed up by force. So all these things are bound up in the physical world. We use physical force, maybe backed up by the legal system or the community or even your\u2026 \u2026 in terms of self-defense or self-action that protects your \u2013 the resource you want to use. So all enforcement of rights is physical force. They're always aimed at a real conflict. The real conflict is always a physical squabble over some real thing. So property rights just are a right to a physical resource. So when it comes to intellectual property, what I think \u2013 I think it's literally impossible. It's impossible to own an idea, for example, or a recipe or information. It's not just that I oppose it morally. It's not just that I think the legal system is unjustified or socialistic. It is that it literally is not what it claims to be. It is not a \u2013 no legal system in the world can actually grant property rights in ideas because all property rights are rights to scarce resources. So it's basically a disguised way of reassigning property rights in existing things that can be the subject of property. So just as a crude example, if you own a copyright in your novel, what that really means is that the law is granting you a legally recognized right in some of my money. Because you can go to court, and the court will use physical force against my physical body to compel me to pay you some money or to compel me not to print on my paper some story. So really it amounts to a reassignment of rights. Now, you could say, well, all property rights are legal. All property rights are just the ownership of some resource by an owner, and therefore intellectual property is no different. And that is true. It's just that the property rights are not assigned in a just way. So the libertarian view is we have a set of basically three and exactly three and only three rules for determining who the owner of a resource is. And this is where estoppel might come into it if you wanted to go to a justification or argumentation ethics or consequentialism or intuitionism, whatever your approach is, or utilitarianism. The basic set of libertarian rules is, number one, the idea of \u2013 well, in a way there's four because I was going to say original appropriation, which is if there's an unowned resource, then the person who is the first one to start using it and put up borders around it basically to establish a connection between them and the thing by mixing their labor with it, for example, you might say. That person has a better claim than anyone else. Unless one of the other two things happen, which is contract or restitution or rectification. Yet sort of the parallel to that rule is self-ownership. That is body ownership. You also have a presumptive right to control your body. That's not really original appropriation because your body wasn't lying around unowned and you homesteaded it. So there's a different basis in my view for your ownership of your body. But so you could say that libertarianism has four rules. Number one is body ownership. Presumptive body ownership. Everyone owns their body because they have a better claim to the body than others because you have direct control over your body. That's sort of the Hoppean analysis. But in terms of external resources that were unowned, we have three rules. One is like Lockean original appropriation. So the first owner \u2013 the first user has a better claim than others unless you, as the owner, transfer ownership to someone else by a rental agreement or a contract. Or a sale or a gift or a donation, something like that. So basically you can transfer ownership to someone else, and then that person would be the best owner of the thing with regard to the rest of the world because from the rest of the world's point of view, this person has a \u2013 no one else is an earlier user of the thing. The only person who's an earlier user would be you, but you contractually gave it to them, so you don't have a claim against them either because of your particular contract. And then the third. The third case would be a case of like if you harm someone in some kind of crime or tort, then you owe them compensation, rectification, or restitution. In such a case, someone might have a claim on some of your resources in compensation for the harm you had done them. But using those three rules, you can identify the owner of any scarce resource in the world. And in the motorcycle case, in the land case, you can't just say\u2026 The owner of the motorcycle has a complaint against the landowner because he can't use his motorcycle to ride on the land because the question is what's the disputed resource? In this case, the disputed resource would be the land because the motorcycle owner wants to ride it on the land. So now we have a dispute between two possible people over the ownership of this land. Who gets to use the land? It's irrelevant that there's a motorcycle involved. I mean you might want to walk on my land with your body. You might want to shoot cannonballs into my land from your land with your artillery. You want to use my land in some way. You want to alter the physical integrity of my land in some way. I don't want you to, so we have a conflict over a scarce resource, which is what property rights always are about. And so the libertarian approach is to consult those three principles. Who was the first owner of the land? Who acquired it by contract? And does anyone owe anyone rectification for some kind of tort they've committed? Now, in the example you gave, I'm assuming that the landowner hasn't harmed the motorcycle owner. He hasn't committed any tort against him. He hasn't stolen anything from him. He hasn't invaded his property borders in some kind of way, so he doesn't owe him any kind of recompense. He didn't have a contract with him. He didn't say, I give you the land, so there's no contract. So then the question comes back to who has a better title to the land? And presumably, if I'm the owner of the land, I either was the first homesteader of the land. Or I acquired it by contract from someone else. So the question is answered by resort to those principles, so I'm the owner of the land. And so that's the libertarian approach. The only other approach would be some deviation from those rules, which is what socialism always does. Basically, socialism always ends up endorsing a rule that the current owner of a resource is the three rules I mentioned plus another rule. Unless we \u2013 the third rule is that the current owner of a resource is the third rule. Unless we \u2013 the third rule is that the current owner of a resource is the third rule. Unless we \u2013 the third rule is that the current owner of a resource is the third rule. The democratic majority or unless the dictator decided to take this from the existing owner, which is theft. We just call that theft. So I think there's no conflict between property rights, and the two blog posts I sent you is an attempt to explain why there's not a conflict between \u2013 why property rights are not limits on property rights. Property rights actually are the assignment of the right to decide who gets to use a given resource. Anyway, that's my attempt to explain that. That was very good. Does that persuade you? Do you agree with that? Does it make sense? No, I \u2013 yeah, I 100% agree with that. To me, it was just when I was reading your book, it was unclear where you were going with that passage. And I understand now that you said a property right is \u2013 somebody asked \u2013 it's conflict over a scarce resource. So we have to understand what is the resource. It's the resource being conflicted over, and in the case of the motorcycle and the land, it was the piece of land. And in the case of IP, it's usually some scarce resource. Yeah, it's either the body or the warehouse or the material of the person who's being limited by the IP law. Exactly. And in terms of libertarian theory, my view is that the nature of conflict and the nature of disputes is what helps to identify what the resource is. Because if \u2013 you don't have a question unless there's a conflict. And when there's a conflict, then there are two people who want to use something in an incompatible way. They have a dispute about it, and that very dispute usually highlights the nature of the thing that's in question and helps to identify its boundaries and what the resource is. And in this case, I would say it was the land. It wasn't the motorcycle. Yeah, that's excellent.",
