    "text": " It's this movie that I believe is on Netflix. And I know I mentioned it to you before once. It's actually a LGBT movie. And I thought the plot was interesting. And the way that they handle kind of hard topics, I guess, was really nice. Like, it is a comedy, but they don't make a comedy about, like, the serious things. What is it? It's called Alex Strangelove. Oh, okay. I haven't seen that. Yeah, and I don't know what it was. It's like I heard about it. And then I just got bored and I saw it on Netflix. And I was like, okay, I'm going to check this out. And it's essentially about a guy, Alex, and he's a high schooler. I mean, it's a high schooler coming of age story. And, like, it starts out and it's like he meets this girl in class. And they become best friends because they like all the same stuff. And then they've been friends for, like, four years. So they end up dating once they get to, like, senior year of high school and stuff. You know, it's this kind of, like, basic everyday high school. High school dude, right? And kind of as it goes along, like, he meets this guy. And then he starts to realize that, like, he has feelings for this guy. And then he gets really confused because it's like, because the story is like, well, you know, I really love this girl. Like, she's my best friend. And I really do care about her and love her. But the girl is ready to, like, you know, sleep with him. And he's, like, not really enthusiastic about it. But he's confused about it. He's like, why wouldn't I be? Because I love her and all this stuff. And it's just. He sort of realizes that he, like, stumbled into the relationship because that's how it works with the series of events. Not because. Yeah. Yeah. He was just like, oh, well, we're, like, 17 now. So I guess we should start dating. But it's, like, he really does care for the girlfriend character. But it's just it's a different kind of love, I guess. And it's just it's really interesting. And it has, like, a happy ending and all that stuff. But it's, like, you know, like, they have. Real arguments that make sense. And it's again, it's like it is a comedy, but they don't. It's not like there's not like gay jokes or anything in it because it's it's just it's a very it seems like a very honest movie of just like just different kinds of love, like. Yeah. Romantic love and friendship love. And it's just I was like, oh, this is such a sweet movie. Like, I didn't expect it. And it was just it was it was very good. And I definitely recommend it. Cool. Yeah. I definitely want to. Like, check that out, because I like I like that more movies can have or rather. I don't know. I guess I hope that more movies can kind of take that step to be to show that there are different kinds of love and different levels of that. I'm watching this Netflix series right now called Sex Education. It has Gillian Gillian Anderson in it. And it's about, like, teens in high school. And it's wildly dramatized and funny. But I think it's really well written and has, like, pretty colors and stuff. One of the main characters is, like, freaked out. And he does not really have a sex drive. And he's like, what's wrong with me? And he's like 17 or 16 or whatever. And the whole time I'm watching it, I'm kind of like, my dude, you're asexual. Like, I think you're ace. But I don't. But the problem is that I don't think the movie I don't think the show is going to go in that direction because ends up meeting a girl who he likes. And then he kind of like has, like, sexual feelings for and he's like, oh, this is it. But I'm like, I, I want to see more representations of queerness and things that people. Like, it's not like rather teens coming to realize, like, hey, I don't have to conform to this, like, like, step by step process of, like, how to be a teen and like, like, like, have a crush. Go on dates, like, start dating. Like, and like, I have to, like, I don't know, be in a relationship with someone by this age or et cetera, et cetera. Having that unsureness and people realizing that, hey, I don't maybe want this and that's okay. And I want to explore. There are other things that I might want. I like that. I hope that more movies and shows have that kind of narrative in it. And I'm glad that you really like that because I want to check it out. Yeah, I was a little anxious about it. No, it's, it's, it's very good. It's, I, like, I can't recommend it enough. After I watched it, I would just had so many, like, fuzzy feelings for these little teenagers, you know, figuring things out. And, and it's all very natural. Like, like, I feel like the, the actor, the main character. Like, he has chemistry with both, like, the girlfriend and also this guy that he meets. And it's just, it's all very natural. And he doesn't, like, I mean, he's, like, awkward or whatever, but it's, he doesn't look, you know, stereotypically gay or something. And it's just something that, like, just kind of blossoms naturally over the movie. And I'm like, this is nice. I like that it kind of, from what you're telling me, it sounds like he's, it's, it's ambiguous. But in a way that it's, like, he's trying to figure it out. Like, he doesn't have to be gay or straight or, like, explicitly bi. He's just like, this is me and I'm figuring out what I, like, want. Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, it just essentially is, like, you know, he started dating this girl that he was best friends with and did, like, I feel like, I think they had, like, a YouTube channel or something in the beginning of their friendship and all this stuff. And it was just, like, they were hanging out every day. And it's, like, he obviously cared for her a lot. And it just ended up that, like, it wasn't, like. He didn't sexually, wasn't sexually attracted to her. But he still, like, loved her in a different way. And I think it's just important to see that, especially in high school. It's, like, you can love people in different ways. It's, ah, so good. I love how modern that is with that they, like, they had a YouTube channel. Like, wow. Like, that just pinpoints, like, ages the movie, like, so perfectly in its time. I just, it's so funny. But, like, it's very cool to see more exploration. And, I don't know, just more, like, a variety of stories in new rom-com stuff rather than the mainstream things that we had in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. It's, like, I really like those movies that I grew up with. But I'm also, like, they're all very similar. A lot of those are the same stuff. Which is, I like some of that stuff. So I'm, like, hey, fun. But, hey, there's way more other things out there that we could be focusing on or, like, exploring in. Yeah. Romance genre. That actually kind of leads me. Into my next answer of my favorite, like, 80s, 90s movie. Yeah. That was my intent. Yes. So, I mean, I was born in the late 80s. I don't really remember the 80s. But I do have a fondness for 80s movies and 80s pop culture and stuff. Because 80s movies, especially, like, teen movies and coming-of-age movies, it's slightly familiar to me. And yet still very foreign. Because I wasn't a teenager in the 80s. Yeah. But, like, I remember a lot of, like, the remnants. So the 80s and the early 90s and stuff. The problem is, is that as I got older, a lot of movies just do not age very well. Mostly what I'm thinking of is I love John Hughes movies. But they, yeah. They're, like, yeah, they're classics. And then you watch them again. You're, like, mmm. Oh, my gosh. That, yeah. Molly Ringwald, actually. Yes. The actress who is in, she's the redhead in Breakfast Club. And a lot of his other movies. Yeah. She wrote an article recently, maybe a handful of months ago, about how she is now a mother. And she actually is also still acting, which is very cool. It's fun to see her in different shows. But she wrote an article about how. She is on Riverdale. Yeah. Oh, she's the mom. It's wonderful. She is a mother of, like, I think a preteen right now. And she wrote an article about how she came to terms with the idea that her child might see The Breakfast Club now. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would want them to see it and how it's very different. So, especially in the Me Too era, there is this one scene where she's sitting at her desk. And I guess the teacher comes in. I can't quite remember. But the bad boy that she ends up ending up with is underneath the table hiding. And she's wearing a skirt. And he sticks his face in between her knees. And there's a panty shot. And it's very, something that would be extremely. like gross and wrong now and also like is looking back at it so specifically like talking about that scene she wrote an article about it and how it's just the perspective like the optics of it have maybe not shifted but definitely like come into focus yeah it's just like some things just do not age well and it's important to be able to take that with a grain of salt and like especially when those movies are so idealized yeah it's it's like i still have a lot of fondness for a lot of those movies like if you just take away all the not so good moments like there are moments that i still love about it and like classic things about it but like i can still acknowledge like hey those movies aren't as great as i remember them for sure actually i'm at but um i do have one movie that is from the 80s that i don't remember really any problems with and i saw it pretty recently and it's kind of the same way that i like alex strange love and that it's very it's just it feels very real it doesn't feel like the characters are tropes or anything or or it's very 80s or anything and it's um the movie say anything which um is a lot of people remember it as the movie with the scene where the guy has the boombox yeah i almost said that i almost said hey yeah the boombox movie yes and and and, but no that that because like i'd always known about that moment and i never actually knew the movie behind it and so i watched it and because you see that and you think like oh the guy like totally screwed up and and and she dumped him and now he's trying to get her back or whatever and it's actually not like that at all i mean it's it's kind of a typical oh he's kind of a like he's not a loser but he's kind of an underachiever and she's like the valedictorian and she's like super strong and she's like super strong and she's like super strong and she's like super strong and she's like super strong and she's like super strong and she's like super strong you know but kind of looks\ufffd\ufffd and funny and skinny and tired and treated like this is just super funny and pretty creepy and i find that that's\u3084 like a pretty interesting firsthand so i i think i i myself both i i've thought god knows could be a good thing even though i've never watched the movie because like at home i'm like oh my god yeah somebody's acting pretty or helpful i'm i like a\u99ae instead of i should just get a movie like they're fighting they're explicit and but i it's is like her dad or whatever her dad's like you don't have time for a boyfriend you have all these like things you have to do for college and all this stuff and so like they kind of break up or whatever because she feels pressured that she just doesn't have time for a boyfriend and all this stuff and so that's why he started playing that song outside of her bedroom and it's just it's very sweet and like he's there's no there's never a moment where like he does anything that's super creepy or like a jerk or anything and I was like oh finally like I don't have to feel bad rooting for him because he does something horrible there are so many male leads in like mainstream rom-coms that are just assholes or just like I'm like why am I supposed to like this person at all actually the other night I watched PS I love you which I like Gerard Butler all right um so I was like oh this is on Netflix I'll watch it it does not age super well some of it is good but yeah Like like very quickly there was like a transphobic joke in the beginning of it or rather it's like it's like I'm just like I'm uncomfortable and then one of the characters that she's like maybe gonna end up with is just just like jerk who's just like he's like rude and there's just like some mental health things that I'm like okay side eyes it's a lot anyway but I'm like why why are these like men I like I don't like them they're not even nice they're just like smarmy and it's it's very very upsetting. And like, while I am kind of like, okay, how typical the like, valedictorian versus loser boy, like, it's never like the loser girl and the valedictorian boy. Typically, because it's like the jock and the like, shy, awkward girl, but she's actually like, hot on the inside or whatever. Anyway, rom coms are littered with tons of like, cliches that are not often very good. But you can still like, like some of those stories if they're done well, like, two cute, awkward kids. I haven't seen say anything. But after hearing you talk about it, I'm like, maybe I want to I want to watch it. Yeah, and it's not very long. It's a pretty short little movie. And I just remember like, whenever they would have, you know, arguments or whatever to create the conflict of the plot. They were very understandable arguments. Like nobody really came off as a jerk. It was just kind of like awkward situations. And oh my gosh, teenagers and I was like, okay, this like, I understand both sides. So this felt like a very, yeah, and it just felt like a very real relationship. And it was just really nice. And I just I mean, I like I said, it's been a few years, but I just distinctly remember watching it and being like, Oh, I don't feel so grimy watching this as I do if I watch, you know, 16 candles again, which I really can't watch anymore. Because it's just it's too bad. I actually God, okay. You mentioned that, like, set me back in time. I had never seen it in my youth. But I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I watched it with one of my great old, like babysitters who is very close to my age. She's only about eight years older than me or so. But I remember watching it in high school, because it was one of her favorites growing up. And we watched it. And we were just like, Oh, boy. Yeah, it doesn't age well at all. And there are some really gross scenes. And I'm just like, what the fuck? There was also like, nudity at some point. And I'm like, Oh, my God, I remember being shot because I was in high school. And also like, these people are supposed to be high schoolers. I think it's like the girls in the locker room or something. And they're showering. I'm just like, Oh, yeah. Right. And I'm like, these are supposed to be underage girls. Also, anyway, it's just a whole smorgasbord of a mess. Yeah, I mean, like, like I said, I love I love the 80s. I have a very soft spot for it. But they definitely had a different sense of humor and entertainment. And it doesn't like doesn't work anymore. A sense of what was okay. And what was not too far, which is now it's just like optics perspective. Like, anyway, but I, I think that say anything is this fantastic and not problematic. And that that song in your eyes is a very sweet song. And I'm just like, in your eyes by Peter Gabriel. Yep. I love that song. Yep. That is the that is the song. But it's just that that, um, that boombox moment is like, it's very iconic for a reason. Like, it's a very, I don't know, my heart swelled when it happened. I was just like, oh, wait, that's the song that he plays on the box. I didn't know that. Yeah. Sarah Bareilles does a really great cover of it. It's on her like, love songs, drift album. It's incredible. I love I heard that song first through her cover. And then it's a very good song. Okay. It's very good. So and I think I had to like rent it off of Amazon or something. So I don't know where you can watch it. But it I highly recommend it. It's like I said, it's very short. It's only like an hour and a half, I think. And it's just I don't know. It's just good. It's my favorite 80s movie now. Yeah, I'm also kind of a sucker for like, first love stories. This is cute. It's so stupid. You don't know any better. I think that actually is a bit of a segue into what I wanted to bring up with anime and manga romances. Because I love like the sweet, soft, like first love. And I think that's a good thing. I love genre. I was trying to figure out what my favorite romances in anime and manga were. And with manga, I had a lot of different lists of them. With anime, it was a little easier, but I'll go into manga first. I used to read a lot of slice of life. Manga. Oh, yeah. Like, just a ton. And starting with like, okay, I believe in the past, I considered Peach Girl a slice of life. But really, it's a soap opera. I was thinking about that the other day. I was like, what manga did I read? I just read a lot of Peach Girl. For our listeners, I owned every single volume of Peach Girl, which is a very great soap opera manga. It maybe doesn't age super well. There are some things that are like, it's not too bad. Yeah. But I'm thinking particularly of this, the mean girl character who they're kind of friends. But oh, yeah, she's the worst. Yes, he like sets up a lot of things. She is mentally unstable. She sets up like non-con. I'm just gonna say like rape attempts for the main character that don't happen. But it's like, she set them up like she sent a gigolo to her. Anyway, it's like a whole thing. And it's like, or gigolo. I think that was the first time I read that word gigolo. Yeah, in that manga. Anyway, gigolo. Yeah, thinking about it more. I'm just like, this doesn't age super well. But the art is, pretty. And I like the main character a lot. Momo, she's good. Anyway, I read I had all the books and I read the change of heart, like, spin off first. And then I went back and read the first volume. And then I have Peach Girl say story. Anyway, I owned all of them. And then when I was cleaning out my room for my move, I had all these books. And I didn't want to sell these ones with Peach Girl meant a lot to me when I was younger and reading all of it. So I gave them all the peony and now they have a good home. Yeah, they're right next to me. I'm so glad. I have a like a random skinny bookcase. Perfect. And they they've just taken up like three fourths of it. It's very good. They're Tokyo Pop, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So those are like super rare. Just I'm very happy they have a place and they're not just like, you know, dumpster fire. Oh, no, no, they are mine. Online. And you can borrow them whenever you want. The best home thing. We can just co share them. Yes, I love I love Peach Girl a lot. But, that being said, it's not really a romance. It because it's like, oh, it it's a love triangle, but it's not like a romance, really. It's just Yeah, it's just a soap opera drama. But my favorite romance of manga were more of like the actual slice of life things. So first, like first that come to mind was Honey and Clover, which doesn't focus so much on the romance of it. I it's also an anime, it has two scenes of anime, and then it has a live action movie. And the live action movie is really good. It cuts off, like it ends kind of in the middle of the manga series. But if you read the whole series all the way through, I think it has a really satisfying ending that also kind of mentions like, it finally answers the question of why is it called Honey and Clover that's revealed in literally the last or second to last chapter.",
