    "text": " And I kind of keep an eye on the whole space as a researcher and also doing my own work in the area. And the BIP-148 situation caught my eye recently, and I noticed that it started gaining a lot of momentum. So I decided to have a closer look at it and check it out and see what the whole fuss was about. And when I looked a little bit closer at it, I realized that the whole situation seems a little bit... Well, basically, I want to make it clear first that I'm totally in favor of Segwit being adopted on Bitcoin, on the blockchain. The concerns that I have with BIP-148 are of a purely technical nature. And... I think one thing that seems to be missing from all of the coverage and the dialogue about BIP-148 is, well, where is Bitcoin Core on this? So, for example, why is it the case that when people advocate running BIP-148, they send you to UASF.co to download software that's not published by Core? So... So... You know, I honestly don't really know the answer to that, but I do know that not all of Core is behind it. And for that reason, there is no BIP-148 being produced by Core. So that's something that people... That's a very important point, because the entire way that Bitcoin works is you've got multiple consensus processes going around. Not just the minor consensus that's being done, but you also have the whole developer side of, well, what do we do when we change the actual protocol? How do we change the protocol of Bitcoin? How do we improve Bitcoin? And it's a very important process that needs to take place on the Bitcoin developer mailing list. So there's this concept called rough consensus, and it has a very concrete definition, and it's used on the Bitcoin Core mailing list. The basic idea is, you know, we have proposals that people make, and we discuss them and talk about them. And if anyone has any objection to it, they can make their objection. And if that objection is addressed sort of by the wider community on purely technical grounds, then it's considered a sort of done matter. And then you can raise other objections. And until there are basically no objections remaining that are of a legitimate nature, you can't just, you know, repeat the same objection over and over. If it's, you know, clearly been technically addressed, then it's considered a done matter. And there are no objections remaining. You've reached rough consensus. And now you can proceed and go according to whatever that plan was. As long as, you know, no other new objections are raised, release a new software update for everyone, you know, et cetera. That's a very important process that needs to be respected because, you know, for example, with BIP-148, this is a \u2013 I really like the idea, and I totally get the spirit of like, hey, the miners are screwing us over. Well, let's just \u2013 you know, the users have the real power. The users have the real control. Let's, you know, take that power and let's sort of go forward and activate. Well, go right to your SEGWIT. It's a very endearing \u2013 it's very \u2013 it's not just endearing, but it's a, you know, the frustration that's being created by the miners not activating SEGWIT and holding the blockchain kind of, the Bitcoin blockchain hostage, in a sense from improving itself. All of that frustration can kind of be taken out in the form of this user-assisted soft fork. But the point of rough consensus is to make sure that when you make a change, that you know, the\u306drgy, the security of security, Make a change to Bitcoin. You don't do something dumb. You have to give plenty of time when dealing with the $30 billion blockchain for lots of different eyeballs to have a look at the problem and make sure that you don't end up doing something stupid that ends up ruining the entire network or severely harming the value of it. Something unexpected might be found that's like a first order, a second order, a third order consequence of some of the changes being proposed. And BIP-148 has actually a very obvious flaw. It's very obvious actually thanks in large part to Ethereum. So I would say that right now the Bitcoiners out there really should be thanking Ethereum for going out there and experimenting and making mistakes because those are mistakes that Ethereum made and Ethereum has learned from and mistakes that Bitcoin now doesn't have to make. And I'm specific. I'm specifically referring to the replay attack. That's the biggest problem with BIP-148 in my view is the replay attack. I've been talking for a little while now, so I'm going to take a little break and give John, if you have anything to say, let me know or I can continue. Thanks, Greg. I'm just taking notes here. It sounds like you've gotten to the heart of the issue, so I will let you proceed. I don't have any commentary. I'm just going to take a moment. Okay. Okay. So the replay attack is a concern that's not just mine. It's a concern of a whole bunch of people. So we have the exchanges who are concerned about this. We have the core developers who are concerned about this. And we have spectators and commentators who are also concerned about this. Jimmy Song, I think today, just published a very long blog post, which talks... titled UASF BIP-148 Scenarios in Game Theory. And I'm so glad that he finally published a post that acknowledges the replay attack. I think it kind of still doesn't really go into it significantly enough. It's the number one problem with BIP-148. So what is the replay attack? To a lot of Bitcoiners, this term might be new. And the replay attack is a bit of a new term. And the reason is, is because Bitcoin hasn't had to deal with it. But Ethereum had to deal with it. And it really, really wreaked havoc on the entire Ethereum ecosystem, as well as the exchanges. The basic idea is that... And we're now rolling back the clock, going back in time to the DAO situation and the... You know, that's when... Somebody's going to be in a situation where... Somebody made a smart contract that had a flaw in it that was discovered too late. And then $150 million started getting stolen. And people were starting freaking out. And then the Ethereum leaders were forced to basically compromise their whole code is law shtick. And that resulted in Ethereum, the hard forking from the legacy chain. And the legacy chain was renamed to Ethereum Classic. So that was a very different situation. Then what we're talking about with the user-assisted soft fork. One of the biggest differences between those two situations is, you know, one is a soft fork and the other is a hard fork. And what's the difference? Well, the difference is that a hard fork is a complete deviation. It's a completely new protocol. And what happens on a hard fork is follows a completely different set of rules than... Or let's just say incompatible rules than when you do a soft fork. When you have a soft fork... You have a whole bunch of legacy clients that, should they not upgrade, are going to be okay. They'll still be able to participate in some of the consensus. Basically the consensus rules become more narrow. The clients that upgrade to the soft fork will start rejecting transactions and even blocks that do not fit the more narrow set of rules. But because these are narrower set of rules and they still have all the old previous rules, the legacy clients who are more liberal in a sense... I'm sorry. They're more liberal in a sense, will still be able to participate in the network. In a hard fork, that's not what happens. In a hard fork, you have blocks being generated that are valid on one chain and completely invalid to the previous set of nodes. So that's one very important significant difference. And these lead to two different kinds of... One second. Okay. So these lead to two different kinds of scenarios completely and two different kinds of attacks. One is called the wipeout attack and the other is called a replay attack. We're going to stick with replay. So even in a hard fork situation, you can have the replay attack. This is what happened. The Ethereum community was very rushed. They had a deadline approaching basically when the attacker could withdraw the Ethereum that he had stolen effectively. Some argue it wasn't the right time. Some argue it wasn't theft. He was following the code as law thing. You know, that's up for a philosophical debate. Anywho, after a certain amount of time, the attacker would be able to take his Ether and convert it to whatever he wants, Bitcoin, et cetera. So they were under a lot of time pressure and so they made some mistakes. One of the mistakes that they made was they released a hard fork that did not have replay protection. And what this means is that... Sorry, one second. I'm getting notifications and I'm quitting the app that's banging in my ear. Okay. So one of the mistakes that... Yeah, was the replay attack. And so what happened was that people assumed that they would be able to have two different coins on two different blockchains and that they would be able to sell one coin and buy the other and do different sets of transactions on the two chains. Somebody pointed out this thing called the replay attack after they... Or like as they were getting ready to release the software and by that point in time, it was too late to like fix it. Okay. So they just had to release it. So they released it. And they posted as well, a blog post on how to mitigate against the replay attack. But in all of the confusion, many exchanges did not follow that advice. And Coinbase in particular got really screwed by this. There was the situation where people were able to get free Ether Classic in a sense because Coinbase was selling Ether. And they were not splitting that Ether from Ether Classic in a sense. And they were selling the Ether for the price of Ether and not for the price of Ether Plus Ether Classic. So what does it mean to split a token? What it means is... And what is the replay attack? So a replay attack is when you have two separate chains going on and somebody on the network, it doesn't matter who, like anyone can do this. This is important as well to understand that. There's no permission required to do a replay attack. There's nothing... There's nothing difficult about it. You just listen to transactions being broadcast for one chain. And you broadcast them to the other chain. Just rebroadcast them. And that's called a replay attack. And the DAO attacker was doing this throughout the entire thing. All of the transactions that were meant for the Ethereum Classic chain were getting rebroadcast on the Ethereum chain. So in a sense there were not two different chains. They were mostly doing the same thing. Two chains being mirrored. Okay. Okay. split coins, you have to do something to those coins that makes them valid on one blockchain, but invalid on another blockchain. And there are different techniques and different methods that you can use to do this. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad in that they're not very easy to do, or they're very complicated, or they're unlikely. They only work sometimes, you know, et cetera. In the case of Ethereum, because Ethereum had smart contracts, they were able to come up, the community came up with splitting contracts. These are contracts that you send your Ether to, and on one chain, you can get that Ether back, and on another chain, you can't. So that's how they were able to split Ether and Ethereum clashing. And then the exchanges started picking this up and doing this for people as well, and people could do it by themselves. So fast-forwarding the clock now to today, and the BIP-148 situation, the user-assisted soft fork, people are being told that they have this power to, I think one of the terms thrown around is this asymmetric game theory situation where the miners are kind of worried about the wipeout attack, which is basically because we're dealing with a soft fork now and not a hard fork, which means that the people who are running the user-assisted soft fork nodes, the BIP-148 nodes, they are going to refuse to rebroadcast blocks that don't fit the new set of more restrictive rules, and they're going to start creating their own chain. So this effectively can create a new chain, and the wipeout attack is when, for a moment, let's say you've got a smaller chain, the BIP-148 chain has some miners making blocks, but remember, this is another point that people keep forgetting, is that you can't, it's not entirely user-assisted, you can't do a 100% user-assisted soft fork because you need blocks, and users and nodes don't make blocks, miners make blocks, so you need some of the miners on your side to make these blocks. For real quick, I want to clarify that the acronym UASF stands for user activated soft fork. So the idea is that rather than relying on minor signaling and the percent of the last thousand blocks or something like that to activate the soft fork. Instead, users clients will just on a specific, after a specific block start enforcing the new rules. So that's why they call it a user activated soft fork because it's the user's client that's activating the soft fork and not miners by mining a particular number of blocks with a certain signal or something like that. So just- I would not say that it's 100% correct because it's user activated in the sense that they're saying that their full nodes are going to reject any blocks that are not signaling segwit. That's all it means. So they need somebody to be generating those blocks that are signaling segwit. And they aren't making those blocks, the miners are making those blocks. So they need some fraction of those miners on their side. They don't have those miners, they're just going to be sitting there without any blocks and that chain isn't going to be doing anything and it's going to be completely worthless. So, and not only isn't going to be completely worthless, but it's going to get more and more worthless as time goes on. Because people are still sending transactions to the network and those transactions have to get into blocks and they're getting into the legacy blocks. But the longer they're not getting into your 148 chain, the bigger backlog you have, the higher the transaction fees there are, the more of a mess it is. So, you know, etc.",
