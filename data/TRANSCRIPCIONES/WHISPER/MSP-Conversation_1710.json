    "text": " Well, there was Sapp's General Store, and they were very nasty people. They were the boys that used to sled on our property and beat up on my brother. I don't know if it had anything to do with religion. Then there was Pikesville Skull, which was just south of the old soldier's home. I don't think it went through high school, but it certainly had no college preparatory program. One of the reasons we went to Park was that if you expected your kids to get college preparatory class education, you had to send them to the city. There was no county school. At all, there was of any quality. You weren't expected to prepare anybody to go beyond high school if that far. You had to pay tuition in order to go to the city schools. My mother, I don't want to switch around too much, but my mother went to Western High School and to School 49, which was for her. She. She had a little covey of Jewish friends who were best friends all their lives, most of whom became professionals. There were five or six women. Dr. Lucille Levers and Dr. Bessie Moses and Hilda Blastine, who came into the story later. There was this little group of six, seven women who were like sisters and stayed friends all their lives. My mother was the first one who died of the group. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And she returned to the school and took brools. And she became an educator. And what I remember most about that was that it wasn't a military claim and everything was about boys. You know, there wereuku\u4efbsted if l who were originals at Hopkins Medical School before Dr. Finkelstein, in fact, by some years, were quite unusual women and very, very close to one another. They were just like sisters all their lives. Thugs do what they do, I guess. They want to be with us. What did Park School mean in comparison to the public schools? Did you feel like that people treated you differently because you went to Park School? When you say people, which people? I mean, the other Jewish kids? Or other kids in the neighborhood? Well, Baltimore, of course, has a big... Okay. Park, I had 17 in my class, and that was it. The largest one, I think, maybe had 25. And the whole school was around 300 when I graduated. It's now built up to, I think it's close to 1,000. I know it's tripled in size. And, of course, it's on a different campus. It has a lot of amenities. We didn't... As far as being a... I mean, I had a lot of friends that went to Garrison Junior High and Forest Park Senior High. It's funny, I'm very vague about where they went to school before they started in the last half of secondary education. And we can sort of... I guess we really thought we were a lot better off than they were. I don't know. I don't know how they looked at us. And there were also some not-too-bright kids whose parents made great sacrifices to send them there. Because this is all the oppression years. I graduated in 45. And up until the pre-war period, people weren't that prosperous. I was a doctor's daughter. My father was a physician. And the kids, most of the children were business people. And some of them very wealthy, like the Blasteins and Rosenbergs. And they all had businesses. Lee Bow. In fact, I have this memory of Sammy Leibowitz. His family were handlers. They made handlers ice cream. And you had to consume the things your classmates... In fact, I think Amoco gasoline was blue-colored. And in those days, the automobile... The automobile gas gauge had a... You could tell what kind of gas the person was burning in the car by the color of the glass in the glass gauge. And you dared have pink, which was standard oils. You had to have Amoco blue. It wasn't right otherwise. And... Well, Sammy Leibowitz's family owned handlers. And I can remember walking around the street. Walking to Pikesville, which we could do pretty close to where we lived, with my brother and Sammy. He was visiting in Winter Park. And they sold better gold ice cream. And Sammy wanted a Dixie cup. I guess we were about seven, eight years old. He wanted a Dixie cup. And we cajoled him into buying an ice cream cup, because you could tell the brand if you bought a Dixie cup. And we were walking back. I can still imagine the same... I can still remember it. We had told Sammy he had just consumed most of a better gold ice cream cone instead of his family. And he threw it down on the ground. We were on a dirt road, and he threw it down. He rolled and screamed. As though he'd just been told it was strychnine. But there was a lot of that. And of course there were hot slurs and hamburgers made only men's clothes at that time. So the kids didn't wear them. But the store labels were all somebody's parents and doctor's children, as we were. We were looked upon like preachers and teachers. They didn't have the money. And in fact, we wouldn't have gone there if our grandparents hadn't been pretty well-to-do. Because he couldn't afford the tuition off his physician's income. Things have changed now. I think it's about half physicians. What kind of practice did your father have? He was a neuropsychiatrist. Quite a pioneer in his field. He didn't have much of that then. He wasn't a Freudian. He believed in the physical origins of mental illness. He also treated, say, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's. That's quite a long story. That's a type of neurological disease. It was a combination. In fact, I think the mental part they used to call alienists in those days. I haven't heard the word used in many years. He was a psychiatrist in the early vintage. I've never heard the word neuropsychiatrist. Well, you wouldn't because now the two fields are pretty well separated. I don't know. But he was pretty well recognized in his field. He taught and practiced. I'm going to move us back just a little time. Was your mother and your father, how were they matched? I would assume that your mother's family would have wanted, that it was very important that she marry appropriately and well. Well, of course, I suppose that's true of all families. But one thing I think that dominated both sides is that my mother and father were more approved by both sides than the other siblings' marriages of aunts and uncles. Everybody thought they were a wonderful combination. They were. But they were quite well integrated from a family. They were integrated from a background point of view. And of course, they were both Jewish. There was very little intermarriage then. I think now it's grown up to 50%. Of course, I engaged in it. But then it was very, very rare. And it didn't happen. Though I had one of my father's sisters married a non-Jew. They adopted Judaism. They didn't bring up anybody as a Christian or anything like that. Now, did you say you married out of their religion? Yes, I did. Tell me about that. Well, we're skipping a few years. Yeah, well, I thought we were there. Okay. Well, my husband came from sort of a next thing to the Mayflower. But he wasn't typical. His family were bankers. They were manufacturers, that sort of thing. But he wasn't. He was an organizer for the United... Well, he was the regional director for the United Auto Workers. Very liberal and very involved in early civil rights and things like that, activities. But his family was not. In fact, his mother was an isolated old lady. I think I'm the only Jew she ever met. And she was towering of it, but quite skeptical. She used to send me Hanukkah cards and things like that because she figured I never sent them to anybody else. But we got along all right. We didn't see a whole lot of each other. But she had... I don't know. Of course, my grandchildren I called. My grandchildren I call them that, but they're not natural children who are the children of his son who died very young. They're Christians. And I think in some respects they think I'm different. I've never been a very good Jew in terms of observance. But I guess today, more of my friends aren't Jewish than are. I don't... Both because of my husband's associations and the ones I developed. I don't feel today as though I'm a part of the Jewish community. I mean, I'm Jewish, but I just don't, as a Jew, integrate very much with the community. And such as I do. I don't think I have Jewish friends that are better Jews than I am. In fact, all my Jewish friends are better Jews than I am. How old were you when you married? Well, I lived with Bert for 11 years, which was something else. It's no longer very unusual, but for various reasons we couldn't get married. He had been previously married. And that was pretty tough. Both because of the Jewish community. Both from my family's viewpoint. They didn't like it, needless to say. And, of course, likes drift to likes. And we knew a number of others in the same category. But we met in 52. And we didn't marry until 65. I'd known them quite a while by then. And I don't... I guess we held the record among people. At least among the Jewish friends. What was the reaction within your family? Oh, they were very unhappy about it. And I could see their viewpoint. I mean, my grandmother, my mother's mother, died. My father's mother, who at that point lived in Baltimore. He looks like he drinks too much. All kinds of unhappiness. And I guess some of my friends were estranged for that reason. But I never really cared that much because if they were going to be like that, I wasn't that... interested in having them for friends. Elizabeth, tell me, you know, growing up Jewish in a Jewish... in Jewish communities, or even in a tight Jewish family, how and when did you actually start to meet people who were not Jewish? I guess not until I went to college. I mean, I knew some. But not until I went to college did I really consort with a lot of people. Well, my family did to some extent. My father had a lot of colleagues that weren't Jewish. But it was... They weren't over at the house much. Or there wasn't a whole lot of intercourse of a social nature. But there was never... Neither of my parents ever built this for me. But I knew some. And I knew from the first wall that you see so much among most Jews, I guess. I mean, I think my family was a little more open to everything than most of the others I observed. And so it was never them and us. And never the line gets crossed with my family. I didn't feel at all intimidated or discriminated. I never really felt any discrimination. I knew it was there, but it didn't really matter. It didn't count. I mean, no incidents. I don't remember... I mean, I was aware there were certain hotels and certain places that didn't take Jews. But then it didn't seem to be that painful. So what did you do? Well, we used to like to go out and have dinner. We'd go out for dinner. And then we'd go to lunch together. And then we'd go to the next one. We'd go to a restaurant together.",
