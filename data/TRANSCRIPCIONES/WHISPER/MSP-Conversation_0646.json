    "text": " I'm Bonnie Faulkner. Today we're featuring Michael C. Rupert, publisher and editor of From the Wilderness Publications on The Truth and Lies of 9-11. The following is from a presentation Rupert gave on February 21st in San Francisco. This is the seventh lecture that I have given in the 9-11 series. I want to leave you tonight with the message that your lives and your liberty are on the line now. There is no more opportunity for armchair discussion. There is no more time. The philosophy with which I started publishing From the Wilderness four years ago was very simple. I don't publish anything that I can't document. I don't ask you to take anything that I write on faith. I will offer opinions and I'll tell you their opinions. I'll give you my analysis. But I don't make any assertions unless I tell you where I got the information so that you can go find it for yourself. And I have taken on some very big issues. I've been in the business of big names in four years. I won't go through the litany. I have never been sued because truth is an absolute defense against libel. Absolutely. All the time. What I'm doing tonight is I'm presenting to you exactly the same way that I would present if I were a detective talking to a district attorney or if I were an attorney talking to a grand jury. I'm presenting a case with the evidence. I will not speculate. There's a lot of things we're not going to talk about tonight which can't be covered. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to where there are explosives in the building, where the airplane's flown by remote control, all these cul-de-sacs that you can't go into that I can't produce proof for. I don't care. They're irrelevant. My job is to reach the people out there who haven't been reached with those facts that shake the foundation of their belief that they're the fundamentally most blessed people on the planet enjoying a standard of living because God loves Americans above all other peoples in the world. Which is what George Bush sells. I have to shake their belief in the system. You don't do that with speculation. Now there's some things that I have to tell you before we start talking about September the 11th. If you don't understand these things you will never understand completely why September the 11th happened. One is drugs and the other is oil. If you're in the U.S. government in the executive branch and somebody working under you commits a crime there is a law in title 18 U.S. code that says, You have to turn in your employees if they're committing crimes. You have to call the Justice Department. You have to call the FBI and report the criminal activity. Well they knew that. It's a law. So they had a negotiation. In this negotiation, which was between William French Smith, which you can barely read down here, that's Reagan's first attorney general, but you can read, boy there's an oxymoron, the Honorable William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence. In view of the fine cooperation, the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from the U.S. Department of Justice from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures. Let me let that sink in for a minute. The Attorney General has just notified the head of the CIA that he no longer has to tell the Department of Justice when his people are dealing drugs. There it is in black and white. Proof of a conspiracy. Right there. By the way, do you know who negotiated this memorandum for William French Smith? Ken? Ken Stark. Now there's one reason and one reason only why the CIA deals drugs. Not to fund covert operations, not to make George Bush rich, but to support the U.S. economy. June 27th, 1999, New York Stock Exchange chief meets Colombian top rebel commander, Bogota. A guy by the name of Dick Grasso flies to Bogota and meets with the FARC guerrillas. Now everybody knows in Colombia, right, everybody deals drugs, right? Everybody. Left, right, center, government, paramilitaries, they all deal drugs. And what Dick Grasso said when he was meeting with the FARC commander was, will you please invest your drug money in Wall Street? That's what he said. It's in the story right there. He didn't say drug money, but he said let us manage your funds and it's, you know, everybody knows the only way that FARC makes money is by taxing the cocaine trade. Black and white. Didn't hear that on Peter Jennings, did you? Okay, so he's asking for money to Wall Street. And you know what the FARC guys told him? They said, no, senor, a year later, President Bill Clinton announces Plan Colombia. You know, and we since displaced two million people from their homes by spraying glyphosate from Monsanto. And we're spraying food crops, of course, and we're just driving the cocaine production onto lands controlled by the paramilitaries. And we're getting ready to go to war in Colombia again because there's oil there. But let's stay on the drug theme for a minute. In January of last year, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, author of a minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Correspondent Banking. And this is a copy of, this is the first page of the report. I just wanted to show you what the report looks like. If you go down at the bottom, it says, inattention by and disinterest by U.S. banks in screening the foreign banks they take in as clients have allowed rogue foreign banks and their criminal clients to carry on money laundering and other criminal activity in the United States. And yes, that's true, and to protect the narcotics industry. And then if you read the report a little bit further, it says J.P. Morgan, who was, by the way, the largest creditor of Enron, Bank of America, Citigroup, and First Union are laundering all this drug money. It says down here, one trillion trillion laundered annually. That's from the U.S. Senate. And it says 500 billion. And it says 500 billion through the United States banking system. The rest of it's going through Wall Street. The current regime, the current empire, and we are an empire now, get that straight, has crossed a line of criminality from which it cannot turn back. It has no alternative now but to proceed apace until it imposes a full dictatorship, a full fascist state, because the level of criminality is so out of the closet they just don't care anymore. They just don't care anymore. But I saw this back in May when Citibank, Citigroup, by the way, who's on the board of directors at Citigroup? John Deutch, the former CIA director. Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs, former secretary of the treasury. A woman named Nora Slatkin, the former CIA executive director. That's the number three position. They paid $12 billion to buy Banco Nacional de Mexico, Banamex, second largest bank in Mexico. It is an absolute disaster. It is an overt open drug money laundering bank in Mexico. So overt that a brilliant Mexican newspaper named Porresto wrote a story about two years ago about the bank's owner, Roberto Hernandez. He owns most of the Yucatan Peninsula. In fact, the natives refer to it as the cocaine peninsula. There's landing strips all over the place. There's refueling for boats. And they published all this documenting that Hernandez was a major drug trafficker. By the way, in August of 2000, Bill Clinton vacationed for ten days on Hernandez's property. President-elect Vicente Fox, the first day after winning the election, paid a courtesy call on Roberto Hernandez. Roberto Hernandez shared a media consultant with George W. Bush. Hernandez now sits on the floor of the Yucatan Peninsula. He's on the board of directors with Robert Rubin, John Deutch at Citigroup. They don't care if you know how criminal they are anymore. They are laughing at you. And they hold the rest of the American people in utter contempt. Let's take a little look at CIA and Wall Street. The National Security Act of 1947 was written by Clark Clifford, an aide to Harry Truman. Long time Democratic Party powerhouse. He wrote the act that created the CIA. Who can tell me what his profession was? Wall Street lawyer and banker. As a matter of fact, Clark Clifford is the American who brought the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI, onto American shores. Okay, BCCI was a huge drug money laundering bank. Now, the CIA was designed for Clifford by two brothers, John Foster and Allen Dulles. John Foster was Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower. Allen Dulles was DCI, get used to the term, Director of Central Intelligence, DCI, from 53 to 61. John Kennedy fired him after the Bay of Pigs. What was their profession? Wall Street lawyers from the firm Sullivan and Cromwell, the most powerful law firm, wouldn't we agree on that, on Wall Street. By the way, who are Enron's attorneys? Sullivan and Cromwell. Okay, Bill Casey. All right, most of us are old enough to remember Iran-Contra. What was Bill Casey's job for Richard Nixon? He was Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stanley Sporkin, retired recently as a U.S. District Court Judge in Washington, D.C., CIA General Counsel in the 1980s. What was his job before he was the CIA General Counsel? He was General Counsel of the SEC. David Daugherty, who was the CIA General Counsel after Stanley Sporkin. Anybody know what he does now? Gotta love this one.
