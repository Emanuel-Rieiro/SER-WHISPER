    "text": " The Labour's manifesto has got a lot of attention recently as it shows all the costings which a lot of them don't. The highlights of Jeremy Corbyn's manifesto for Labour is income tax to the top 5% of earners. Those are more than \u00a380,000 a year to face 45p marginal rate of income tax and a new 50% rate on earnings above \u00a3123,000 to raise \u00a36.4 billion a year. They pledge not to increase VAT or increase national insurance contributions. Scotland have to set their own tax rate. Company taxes. Labour plans to raise \u00a348.6 billion to pay for extra spending. Plans to raise an extra \u00a319.4 billion a year from co-operation tax by raising the headline rate from 21% to 26%. They're trying to nationalise things like the water industry. Saved water bills have risen 40% since privatisation. Labour's manifesto promises to replace... ...a dysfunctional water system with a network of regional publicly owned water companies. Party claims this could reduce household bills by \u00a3100 a year. Free childcare and early years support. Labour says it will introduce a \u00a35.3 billion package including extending 33 hours of childcare to all two-year-olds... ...and moving towards making some childcare available for one-year-olds and extending paternity pay to 12 months. Ending the freeze on welfare benefits, pensions. Labour set out pensions as proposed to freeze a State pension age to 66. This commitment means that the planned rise from 66 to 67 during June between 2026 and 2028 will not happen. There was a leaked draft last week with some late amendments. Public sector recruitment being one of them. An earlier pledge to recruit an extra 1,000 boarder guards has been halved to 500. And a new ookrad pledge to recruit 3,000 firefighters. The export of pilot air for illegal aircraft will be ended in 10 days after complete.' The extra cost of 10,000 police officers is a budget of 300 million. That's kind of it, really. All of them have a lot of policies in there and a lot of mind-bending figures. It can get quite overwhelming if you read them all at once, which I've just done. The problem with the Labour's manifesto is everyone's saying, how are they going to afford it? But in one of the pages of the manifesto, they've done a cost breakdown and it all adds up. And they've added in some extra money for contingency, so if anything doesn't work out or they don't raise as much money as they need to, they've got some money to kind of fall back on, I guess. The ITV leaders' debate was last night and there were five MPs of seven. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn didn't turn up, both of which sparked anger from the general public. And as I said in the last episode, it shows that they're not willing to hear other people's standpoints on their policies and what they propose to bring in and things like that. So the people that were there were Caroline Lucas, Nicholas Sturgeon, Paul Nuttall, Leanne Wood and Tim Farron. And they all discussed a variety of topics such as Brexit, energy bills, schools, everything. So yeah, if you want to go and watch that, it's on the ITV Hub. It's a really good debate, you should go and watch it. But I think the reason they didn't go was because they wanted a separate debate between those two, which isn't really fair because you've already been invited to a debate, so you might as well show up and debate it with all of the other parties. I really don't see why not. They all wanted, they all had the opportunity to kind of express themselves and their policies and Theresa May got slammed because she wasn't there. So they just, it was an open goal to criticise her and her policies and they did that. And they said, you know, if you're watching, this is what we're going to improve on from your government, try to persuade voters to vote for them. So very interesting. So we shall see what comes of it on June the 8th. Thank you for your time. Thank you for all of you. Thank you. And who is now? Hi Tom. Hello. Hi. So you're obviously Digital Secretary for All the Conservatives, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so what does that job involve exactly? Well, that's mainly with running the social media aspect of things, with like the Twitter and the Facebook and making sure pictures of candidates meeting constituents get out there to people online. So it's mainly things like that. And promoting what we've been doing locally and also what sort of things we're doing nationally as well. Yeah, so kind of on the subject of kind of the national sort of agenda, it's kind of how do you think like Theresa May's like handling things like Brexit? How did you vote and how do you think she's handled the situation so far, especially as going in kind of as a Remainer? Okay. So I think Theresa May is absolutely the best poised person to negotiate. I think she's the best poised person to negotiate the Brexit deal because with all due respect, with the Liberal Democrats and to you, Kip, they are pretty much irrelevant in this election. There is a very straight choice between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. And I think even when lifelong Labour voters are looking at that choice, I think Theresa May wins hand down because they look at her and they think, yes, that is the Prime Minister. That is a leader. They look at Jeremy Corbyn and they see a man who can't even control his own party. So how the hell can he control a country if someone's been as important as Brexit? What do you think Theresa's got that the others haven't? I think Theresa May comes across, well, like I've said, I think she comes across very well as a leader. She's very strong. She's very firm. She knows exactly what she wants. She has a very clear set of principles. And I think that she's got a very strong team backing her. Yeah. So, like, do you think the kind of, especially the recent rise in Labour, do you think that's going to hinder the result at all? Well, I think that's going to hinder the result at all. Well, I think that's going to hinder the result at all. I think we have to remember that political party membership is not always reflective of what the electorate does. I mean, the Conservative Party membership is probably under 200,000, yet we won 11 million votes in 2015. So I think it's more important to be looking at ordinary voters who may be not as vocal on politics, but who still take an interest in their own personal finances and the finances of the country and what's going on, rather than, well, to be quite frank, political obsessive, like me. Yeah. At the end of the day, they are the most important people. And I think Theresa May has done an incredible job at saying to Labour voters, who obviously will not naturally like Conservative policies, saying, I understand that you're not sympathetic to us usually, but I ask you, while your party is in this dreadful state, lend us your vote so we can get Brexit done properly. So what do you think of, kind of, Tim Farron and people like the Dems who are trying to reverse Brexit? Because it's not going to happen. No, it's not going to happen. And I think it's about time that people like Nicola Sturgeon and Tim Farron realise that. And that's what I'm saying to Remain voters on the doorstep. Whether you voted for Brexit or not, it is happening. So at the end of the day, the choice you have now is who do you want to be negotiating it? Yeah. So I think Tim Farron has done his party and his country a great disservice by pushing against what the people of this country voted for. Because I think it's also important to remember that about a third of Liberal Democrat members actually supported the leak votes. So not only is he alienating huge swathes of the country, he's alienating quite a big chunk of his own party. So do you think leakage of all the German, like, all this Brexit stuff from... John Ford Juncker, yeah. Yeah, that's him. Do you think it's kind of propaganda to get the Conservatives kind of out? Or do you think to show that Theresa May doesn't really have any say or any strength or anything like that? Well, I think it was always obvious from the start that John Ford Juncker wasn't very happy about making this easy for us. And I think we've seen that this week with the things that have been leaked. But at the end of the day, Theresa May is not someone who is going to let herself be walked all over. And if John Ford Juncker thinks he's going to get an easy ride with her, he's not going to know what's sitting when those negotiations have started. Because she is a very strong, very independent-minded woman who is not going to allow some man from Europe to tell her where she's going. Okay. So did you vote remain or leave? I wasn't actually old enough to vote and I didn't actually take a side because I personally found I was compelled by neither side. And I think, unlike a general election, there wasn't a balance of pros and cons. I feel like... I think there was an equal amount of good points and bad points on both sides. So if I had been voting, I would probably have made the decision when I was in the ballot station. Yeah, I think that's what a lot of people did. Definitely. From what I've been talking to from ordinary voters, that's definitely what a lot of people did. Yeah, so what have the ordinary voters been telling you about voting Conservative and what they want from this election? Um... Well, I think one of the things that has been coming up on the doorstep more than anything is definitely Jeremy Corbyn. And any Labour politician who tells you in a marginal seat that Jeremy Corbyn only comes up some of the time is lying through their teeth. I'm in Aldermeaston, Savileworth, which has a 6,000 Labour majority. And more or less every door you knock on, he is raised. Yeah. Mostly negatively. And I have had lifelong Labour voters amongst friends and family say to me, they're in... absolutely no way I can vote Labour knowingly and put that man in Downing Street. And I think it's very silly for Labour MPs to say, I'm standing in this election but I still don't support Jeremy Corbyn. In my opinion, if you are standing in this election under the banner of the Labour Party, you are endorsing Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister. And I think people like John Woodcock seriously need to consider this. I think he's a very important person. I think he's a very important person. I think he's a very important person. And the President... I want to argue that. I'd like to argue that. I think he's a very important person in our party. Yeah. And I think he's got a very interesting blow in that position. Does he get into parties and go ask random questions that are against him that will only really start again? Well, I suppose with if or until YEAH, I'm not entirely sure. I don't feel like he would actually put him in that position. But I think if at the present time he's kind of collagen and backbone, he could really bring his previous intend to a Integr fulfilled with Anybody on Time. I don't know. And I think that like the other\u0440\u0430\u0448urb, I think he has grown up quite naturally in ways that aren't his... maybe he thought they were starts. But he's not the... No, I think, he is quite a... Yeah. because that potentially is someone who could be in charge of our police force in five or six weeks' time. And the prospect of that puts a fear of absolute god into me. If you had to sum up why to vote Conservative for those who are a bit on the fence about it and you had 45 seconds to a minute, what would you say? I'd say to people who are not naturally Conservative supporters and who might have voted Labour all their lives, this is not an ordinary election. This is an election where we face one of the biggest tasks our country has ever faced. And in the choice between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, I think the choice is incredibly clear. Theresa May has proven to be a strong leader who is willing to stand up to world leaders. Jeremy Corbyn has not got the guts to blast our enemies out of the face of the earth with a nuclear weapon. I'd say to people who are considering voting Liberal Democrat or UKIP, if you're voting UKIP, your job is done. And I'm sure that most of the people who voted for Brexit are very grateful for what you have done to deliver the referendum and to deliver the results. But if you want to get a clean Brexit, a good Brexit, and the Brexit you voted for on the 23rd of June last year, you need to vote Conservative. If I was talking to a Liberal Democrat supporter, I'd say, if someone wins an election, you don't contest that because some people didn't. At the end of the day, the majority of the people... Most people in this country voted to leave the European Union. Some people might not have liked that, and I know Conservatives who did not support that decision. But at the end of the day, we live in a democracy. What the people vote for is what the people must have. So what have people been saying on social media, especially the younger generation who are more inclined to vote Labour? What have I been saying or what have they been saying? What have they been saying? Well, obviously, yes, the younger generation are more likely to vote Labour. I have seen amongst my friends, simply by talking to them about the Conservatives' plan for this country, they are starting to break down the stereotypes in their own mind that they have. I mean, obviously, there's always going to be that stereotype that the Conservatives are the party of the rich. And I think I'm living proof that that's absolute rubbish. I mean, I live in the North. I live in Greater Manchester. I've always been a state educator. I was brought up in a single-parent household. So I'm classed as the rich. God knows what isn't. Yeah. So what do you think are some of the stereotypes that some of your friends have been saying and that you've debunked from them? I think that the thing that annoys me the most, probably the most blatant lie, is that the Conservatives want to privatise the NHS, which I actually find incredibly offensive. If you wanted to privatise the NHS, I mean, we've been in government for longer than any political party in the last century. If we really, really wanted to, we would have done it by now. A party that wants to privatise the NHS does not commit the money that the NHS asked for at the last election. And I think it's very rich of Labour to accuse them of this, because if you look at the control of private enterprises of the NHS, when they were in power, it was about at 6%. The coalition reduced that to 4%. So if anyone is the party of NHS privatisation, it's the Labour Party. I saw you voted on. And I see people online about the recent Theresa May putting money into mental health. Like, what's your opinion on that? Do you think that's a good thing or not? I think it's really excellent, because I've had experiences with mental health myself. And I think one of the things that I was most pleased about about that announcement is that every school should have a mental health expert, which I always argued for when I was a school, because I think a lot of young people, while they're off the pastoral care department, are very good, they're not specifically trained in dealing with young people with mental health problems. I think a lot of people forget that mental health, it's not just an emotion, it is an illness, and it needs to be treated. So I think this injection of new money, along with the 10,000 extra staff, is greatly welcomed. Okay, well I think that's all the questions we've got for you today, Tom. I've enjoyed it a lot, thank you very much for having me on.",
