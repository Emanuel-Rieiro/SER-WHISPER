    "text": " If you get a chance to watch the second episode of Constantine, let me see how you like it. I just it was just weird. Like it just didn't grab me. And I kind of just like like it was on and it just ended up just being background noise for me. Like I really wasn't paying attention. And then I just like I think I got like I'm like, is this like literally I was like, is this episode over yet? Like that's what I was like waiting for. And I was just like, OK, I can't even finish this episode. So I kind of just I was like, all right, I think Constantine is just one of those shows that's just not going to make it through the final cuts and stuff like that. But Walking Dead, did you get to see that with what? Oh, basically the what happened to Beth? Yes, we have that. We watch live. So that's definitely a show we're definitely caught up on that. Last week's episode, I was kind of like, man, I could take it or leave it. But I mean, like the ending with Carol showing up on the stretch, I was like, oh, yeah, no, that was really good. I did like that episode because we finally got to see what happened to Beth. And then it's kind of crazy to see the. We these people, basically, they're in a hospital. There's some cops. There's one doctor, a lot of foul shit going on, basically. But that one woman that's going like, oh, no, we're going to be the ones that rebuild, you know, the world again. And someone's coming for us. And Beth is like, are you out of your fucking mind? No one's coming like like these people are grasped onto the thing that like people are coming to like save these people. I'm like, that's not happening. It's like you're either going to die in this building or you're going to get the fuck out and try to survive. Out there and stuff. But I thought it was really good. It was a really good episode considering what happened after, like the Rick episode with the Terminus people taking them down finally. And then it sucks, though, because right where it ended, you're like, oh, my God, because it looks like Carol comes up. Now, everyone's speculating things with this. I came up with a theory where I think that Daryl and Carol have scouted out the place because Daryl's like, oh, there's the cars. There's this. And I think Carol got herself caught. It's going to go in blazing. And then I have a feeling that Daryl's outside. I do and recon out there to take out anything he needs to do. I did like how the episode almost ended because I'm pretty sure she was going to go kill the doctor guy. And the only reason why she was going to do that is because her father was a veterinarian. So she does have a little bit of medical background. And that could give her basically a lead way of like, well, you fucking people need me now. So I did like this because it was kind of a transition of Beth kind of, you know, becoming realizing like she does not know if her people are alive still. She has no idea if anybody even knows she's here, if anybody's even coming for her. So she realizes like. I mean, if I don't fucking man up, I'm going to die here. And I don't want that. Yeah. So, I mean, we'll see what happens. It should be interesting. Now, the kid that got away. Oh, everybody hates Chris. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Him. I have a feeling he might be the guy that Daryl pulls out of the woods. Maybe. Oh, that would also be a good one, too. Mm hmm. So, I mean, again, we're not going to find out tonight or this past Sunday if you're listening to this on Wednesday or Thursday. I mean, I understand you get a few days late, but it looks like it's me mostly based off of Glenn, Maggie and Abraham. Yeah. Abraham. Thank you. Thank you. It's been bugging me for a while. I don't know if you saw. Do you watch the Talking Dead? Yes. OK. Now they showed a little clip. If you're not caught up with The Walking Dead. I apologize if we spoiled anything for you or whatnot. But then again, we this is Wednesday now. And most likely if you're not caught up because we're like basically when the show records, we're like an episode behind because record on Sunday. So we don't we don't know what's going to happen on tonight's episode of Walking Dead, which we're talking about now. But they did show this little preview for just this. Well, I love it's like, well, here's a little sneak peek of The Walking Dead for next week. And it's just Abraham beating the crap out of a guy with a can of corn. And already I'm just like, this is the funny part. I'm like, Rick and Abraham are pretty much on the same page right now. Where it's just like basically in the zombie apocalypse, there's certain people that you could be. If you run into people, you could be either like, oh, my God, help me. And, you know, I'm not going to fuck over your people and stuff like that. And you actually have to be honest about that. Don't try to be like, I'm going to get in good with these people and try to fuck with them. Because Abraham and Rick right now are at the point where I don't fucking care. If you even look at me funny, I'm going to fucking murder you. Like, that's how that's where they're at right now. Well, let me ask you this. Did the guy. Did the guy that he's beating the crap out of with the can. Did he look familiar? No, it looked like a brand new guy. So honestly, for some reason to me, it looked like Eugene. Eugene, Eugene. Who's you? Oh, the guy who says he can't care. Yeah, but I don't know if he would do that because he he's he's he's basing his entire like his journey. His life goal right now is to keep Eugene safe. Right. So have you read the comics? I'm trying to remember. Like, I think I only read up to like probably like issue 20. Four or something like that. So like I Abraham, I know he's in the comics and he's a brand new character to me. So. All right. Well, here's the thing. All right. Do you mind if I spoil this for you? Do you want to wait? You can go right ahead. All right. Eugene does not know a cure. Oh. Yeah, he does not know the cure. He in the comics. He finally comes out and says, look, I don't know the cure. I just did this just so I could get protection. And believe it or not, they don't actually kill him. They get pissed off at him. They kind of shut him a little bit, but they don't actually kill him. So I'm thinking you think that might be the breaking point with Abraham. Yeah, because, yeah, I would. Abraham finds out is like, fuck you. I wasted my whole time. I wasted good men or whatever. And just to protect your sorry ass. So I'm going to be the crap out of you with this hand. Yeah. And you know what? I don't blame him because if you think about it, he fixes his bus. He had to leave half the group. Yeah. And he had to leave half the group. Yeah. And he had to leave half the group. And he had to leave half the group. Which everybody was all set to go to Washington. And they have like. And that's the thing. They have a really like this group right now, I would say, is like the best one they fucking have. It's like everyone can pretty much handle their own. Everyone knows what the hell they're doing. It's all like everybody knows, like. And even as much as like Abraham and Rick are busting heads, they both want what's best for the group. Like they might not see eye to eye, but they both know that it's like it's the well-being of this group. And even they were both kind of like it's like they really both did not want to have to split up. And they were like, we have a good fucking group right here. You know, it's like, look what the fucking look what they did with fucking Terminus for crying out loud. Like they're like a small fucking army to be reckoned with. And like basically you are splitting up two heavy hitters right there. You got Abraham with military background and shit like that. And then you got Rick, who's basically been pulling the entire group together for, you know, five seasons now. Yeah. So, yeah. And the thing is, Rick. Sorry to interrupt, but I was just going to say Rick's got the upper hand because he's got Michonne and Daryl. Yes. Two of the biggest heavy hitters in the group. Yeah. Yeah. No, definitely. So, yeah, it's going to be very interesting this season. And as much as I know, a lot of people are kind of pissed off right now. Like not that it's a bad season, but the fact that what they're doing, how they kind of split things. Basically, there's three like storylines going on right now. And honestly, I kind of enjoy that. Because I feel if you don't because I mean, a prime example, season two, the farm. I mean, that took forever. Granted, yes, it was during the writer's strike and stuff like that. But there was just way too much just like nothing happens. Like, oh, my God, one zombie. Oh, my God, one zombie. Oh, my God. No zombies. Oh, my God. I hate you. Oh, my God. I'm Shane. I slept with your wife. Oh, my God. Like, just it was really like a fucking soap opera season two. I mean, they should have done was midseason finale reveal that. What the hell was her name was there. And then just move on. You're not looking for her anymore. She's dead. Move the fuck on. But they decided to wait till the entire end of the season. Actually, they wait for the midseason finale. To finally show where she was. Carol's. Oh, yeah. I'm just saying, like, they stay on the entire farm for the whole season when they could have probably just left like right afterwards. I mean, because technically, like, I mean, in the comic book, I don't think the farm like is like you meet her show and you meet a few other people. But it's really not like a huge. Plot point. I mean, it was there for a little bit. But I mean, no one like me. I eventually did. Actually, the farm never even got overrun by zombies. They were there for a little bit. And then they went to the prison. And some of the people like Glenn actually stayed on the farm. Yeah. With Herschel and them. And then eventually they decided to finally leave and come join them. So, yeah, it's like. But I totally understand. And this is the first like they even said, like, I'm talking to some of that like this season. They're really weaving it into like it's going to go down the path of what's going on in the comic at that point. And, you know, a little bit of new stuff, you know, for people who are big fans of comics. So they are weaving a lot of comic stuff in this season. So. Yeah. And I can't wait to see what they do for the spinoff next year that they said they're going to do. I'm kind of hoping it's like a prequel to the whole thing. That's you know, that's what I would like to see. I would actually like to because, OK, you got to see Rick wake up and pretty much the zombie apocalypse happened. I don't know how far it was into it. And some of that. But I would like to see, yeah, like the prequel be like everything that's like coming to it and get kind of almost kind of like if you ever got to play. If you haven't got to play, I highly recommend it. The Walking Dead video game, the Telltale one where it's like the point and click game. Kind of like that, where it's like the one guy he's going to jail. He kind of has a backstory that you don't really know. You know, then it starts happening. He gets out and it's like he has it's like all these kind of, you know, things. But it's just like the apocalypse just kind of just started right then and there with him. And I mean, you do know how long he was in the hospital, right? Rick, it was. It was 28 days later. Oh, that's right. But I'm sure it was a joke or was it? It was a joke. Oh, I feel bad. The movie 28 Days Later, where a guy goes into a coma, wakes up 28 days later. And which, by the way, was the scarecrow.",
