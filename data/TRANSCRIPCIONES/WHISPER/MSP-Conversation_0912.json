    "text": " I think, you know, you're being a little bit honest. It sort of reminds me of the episode of Being Mary Jane this last season where her producer on the show who's played, what is her name? And I can't remember her name, but she's the Latina woman who was dating a sports guy. I think he played baseball or something. He's younger than her and everything. And his style of having sex was like not her cup of tea at all. Like she was like, he's just sort of like banging it in there. And she's like, no. So she taught him, you know, how to do it, like by being honest. And at first he was a little bruised, but then she, you know, just told him like, no, it's not that I don't want it. And I think it's all in the delivery as well, you know, when it comes to honesty. I think sometimes the delivery can go a long way no matter which circumstances you are. If it's either in a relationship or if it's a relationship with a partner or a partner in a relationship. Or if it's at work, you know, and everything. I think delivery goes a long way. And so she was able to, you know, deliver it to him that she needed a little bit more, whatever she needed, and he was able to do it. And I feel like for me now, I'm sort of the same way. Like I, you know, if a guy is doing something in bed or in our relationship that is not working for me, I need to find a way to speak up and be honest because then I'm also able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. And I'm able to speak up. not giving that person the opportunity to change or to make an adjustment and say oh the way that I've been doing it's not working for her let me do it this way and that works for her you know and everything so and I'm in that way he wins I win we both win you know if you're being honest in that situation but I think when you're younger you're a little intimidated you're a little like I'm gonna scare him off or you just don't know how to say it how to be truthful about what you need in the relationship and you know when I was younger too like being honest with friends you know and stuff that got me in a lot of trouble as well like telling my friends you know what I honestly thought when especially when they sought my opinion sometimes cost me some friendships because they didn't want to hear what I had to say and so as an adult you know but I know the friends that I can be honest with you know I have friends that you know you sort of were like you know you kind of dance around the truth with them and there's some friends that I can be like direct hits like boom boom boom you know this is you know basically what I feel or how I you know think or whatever or whatever the situation is or whenever you're asking you know friends asking me an opinion I can be a straight shooter with them you know and there's some friends that ask my opinion and they don't really want the truth like but you learn that from your relationships you learn that from you know dealing with people and stuff like that so so yeah that's kind of what I think as far as relationships yeah romantic romantic relationships yeah it's hard I will say that and that's probably a reason why I'm not I do appreciate people's honesty in relationships now you know what I mean like you know I had a conversation with a guy recently who's a friend and I we were talking about you know he had been engaged before I it didn't work out and so then I was like you know I'm not gonna be able to talk to him about it and so then I was like you know I'm not gonna be able to talk to him about it and I asked him I said do you ever see yourself getting married and he said you know I don't know necessarily now at all no because I don't really have anything to bring to the table and I appreciated that honesty in him cuz not a lot of guys would say that and so it just made me see him in a whole new light and appreciate him a lot more for that candor and that you know he's just so honest about it like I don't think I would ever have expected him to even say that wow he's just yeah it was just very like okay so wow okay mm-hmm you're you know so yeah but yeah I'm still working on that with me but let me make no bones about it I am very honest when it comes to like I'm gonna affect me like sucks okay okay very oh have you always been that way or did you develop that over time always been okay if he doesn't feel good you're gonna stop or if I like it I'm gonna stop it we're gonna do more so absolutely what if it wasn't that it you know that it didn't feel good but at the same time you just weren't maybe satisfied not that it didn't feel good but you just weren't satisfied the first guy had had sex with we we had sex a couple times and this one particular time it just wasn't it and he was just like he kept feeling bad so I appreciated it that's nice but that's not maybe a touchy subject for me but going on the phone streaming too much like I started like anxious about it so I've asked him why don't you Kirk right and then like I got a little bit grew an bahrain I'm just like hey you know what\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 you know you ready we got right I certainly know how to do with these things and he was like why don't you let me do a little bit or you want double chin too because he's I'm sorry he already took it seriously yeah he was just like I'm not a big deal she about anyone can afford this she was a snooker yeah I thought it was really weird I'm so sorry I know why don't you say the truth okay gotcha so i had i was stuck so you but he was very sympathetic the fact that you know he you know finished before you he was very very so did he make it up to you that's the question i sort of tried oh boy but it didn't really work out and i just was just like i'm good so i mean but like i said it didn't take away from him because like i said i think that when you get in that situation as long as the guy is sympathetic and understanding to the girl right so he ain't gonna kiss her ass or this that and the third but just be like he was just like man i'm sorry like that well i mean i think too the fact that he was aware it's right a lot of men aren't always aware you know that you know they weren't very good or that they finished first or whatever um the case may be you know some of them just don't know they don't know that they're sucking on your nipples the wrong way you know how do you be honest about that like you know but like i said when i was younger it was tougher for me to be honest because i didn't want the guy to just leave and now i'm better with it now i'm like um be a little more gentle or more of that you know i'm very more i'm more vocal than i used to be and i think that's part of the honesty part i will say that you know i think the guys sometimes they need to work on that because like i think sometimes they're just happy i'm trying to figure out they're just happy they're happy right they're happy to be with you right they're happy to be with you right they're happy to be with you i'm thinking fox they have me that they're just like right in a moment i see what you're saying girl and then right the clothes are off and they're in bed and they're both horizontal and we they're about to get it on i think that's sometimes that's all they care about right so some of them don't really like think about like if a girl isn't doing you know like orally pleasing them the way they want right you know i think that they need to be more vocal about that right because you know i mean we all need you know refreshers I agree. And that's one thing I had noticed in my last situation. Like, I just, you need to speak up. If it's not. Right. If it's not doing it for you, let me know. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. And we apologize if there's, like, these sirens going, if you guys can hear that in the background. So please excuse it. Yes, please do. We've done everything we can to seal that off. But I hate to say this, but this is Chicago. We are Chicago. So, yeah. But I, yeah, I don't know. Like I said, it's a twofer. But I've never had a guy say that, you know. I remember one time a guy looked like he was offended when I, he just assumed that I, I mean, I don't know. It was oral. And he didn't think that I gave, he was just like, do you or do you not give whatevers. And I just really didn't say anything. Blowjob? Yeah. I just didn't really say anything. And so he was just looking at me like, I can't believe this shit. And this, that, and the third. And I was just like. I said, well, do you do it? And then you know what his answer was? Absolutely not. Oh, so he doesn't return the favor. No. So guess what? Then you shouldn't get, you shouldn't get none either. I mean, that's a whole. But how's that for honesty? Right. And I was just like, but like I said, I never said anything either way, whether or not I, you know, did or didn't. Right. So, like I said, but he just was really offended when he just assumed, you know. Interesting. I was just like, I didn't say anything. Interesting. I'm not going to say anything now. I'm not ever going to say anything. Right. Right. Right. Interesting. I mean, we'll talk about that oral stuff later. Later. That's a good topic, actually. It is. Absolutely. I agree. Yeah. We need to talk about it. Maybe, and then I'm thinking with that, we should bring in a sexpert, like from one of these area shops. Because Chicago has like, well, I'm sure every city has a ton of shops. Right. But that would be a good one. But yeah. So, you know, honesty in the bedroom. It could go, it needs to go both ways. I agree. I agree. Both ways in the bedroom, in your relationship, you know, communication. And being honest to think about what you want as well. Like, I think if you don't speak up as well and say, you know, this is what I need, then how is the other person supposed to even be able to come meet you halfway if they think everything's fine, however everything's not fine. So that's a lie in itself. Right. For the other person to think everything's fine and you're like, no, it's not fine. But you don't tell them. Right. Exactly. Or you don't bring it up. So, yeah. So the moral or the on the end note is what we'll say is honesty is always the best policy. To a certain degree. With certain people. With certain people. Yeah. In certain situations. But I don't consider you a friend if I have to lie to you. Right. No, me neither. I agree too. And I know from, like I said, my past experience now, like I said, especially, and we didn't cover this, like work friendships or work relationships. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I lie. I like the Dickens now. And I will, I will always lie. Like I've had lessons learned. And so now it's going to lie, lie till I die. Yeah. Work relationships are tricky. Like, you know, before we close out, like work relationships are tricky. I think, you know, you, for some reason in the work environment, honesty is not always the best policy. You know, I, there was a place that I worked at before and the boss would want to tell these jokes. And I was like, okay, I'm going to tell these jokes that I didn't find funny. And because I didn't laugh at the jokes, which was me being honest, I got labeled like, oh, she's just standoffish. She's not a fun person. Basically, they couldn't read me. And so because they couldn't read me, I was a problem. So I think work situations are very tricky. You have to play this game, you know, this political game or whatever, and you can't tell everyone the truth. You know, there was another job. I was in a job where the boss was always like upset whenever I was like taking vacation and I was going to places that he didn't think I should be able to go to. Like it was the, oh, it was the weirdest thing. And so then I was just like, you know, and I'm not going to tell you where I'm going anymore because you know what, honestly, it's none of your business. I'm just taking vacation. How about that? You know, because then you want it to be, you want to be kind of conversational, you know, oh, you're going to where, oh, you're going to, you know, what did you do this weekend? That sort of thing. I cut off. I'll communication with this boss. And he was pissed. He was like, why isn't she talking to me? Why isn't she this mess? And I'm like, I can't, I can't do that. However, in a workplace, you need to sort of get along to get along, get along to move along. Yeah. I'm fine with that until it comes to, they start to question your work ethic and your character. Right. And that's the, an issue I had had my previous job. Like I just wasn't meeting. I was, you know, my supervisor and, you know, she was a very, very sensitive, insecure person, pathetic person as well. And I just felt like, you know, once our, whatever quasi friendship was cut off, it just, it just became horrible. And like I said, just not even that's in the past moving forward. Cause she, that doesn't even deserve my lip service and it's not going to get it anymore. Um, and you know, I don't dwell on stuff, but like I said, with that whole work situation, that situation taught me that I need to lie, lie till I die. Like very insecure people, unfortunately you work with and you can't really gauge them. And I was surrounded by a ton of insecure people that I worked with directly that, you know, you just can't, you know, it is what it is. It is. It is. It's, I mean, I don't like playing games and I'm not good at playing games and, and it resulted in my downfall at that position because I just, I don't share a couple. And like I said, I just, I'm not good at being fake and phony and playing games. But like I said, I've, I've fine tuned those skills now, I guess you could say. So let the games begin. You know what I mean? In certain situations, I think, especially like in the work environment, sometimes you do have to play those stupid games, which it's unfortunate in itself, you know? Yeah. It's very unfortunate. So, yeah. So on that note, um, Oh, so I don't even know where to start. I mean, there are just so many things from funk master flags to this whole FBI director being fired. Oh yeah. That thing. That one. There's just so many, many, many what the fucks. I don't know what to say or do. So I'm just like, I mean, come on. Can we start in the theme of being honesty is the best policy. What about stage or party? That's a what? Fake. Draft. Parts. Right. The lines. Her. Okay. Yeah. That'll be my what the fuck. Let's start that one. That'll, we'll just, yeah. Since it's honesty, we'll just do that as one of my what the fucks. Yes. My what the fuck period. Right. Oh, period. We'll just do that. Okay. So yeah. Um, for those of you who do not watch and we've stated on a past episode, our shows, and I watch most of the housewives shows on Bravo TV. Right. Um, um, this is a free, they're not paying me. So just FYI. Um, it was, um, I don't know. I don't know. It was finally revealed in the four parts. Uh, gosh, they dragged that shit out way too long. Oh my God. It was finally revealed that there was a rumor that had started circulating mid season with Candy Burris. Um, one of the housewives, um, former, um, she was a member of escape. Right. Not together. So there was a rumor that she was going to, or had intention to turn her husband Todd of drugging and raping one of the other housewives of Portia. Right. What is her name? Portia Williams. Yeah. Portia Williams or whatever. And so, um, no one knew where, who started the rumor. All Portia said when she met with Candy was that she had heard on the street or she had heard that that's what they intended to do with her. Right. Exactly. Candy and Todd, husband and wife were going to drug her and rape her in their sex dungeon. Right. Yes. Exactly. Sex dungeon. Let's not forget that. Let's not forget that sex dungeon that Candy's got. So, um, you know, like I said, that was a rumor. That played out and it went through the entire, like mid, started mid season, went out the rest of the season. So the reunion in the three, at the end of the third part of the reunion of four parts, uh, Portia said that she was served a cease and desist by Candy. Right. And so she was going to, um, you know, let Phaedra Parks take it from there cause she wasn't going to speak on it anymore cause Phaedra, I guess, was her legal representation. And Phaedra was also the one that told her firsthand personally that that's what Candy told her. That she had Candy. And so Candy and Todd, her husband, were going to do this. See? Portia. Mm. Mm. Mm. So then this past Sunday, it all came to a head. Yes, it did. So we finally found out who started this bullshit rumor and who said it. And it was her former, now Candy and Phaedra were BFFs. And I'm just giving this backstory to people who like, could care less about the housewives, but it's important to note that Candy and Phaedra were friends. Were. For quite a few years. Yes. On the housewives. Yes. Very, very close. Very, very good friends. And so they had had a falling out. And they never got back to where they were. Right. And so they were both just very cordial. Although Phaedra took digs throughout the entire season, I feel, at Candy. She did. Whenever she could. She did. She did. And so, you know, Candy just kept it cute. And their relationship, too, is a classic example of what we were talking about in terms of friendships, you know. So Phaedra, you know, is going through this thing with her husband who got arrested for fraud. Right? For fraud or money. Money laundering and fraud. And fraud. Right. It's a couple different things. So he got. So while she was going through that, you know, she's telling the whole world, woe is me, woe is me. And so everyone's like, how are you doing? How are you, you know, hanging up? Or how are you basically holding up? And so then she says, but Candy, who's supposed to be her best friend, her good friend, was not doing that. And Candy was like, no. We talked, you know, and everything. And when we talked, basically, it was revealed this season that when they talked. You know, and everything. She was just like, girl, it's all good. I'm going to be married within the year. I'm going to this and this. So if you and your good friend, your close friend, are talking and you tell your friend, oh, girl, I'm going to be good. I'm going to be married within the year. Blah, blah, blah. But you're telling the outside world. You're telling everybody else. You're like, woe is me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. How is your friend supposed to know that you are really hurting if that's, quote, unquote, what you're doing? If that's what's happening to you? Are you really hurting? Because when we're talking, you're like, girl, I'm fine. I'm going to be married within the year. Blah, blah, blah. But everybody else, to everyone else, you're like, woe is me. Woe is me. Woe is me. So you're showing two faces. And then when someone says, you know, has Candy been around because they haven't seen Candy? You, the friend that you've been having conversations with your friend, Candy, can't say, oh, yeah, Candy and I have been talking. She's, yeah, she totally knows she's on board. But she's also dealing with her own personal whatever. You're not saying any of that. You're just saying, yeah. Candy hasn't been here. Really? Really? Like, yeah. That really rubbed my, rubbed me the wrong way. Because I'm like, if to meet me and you are friends and we're having a private conversation and to me, you're saying, yeah, I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be married at the top of the year. Blah, blah, blah. I can't wait till he's gone. All this stuff. But to the outside world, you're showing another face. Then I have a problem. So, yeah. So they discussed all that on there. But like I said, the stunning conclusion. Was, like I said, Phaedra was the one that started the rumor. Yeah. And so it all came to a head. Candy, you know, was just upset. Which rightfully she should be. And now I heard that she's just like, considering taking legal action. Which I think she absolutely should. And then Portia is just the victim. She was manipulated. Blah, blah, blah. Crying crocodile tears. Blah, blah, blah. So, yeah. The what the fuck in that was. I, NeNe Leakes was on Watch What Happens Live. The show after. Oh, was she? Yeah. And so she. She feels as though that both Phaedra and Portia concocted this. And that Phaedra was the one that ended up taking the fall.",
