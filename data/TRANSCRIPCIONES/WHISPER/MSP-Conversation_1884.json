    "text": " I'm speaking with Andrew Parker, Chief of UNICEF Field Office in Vanuatu, about the volcanic eruption recently on Ambai Island. Thank you, Andrew, for agreeing to speak with me today. Could you give us a bit of background first, where the island is, what happened, and the reason for the people to leave? Thank you, Julia. The island of Ambai is quite central to Vanuatu as far as the country goes, but relative to the capital is around about 400 kilometers north of us. It lies as one of three islands in Panama province, and most of all of the islands in Vanuatu are volcanic in origin of some type and time. And what actually happened? The volcano hasn't actually blown up per se. The volcano crater is actually a lake, and so the gas release and the volcanic release out of the volcano comes through water and therefore forms very fine ash. That ash then obviously gets blown downwind with the surface winds, and during major activity periods it gets blown fairly high. And then it gets blown up into the atmosphere and gets caught by whichever wind direction is blowing at that level. Just in terms of the volcano, what does it look like as a situation for people? If you picture one of the Nordic states or Canada during a snowstorm with a meter of snow over the top of roofs and so forth, but you convert that white to black, we have fairly strong imagery of people walking around with umbrellas in what would normally be considered to be sort of dusk or dark because it cuts out the light. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. The difference with crops, of course, although, again, snow burns crops, ash tends to be a little bit acidic, so all vegetation tends to be defoliated. One of the consequences that we've encountered is that ash fall in waterways tends to, and I'm not sure the exact science behind it, but it tends to increase the viscosity of the mud that's created during a rainstorm. And as a result, there have been a couple of flash floods that took out a couple of communities, although without a drastic loss of life. What effect does it have on people's health? Get in behind a vehicle in bulldust and you're into the same sort of breathing conditions. How do you evacuate a whole island of people? So if you imagine a landing craft arriving on a beach, there being very few wharfs and ports. A landing craft arrives, lays down its loading door at the front, and people stream on with their baggage. What work has UNICEF been doing? As with all situations, crises that involve children, UNICEF primarily looks at issues around the vulnerability of children, the increased vulnerability of children, and changes to basic services for children. So in this particular context, we have been supporting... We have been supporting the health sector and Ministry of Health, and we have a fairly substantive focus on immunization. So in this particular context, helping the government move the provincial store of vaccines and facilities from Ambaie, because the provincial capital is on Ambaie and will have to be relocated. Nutrition, we're watching the situation. Vanuatu has a fairly high prevalent percentage of stunted children. So it doesn't take much. It doesn't take much for those children to slip down into a state of concern in terms of nutrition. So we're watching that situation with the government. In terms of child protection, there has been in child protection a fairly broad spectrum of concerns around children. Assisting the government around registration and the issuance of ID cards. The support to Ministry of Youth and Sports with Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Save the Children and others around psychosocial support. The support to the community and to children. The creation of child-friendly spaces and the support to child-friendly spaces. Just on that, just on the stress and trauma for everybody, but particularly for children. I think it's difficult for everybody. And if one reflects on a community as an entity and from personal experience, I know that if children are involved in a traumatic event, the whole community finds it very difficult to function. Until those children are being treated. Not only the children being children again and laughing and playing as children, so the mental state of children and the ability of children to feel safe enough to function as children again is a critical component in any community being functional and some cohesion and recovery, if you want to use that term, occurring. Until that occurs, a community is almost paralysed. So the state of mind of children in any emergency is of absolute critically, of a critical nature for all aspects of response. water and sanitation. Are you doing any work? Absolutely. That's a mainstay of UNICEF's humanitarian response globally. In the context of the Ambi response, we're supporting the Department of Water, which has primary responsibility for all things water, and the Ministry of Health that has responsibility for hygiene and sanitation, with both coordination of the response itself and the injection of support from various parties, but also with on-ground action to increase water supply to those communities that are hosting. And there's a major program ongoing to install pit latrines in Maiwu just to contain any sanitation-related concerns. How do you integrate people into another community in these circumstances well, so everybody has what they need? The population and the communities in Vanuatu tend to be very strong in that regard. The welcome and the hosting open-door policy within communities is well known. Though, as with anywhere in the world, I'm sure one can outstay one's welcome. So I think where we are looking to support government and the communities is to make sure that before that welcome is exhausted, that the communities that have arrived or the popular households that have arrived are not now continuing to draw on and become relatively self-sufficient or self-standing. So we have a period of welcome in which to try and get that right. Do you think that people will go back? Can they go back? Under the state of emergency, Ambai is evacuated. Once the state of emergency expires in September, we wait to see what the final situation will be. The government has made clear that it will be moving the provincial capital and services off that island. And so if people do return, then we may see a situation where people are returning to an island where basic services from government are absent and they need to travel to other islands to be able to return. I think that's going to be a really difficult time, because the government will be taking the best outcome. So I guess sectorially, we would be trying to ensure that all children that have moved from Ampai are accepted into and are receiving education in schools in their host communities. We would be seeking to ensure that the government has the ability to offer health services that stand at the level at or above previously received in Ampai. We would be also trying to ensure that in provision of basic services that there is no negative impact on the children. So I think that's on the host communities. We would also be supporting the government to monitor the nutritional status of children in particular. And so best case scenario is we're six months in, people are static, people have settled children, they're in school, receiving health and psychological support as necessary. And the integration of those communities, those households within their receiving communities has become real. They're not considered to be absolute outsiders after a period of time. We hope that the situation on Ambai, of course, settles down and that the government's projected second home concept whereby people on Ambai retain their first home on Ambai but have the option to have a safe refuge elsewhere. We hope that becomes a reality because Ambai is important for the people of Ambai. For many cultural reasons and otherwise, our status in the country is very closely linked to land as well. So to be totally dislocated for Ambai is not a desirable outcome for anybody. So we're hoping Ambai itself settles down to the degree that that can be achieved. Long-term challenges now? A situation like Ambai is always going to throw up long-term challenges, primarily around uncertainty, but also around some pragmatic details. The seat of government for that position is going to be a very, very important one. The province which consists of three islands, Ambai, Maiwo and Pentecost, has always been on Ambai. That seat of government, the provincial government headquarters is closed along with the provincial hospital. All are supposed to be relocated and recreated on another island, Pentecost. At the moment, there is no provincial hospital for that population of approximately 20,000. So at the moment, everybody from that province that needs hospitalization, hospital care is having to be flown out either to the northern hospital in Luganville, or to the south to Port Vila. So overall, speaking about this challenge, particularly about the hospital, what would UNICEF like to see? Ideally, we would like to see a swift resolution to the absence of a hospital. Realistically, that's unlikely given that the infrastructure has to start from scratch on Pentecost Island and the likelihood of the hospital in Ambai being reopened is probably pretty low. So realistically, we would like to ensure that the communications, between health staff at the community level and the health authorities, able to facilitate emergency or critical transport of pregnant women requiring support. We'd like to see that prioritized and optimized so that those mothers are not negatively impacted and their children are not negatively impacted by the situation.",
