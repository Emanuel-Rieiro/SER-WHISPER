    "text": " I saw there was really a plethora of material that really hadn't got very organized somehow, or really, some of it was really not very well referenced. And usually it was the same kind of bibliographic kind of references that you could find on artist books, or books on artist books. So I started digging and I started accumulating a number of books on artist books. And then I had so much stuff that in a way I had to kind of find a way of organizing all of that material. And in the end I decided to go for very simple bibliographic categories. So I kind of divided all the things that I got into exhibition catalogs, reference catalogs, collection catalogs, artist monographs, publisher's monographs. There's a little section on artist books on books, which is maybe another one. There's a little section on periodicals and publisher's catalogs, and yearbooks and fair catalogs, then dealership catalogs. So all of these things were selected primarily for the quality of bibliographic information. So essentially just description of artist books, or books published by artist extent since, I guess, the early 70s. So the beginning of the research really was put upon this. So this is a book called The Book as Artwork, which is probably one of the first exhibition of artist books by Jamal Ocelant in Nigel Greenwood Gallery in London. But there are a few publications that pre-existed which are kind of interesting to us. So in the end what it is, is a kind of reference book, which is very basic in that it doesn't actually, it doesn't really describe what's inside the book. It just gives you the title, who the editor was, or the editor or the author was, who the publisher, where it was published, the date it was published, the size, the number of pages, and more or less the format, whether it's hardback, softback. And then there's an illustration. So usually a double spread and a cover. So it's just a little visual index to be able maybe to recognize that book if you ever came across it. Yeah. I'm really familiar with the book. I'm really familiar with the book. To me it wasn't about creating some kind of critical overview of the discourse on artist books. It was much more about kind of looking at these printed traces that documented artist books at the time and in a period where a lot of that information was actually moving online. So today rather than kind of printing a catalog or printing a list, people just send a PDF or they send a file or they send an email. And so all of that information, rather than actually be printed, rather than actually being materialized like artist books were in printed form, they're kind of dematerialized. They're online as kind of information. So yeah. So in the end you can think that there's two types of artist books. There are the artist books that have been kind of cataloged and described in books on artist books. And there are the artist books that haven't been cataloged or referenced in any publication. So taking stock of all the books on artist books in a way would give possibly an overview of everything that's been referenced so far as far as kind of artist publishing in North America and Europe is concerned. And then maybe there's like other things that have never been referenced. So it was also a way of kind of maybe trying to see the kind of current status of knowledge about what artist publishing had been in the last 50 years. So yeah, so I think that's it. I think that's where I'll stop. Anybody's got a question? Can you talk about the first time you presented the project you did? Like there's the really nice poster. And there was a, it started first as a poster, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the first time I presented it was really as an exhibition. So it was as an exhibition. So this is really the book on books on artist books. It's just like one bibliographic list of, like, books. It gets to the first edition, which is, this is a slightly expanded second edition. And so it was an exhibition of the books that, some of the books that I had. So the key here is in red are the books that were exhibited. In red, in black with a red shadow are the books that were actually available on tables, reading tables in the space of the gallery. So you could actually interact with some of this material. And in black, the books that I included in the book are artist books. So it was a show. Yeah. And inside the show, the book was produced, the first edition of the book was actually produced inside the show. So inside the show, there was a kind of material production of the books. The book was actually printed, bound, trimmed, and made available to the public inside the gallery. And because it was free, I kind of set up a system where people had to, you know, write a little slip and then come back two weeks later to get the book. Because if you get free stuff, usually people just take it. They don't really care about it. So I needed to have a sort of a threshold to kind of, to, they had to, say the public had to work a little bit harder to get a copy somehow. And in that exhibition, which lasted for about five weeks, six weeks, we made about 250 copies. And because it was a commission, I managed to get all the equipment back in the studio afterwards. So in a way, it was a good thing. So in a way, that show kind of set me up to also be able to produce books afterwards. So now I've got, I've got, the Everyday Press is kind of running on two different kind of levels somehow. So I've got, you know, I've got a printer and a binder and a guillotine, which means that some books that are here, for example, are things that I can make very quickly in the studio. And very immediate projects that I work at with different people, artists, curators, people who come to me about publishing. And then the Everyday Press also kind of publishes things. Which I love. I love the fact that it's kind of official with an ISBN and things that are, you know, properly distributed and released. Things like that, for example. Which is another thing I did earlier. Yeah. It's like the first English translation of the book I was writing. Yeah. Which you did earlier. Yeah, books. I mean, you know, so books and publishing books has been my interest. So it's, yeah, it takes different forms and has different kind of interest in the printed form. I think it's fantastic to be invited by Cathy because I really, I really like read books. I really like the selection she's got. I think it's an amazing space for kind of, you know, discovering and encountering kind of art in a way. And I think art in book form, whether it's an artist's book or a publication or a catalogue or a monograph, for me has always been the first port of call. This is how I kind of encountered art in the first instance. And yes, you can see, you know, works and installation and pieces in the flesh in galleries and museums. But it happens in book form. Can I ask questions? So do you see, I mean, you're describing this book as not really telling us too much about the books and so on. Do you see, or the way I see it doesn't matter? Certainly. I don't know if you see it that way. But it seems like you're giving books on artist books a dose of its own medicine. Yeah, in a way, because it is, you know, an accumulation or a listing of books doesn't kind of replace the books. And I think in a sense you could argue that artist books are wholly absent from that book, you know. And in a way it's the case, but it's not really the case. They're kind of, so it's a mise en a bide, you know. So you have like this image and then you have an image within an image and an image, the image within the image. Yeah. And in a way the artist book there kind of recedes, it kind of moves away from what you're holding, except that this is kind of an artist book as well. So it kind of loops onto itself. And also a lot of these catalogues sometimes have, you know, covers by artists or they kind of design by the artist. And if you take this example of, that's an Art Metropole exhibition catalogue from 1980, which again kind of re-publishes the book. And you have Hans Hacker. So, you know, it becomes a Hans Hacker book or, you know, in a way the kind of contribution that artists put into these things. There's a proximity in a way from artist books to books on artist books. And in a way all of these things kind of work together somehow up to a point, maybe up to today somehow, you know. So, yeah, I think that's the case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But here's my point about the informational mobs versus the literary sites, Have you got some sort of of a critique of mechanisms that literature has as we maybe as testers in work with some sort of self reaction by artists to those things? I mean I think I think you've done a very attractive piece of criticism where I was given back a blank paper sleigh and I was given backThere was a three page diary about writing and I would stop and read it. Right. Well, I don't know, like the fox, you recruited the fox, you know, and it's a bootleg. I mean, it's very generous and it seems to go back to maybe the heart and the intentions once upon a time, you know, but it's kind of, there's something, yeah, it's interesting.",
