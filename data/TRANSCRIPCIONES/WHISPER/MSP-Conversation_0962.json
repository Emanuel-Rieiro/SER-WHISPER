    "text": " When I started at the bottom of the camera department, as a sort of trainee, there was already a woman who was further along in the camera assistant experience, but she left to become a firewoman, and then there was nobody. There had been women camera operators and women doing, such as Margaret Moth, doing her current affairs and news shooting, but what I was doing, I had no role model for it, and it was, I think I'd been in the industry for about 20 years before I met my first woman cinematographer. Right, right. So it was a lone kind of battle, and that's taught me a lot, really, about rediscovering how to work with people, you know, how to give people a sort of a hand. I see it that we're kind of, in a sense, on either sides of the riverbank. When you're looking at other, someone's over there, they're other. Right. And I think the mainstream or people in power have to learn how to give a hand out and yonk people over to the solid ground where they're at somehow. Right. It's a kind of generous attitude, I suppose, to have, but it's difficult in an industry with very high stakes. Fame and fortune, and the opposite is penury and infamy. Sounds like you've worked with a... Quite a spread of people, people like Marita Meeta and Chris Krause, even, I think, maybe. Yes, yeah. You know, they're not figures of the mainstream, one would say. No, no, no, no. No, that's right. Marita, I worked with her a few times. I remember her making a huge impact on me physically to do with her level of power, confidence. And I think the reason why she chose to work with me was because she was Maori, clearly, but a feminist. Right. And we talked at length at times when we would be driving long distances. We would talk at length about that. And I think things have changed somewhat, but not a lot, to be honest. Luckily, people can pick up a camera and go again as they could back in, really, the 70s. People were able to do that. Alternative cinema, there was a lot of sort of cranky old bolexes lying around and a few hand-driven pick sinks and whatnot. Right. TVNZ would process our film for free. And now we're back to that freedom again, you know, with little SD cards to record onto. And people can edit at home and whatnot. It's empowering. Yes. But it doesn't really act against the hegemony of men who have still got the purse strings in the mainstream industry. Now, Common Ground touches on both your Scottish ancestry and the land clearances there, which we'll come to, and also the M\u0101ori experience. And it sounds like your journey towards this also came into your experience with documentary filmmaking in the Far North and M\u0101ori communities. I wondered if you could introduce how you sort of became. more involved in, I guess, the land movement in a way. It must have been something subconscious or conscious. Who knows? But as a trainee technician, when Don Selwyn started his film school down here, W\u0101taro, in the Freemans Bay Community Centre, all those people became my friends. And we were united in a way. I think we had very similar priorities. It was very relationship-based in that we would hang out together. We'd eat together. It was a wonderful time, in a sense. And I felt in alignment. We had values. I remember taking a copy of Peter Watkins' Culloden down to W\u0101taro, and Don Selwyn would say to me, you know, you support our kaupapa, we support yours. Those moments are really, they fill you up, because you have to, if you're a sort of an activist and someone who is pioneering, you have to be pretty strong. And nobody's that strong. I mean, we all need to be, you know, occasionally kind of bolstered or reminded that other people. We're out there on our wavelength. But if you were in the far north, for example, I would imagine not only are you sort of on an outsider as a woman with the camera, but also within a M\u0101ori community. How was that as an experience? I was making a music video for Lips and made a music video for Big Belly Woman in the Hokianga. The vocalist's Vera, her son, was killed in a car accident that night. And when you share experience. With people. When it's not just an academic exercise or a nice idea. When you're in a place with people, that's when things happen. That seemed to be, on the face of it, maybe domestic or, well, certainly with Vera's son's death, that was something that was epic. And there we were. Karen already had a fire at her place that day. There was a whole lot going on. And we were together as a group. And at times like that, what becomes important really is shared priorities. And that's a way of being in the world, which is kind of encouraging and mutually supportive. I think then really I was kind of accepted into part of the M\u0101ori world. I don't know, I felt comfortable, just very comfortable. I still do. But I mean, I know that there is, people don't believe in inverse racism. They say that if you're white, racism doesn't affect you because you're so privileged. And that's an interesting discussion to be had, I think. Because certainly when you're a woman, you're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not a woman. You're not fighting against the odds. You don't feel privileged. I feel more privileged now than I ever have. But that's not how I've felt in my life, when you've been squatting and up against it in different ways. Yeah, so it's not always easy, but I like to have those difficult conversations, because I think we need to. I think you co-produced it, there's a documentary about Lake \u014cmapere. Yes, it was called Restoring the M\u0101ori of Lake \u014cmapere. And that happened because Karen was keyboard. She's a keyboard clubber. and big belly woman and she's a kind of enthusiast so she's on the phone saying the lakes polluted it's polluting our river we've got to make a documentary and we've got to make it now so that's kind of how that happened and I'd never produced anything really formally in my life Simon Mahler was a co-producer he had worked in production not in the documentary though I don't think Karen just wanted to do film but it always done music so every all of us were doing jobs that we'd never well we were stepping up and it gave me a real look into how it could be if I did my own work I think and now we are here there's the word artist as well as cinematographer and I've been doing an MFA as well that was an M Phil and I've started my PhD at Elam right the architecture school right how are you finding that transition into the heady world of the visual arts if I think about it I feel nervous I suppose because it's unknown and I I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm doing I know that people anything that has a hierarchy attached to it or that can be elitist to me it just rings warning bells because I know that that way of working which I think has been somehow magnified with neoliberalism yes and supported by I suppose capitalism and some would say that kind of cut and thrust of competition I feel strongly that we have to relearn how to be cooperative and it does take relearning because we're so hardwired to compete and it's a sort of a consciousness and awareness of being inclusive whereas our feeling as all you know there's not room for two of us necessarily and so you know I might lose this contest so what's so why do it why play the game and do the academic site and we're not in a great time necessarily to do with funding of feature-length documentaries I mean Maori TV was just phenomenal there's a purse strings problem I said There is a purse strings problem! I said there was a purse strings problem. I feel that we almost need a return to some kind of a fee system, like we had the broadcasting fee, and maybe work in some way as they still do in parts of Europe. I'm not sure that that's the only way to go, but certainly having been affected by television and the loss of the concept of public service, or any kind of service really, that's really been damaging to my career, I have to say, because when I was moving and shooting lots of short films, and then the feature that you mentioned with Chris Kraus and another one here, the natural progression would have been into doing TV drama. Yes. And just at that time, there was a huge gap, several years, where they didn't make any. And then in that interim, I kind of thought, well, I'm better working in the factual realm anyway, and I'm really happy working with other people's ideas. Returning to university was a good thing for me to do, because it coincided with a time when wellbeing, and I was really lucky to be working with a person who had a knack for empowerment. It's one of those words that makes it seem as though he's given me something, and now I'm all powerful. But it's just to do with finding something that's yours. Yes. But at the same time, I mean, we have a two-screen work here at the P\u0101 Homestead, but you could be reaching far more people on M\u0101ori television. Yes, that's true. So, I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. That's a very good point. I think the fact that it's a different aspect ratio, instead of 16 by 9, it's 48 by 9. The stories could sit alone, but it's the beginning of me stepping away from this very standard aspect ratio of the screen, and moving more into an area where it could be in a museum, or a gallery, or a community space, and be working with the community to tell stories in that way. It's the beginning of me moving into, I think, a new and immersive world. I mean, the way that this was screened, that Common Ground is screened, to supposedly give the viewer a sense that they might be meeting these people in their landscape. You've got one large screen with, I guess, what we'll call the central documentary, as it were, with the interviews and the waiata and some landscape. You've also got a panorama-shaped long screen, which is quite unusual to one side and another wall. Yes. When it initially screened, there were four walls. So the stories are six stories, three M\u0101ori, three from Highlands of Scotland. They don't call themselves Highlanders, they call themselves Gaels, from Gaelic. So the stories were being told alternatively, as you would find in a p\u014dwhiri. I mean, some marae, they have all stories told from one side and all from the other side, but I've gone with the alternate, just so that walkers, you know, people that come in, coming into the gallery, you know, they know what's going on before they decide to leave. And then the long screens were the same, alternating between Scotland and up in the H\u014dkeana. I think we should tell people a little bit more about the film, actually, in terms of why you brought these two elements together. And I guess that sort of completes your journey, maybe a little bit, in terms of your Scottish ancestry. Well, it's true. I was in Scotland in 2012 and was starting to read about, well, to think about what I might do for my master's project, I suppose. And I met an elderly activist who'd written a book called Stolen Land, Stolen Lives, by Shirley-Anne Hardy. And I realised then that this was very important, because the loss of access to land is causing poverty. And it coincided with me discovering another book, Alastair Macintosh, Soil and Soul. And he is a radical human ecologist. He calls himself a pre-modern thinker. And he is looking at the world, looking at indigenous philosophy, indigenous world views, and indigenous ways of being in the world. And he talks about a sort of a Celtic idea of trinity and the relationship between people, land, or the environment, and the unseen realm. And I discovered that in my own genealogy, in my own whakapapa, that my father's people had had their land taken from them during the clearances. And many of them were kind of left or went to the coast or went to the city. And they were left to sort of become the new proletariat. So they were miners and in a poorhouse, very, very, very poverty-stricken. So when you don't have access to land, that's your... How can you put food on the table if you can't grow it or swap it? And, you know, in a way, it's me finding a way to survive in the world where I can... I've always been a researcher, to be honest, just sort of quietly. And now it kind of gives me a framework and allows me to do that. I've got... You know, I'm reading, but, yes, I'm researching. Who are your subjects in Common Ground? You say there's three stories from Scotland, three from here. Yes. Edi Harpiti Morgan, she was in Restoring the M\u0101ori of Lake Waum\u0101pere. She had done a lot of research about the lake. She should get an honorary PhD, really. And a deep thinker. But I think when she agrees to do something, if she can see worth in it, then she will do it. So she's the lady in the yellow sweater. She's the lady in the yellow swan dry, talking about how her mother addresses the mountain every day. Yes. Noa Pera was also in our lake, Waum\u0101pere Doko, the carver. He was telling a lot of stories, really, about landmarks in Rawene. Like a little building there was actually the jail house. Stories, again, about land being stolen, really. People being told, well, you can go to the gum fields, or you can go to prison. But whatever you do, we're going to take your land anyway. And Reva, it just kind of happened on her one day. And she's such an astonishing person, doing her weaving and talking about her uncle. So they're all in my circle, because since I started going up to Rawene in 2005 to do the doko, I've been going up now. This is the 12th year that I've been going up. Yeah, so it's been quite a long, long... It has. Yeah, friendships and relationships. It has. And I've tried to tell the story about the Scottish people a bit more quickly, I suppose. In 2012, when I got my driving job in Scotland, I was in the car, and I was driving around the country. And I had one job in Scotland that allowed me to go up to the far north and also to a Klan gun society gathering. I realised what was going on with the Klan societies and how, again, it's another hierarchy for those who fetishise such things. And there was a gentleman there who wanted and has now become chief. We were being taught about the clearances in such a way that it could be just tucked away again on a shelf and forgotten about. But at that game, we were taught that we could do it. But at that gathering, I met a woman, because he was saying to me that, no, the guns didn't speak Gaelic. And there was a woman who stood and said, well, I'm a gun and I speak Gaelic. And so did my grandmother and da-da-da-da-da. So I took down her email address and then contacted her again. So there's powerful stories there of, you know, in Common Ground, in the film, around, you know, looking at forests that are, you know, owned by footballers and so forth. Oh, George Gunn. He is... I just happened upon him. When I came home to New Zealand after that visiting, thinking, I can't get what I want from the society anymore. They don't want to know the true history or they won't help. They're not an ally as far as my hunt goes for what really went on. So I just emailed... I just found his name on the internet and emailed him. And he became my teacher. Read this, read that. I never met him. And then when we bowled up and said, well, George, do you mind if we film you? And he was fantastic. How he can encapsulate all of that because he's a writer. And the last one, I was researching my dad's family tree, trying to find out, you know, where they were living before the clearances. Neil McLeod was just at the Dunbeith Heritative Centre. And when I heard his voice and his accent, and I could feel how kind of internal and restrained he is, I just asked if I could film him. And so I only knew him for two minutes, really. Incredibly generous. Some people need to tell stories. It's a sort of healing thing, I think. So Common Ground, the title sort of answers my question a little bit, but I'm wondering what you... you would hope that bringing the M\u0101ori and the Scottish stories together will do for people encountering it here at the P\u0101 homestead or wherever else. I'm really concerned that we cease this kind of superficial black and white thinking because it's hugely problematic. And if people can be satisfied with some kind of an explanation which means these people are good and those people are bad, and it revolves around colour somehow, that's really problematic for me. Because I feel that at one point we were all connected to a place somewhere, but many of us have forgotten that, or it hasn't been mentioned or it's been hidden. M\u0101ori are right still in the middle of it. We're supposed to be post-colonial. I don't really get that. And there's a lot of pain, and it's understandable. A lot of people who are Scottish have got big blanks in their family histories. There's a lot of shame there about, oh, that was really careless. I lost my culture. I lost my language. I don't really know where I'm from. So there's two things there. People start to realise that the stories of the M\u0101ori that live next door or whoever are similar to the ones of their ancestors, but there's also kind of, well, do I know my ancestors' stories? It's easy for European stories to become regurgitated, stylised ideas of goodies and baddies and all of that because we don't know our stories. Mm. And if we were reconnected to them more, I think we'd be more compassionate and just more authentic. You mentioned in some writing around here the sort of interest in realising you even used that word, relational, which is quite a buzzword in terms of art practice. Is it? Well, I don't know. It's a wonderful word, but, you know, it signifies that the art is as much about relationships as, say, objects. Is that the case for you? Is that how you see the art practice in a way? It is for me. Could I call myself a documentary maker? Some people would probably call me that. That'd be fine. That's probably not all I am, but I do make a lot of docos and work on a lot of docos. And it's all about relationship. And you can arrive and sort of park on the footpath and come steaming in with your gun, you know, all guns blazing, and expect people to do your will and then drive off again, but you go back to that place, you're not going to have a relationship. Mm. We need to learn how to reconnect. We really have forgotten. We really have forgotten, and we're also terrified. There's a whole lot of clich\u00e9s about stay away from your neighbours or the public, oh, the public, well, you wouldn't want to go there. It's incredible. What I noticed with Common Ground is once people had been in there watching it together as a group in chairs swivelling around or wandering about, this has been the first showing with the four screens. Right. When they came out, I had a conversation pit. Not that I constructed it because I knew that I needed one, it was just by chance, and boy, we really needed it. A lot of people were weeping. It was totally irrelevant whether they had M\u0101ori or Scottish blood. People were weeping about Croatia. What musicians needed to talk about the pentatonic scale and the, you know, some of the singing in Scotland. It was mind-boggling. So I wouldn't do it again without having a real meeting place. M\u0101ori Gun, thank you for joining us on CircuitCast. It's been a pleasure to have you here. Kia ora. Thank you. Thank you very much.",
