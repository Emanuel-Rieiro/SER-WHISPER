    "text": " the setup is that they um move to a town in texas where it's called like i forget the name of it but um uh it's like hardened texas yeah and they call it miracle texas because no one um vanished in that town like no one was raptured or taken or whatever the hell um in this town so it's become this kind of place that people have been like flocking to so her and justin moved to this town with his daughter and then that baby that was on their step yeah um and like start trying to like start over there so i'm very curious to see like and then there's the new family yeah regina king and uh her husband and twin i think it's a boy and a girl twin okay in high school so they're gonna be a big part of it so i'm very curious to see like who like how it's gonna work with like the rest of the cast who's also still there it looks like like christopher eccleston like comes to texas yeah they shed a lot of people though yeah um but like people are still gonna like appear yeah um i don't know it looks really great but right now they started uh advertising for it um all over new york and so it gives me great joy to see carrie coon you know on the poster like that then elevated to such status and i love that and similarly to what i find so interesting about like fear the walking dead uh this show because of this thing happened like it's all about like the humans and and the drama so like they moved to this town and and like shit gonna go down like i think there's gonna be some kind of new rapture happening there okay because these people moved in and like you know in fact this town with their whatever i don't know so i think it's just so much potential for like incredible drama and i'm excited me too me too uh so watch that show what else um well we can talk about uh manhattan another amazing program that i think we mentioned before wjn's manhattan season two starts october 13th and what is manhattan manhattan is a a period show in the 40s about the creation of the atomic bomb the manhattan project yes not manhattan yeah it's not manhattan it's the project um and it also has an incredible cast and really great writing and just pays attention to a lot of things that i think other shows don't and i don't know if this show was on any other network yeah i think it would be nominated for lots of things yeah but it is on weird wgn america at least it won it won best titles yeah um which is really good the titles are great the same company did what did they do mad man i thought you said they did outlander oh i'm not sure previously you said that oh really that might not be true well it makes sense for madman because it's not madman for sure yeah because they're both like kind of animated like they're not real people i think they're like in the in the titles i don't need to talk about the outlander credit please don't like no um i could make those credits yeah well i think that they did like i think that yeah because the people that were submitted were like ron and all right yeah anyway um so did the leftovers get nominated i don't know they have maybe should have if not yeah i mean that's definitely worthy of a nomination if anything i forget i looked up this this production i love the title design me every year it's so incredible it's just such a great idea i mean obviously like that's work so it should be recognized absolutely so it is i i dig shows that have titles and it's a bummer that there are so many that just don't now i want to talk about titles that should be like a whole thing yeah um what are your favorite titles of all time i'll tell you mine gosh mine are true blood forever and always uh true blood is really good um there's so many strong contenders i absolutely love the vikings titles uh for many reasons but just kind of like watching the behind the scenes on how they did them i love their thought process obviously like game of thrones hello good ones like oh let's save this we could do a whole thing on this i'm writing it down titles cool you heard it now so manhattan is awesome yeah i if you love to see a show like amc it really should be on amc but if you want to see a series that has it's about dude scientists and one lady scientist who wears a really great pants that's good 40s pants yeah uh like do science things and then also like their wives do kind of being kept in the dark and like but also it has great like i mentioned women writing it has secret lesbians yep and season two says has nev campbell yep who seems to be going around doing a lot of shows she's also on something else and i can't remember what it is me neither but she's there look it up yeah uh you talk about something i'll look it up and i'll go back to you um let's talk about how i am super excited about ash versus evil dead yeah so i'm going to talk about ash versus evil dead and i'm going to talk about ash versus evil dead and i'm going to talk about ash versus evil dead is um exactly what it sounds like it is a show based on the evil dead movies with bruce campbell groovy bruce um and the ramies etc involved and it's on stars uh starts on halloween sorry i keep clicking my pen and i will stop doing that um uh and it's like it's a half hour it looks super super fun it looks like right in the vein of those movies if i feel like if you love those movies you're probably gonna love this show and lucy lawless is there yeah trailer looks really funny and i'm really just excited and i'm gonna i'm gonna actually get stars now so i'm that's definitely the reason why she's getting stars it is but i'm getting it i was gonna i'm gonna get it earlier because of ash i'm getting it earlier than than atlanta i'm gonna get it now because they also have um flesh and bone which looks good yeah i'm getting it earlier than than atlanta i'm gonna get it now and i think you had that written down i have i'm like maybe this is something we should watch you know like i really don't like ballet like it just it makes me crazy flesh and bone is um it says it's a limited series so i don't know if it's like i don't know if it's gonna have like another season or not oh okay like it has a great trailer very like kind of black swan-esque um about the ballet world with i don't know his name because we just call him scars of justice from lawn over uk um he's also adam on house of cards and he's like i don't know his name because he's like i don't know okay also house of cards is what nev campbell is on next yes there you go okay yeah and uh it looks it looks good it looks kind of intense you know you got the like those black swan-esque like horrific shots of like ballet because ballet is the worst it's really terrible i just yeah i don't know why oh so that looks good and i think that like that goes along with my whole thing about how i like i need all the shows on stars are good so hopefully that ash is good and i'm gonna be able to do that in the future i'm gonna be able to do that in the future yeah i was gonna say back to ash where i i mean yeah those movies are great but they're like not my faves i have a problem with like horror comedy as we talked about this yeah mine is more like the i don't know there's like a difference for me with these ones versus like just the like really dumb gross out ones i guess i don't know well what really sold like i watched the trailer for ash versus the evil dead and i was like really like i was sold on it like i was sold on it like and of course it helps when there's lucy lawless all right it really helps me anything helps yeah exactly she helps anything is what you're trying to say but um so i was just like really like immediately kind of like yeah i'm there i'm gonna watch this so that's exciting cool what oh you should talk about man in the high castle um um yes i should did you not want to talk about that yet um you seem hesitant i guess i had i had supergirl right now okay well wait if we're gonna do that jump to that then let's talk about both jessica jones and supergirl okay because both of those are fun like superhero-esque but well jessica jones is not yeah quite but like in the the realms of like superhero uh film and tv but with female leads right but one is on cbs one and one is on netflix so i wonder which one's gonna be better i want one she wears a skirt you have trouble and one she's probably gonna have weird interactions with david tenet that's true so i wonder which one is gonna be better so he's playing mr purple who is a creepster right and but he's not purple he's not he just wears purple so that's good um because it'd be weird if he actually was purple probably yeah um so supergirl is on cbs and i it's probably gonna be in that cbs they're gonna probably make it be like procedurally at some some way you know what i mean like there's gonna be like a thing in episode somehow i don't know it the the preview for it though was so cute it was lovely so cute yeah it had a good vibe it had sister feels all over it like yes um her sister is um lexi gray gray um syler is that her name kyler lee um and anyway i'm a sucker for for sister feels and so i mean it would be nice if there was a successful um television show with a female superhero lead i still don't like her costume she does work for a magazine yeah it's the black widow uh romantic comedy from snl literally what it is like that happened that with the week and then like two a day later they showed this trailer and everyone was like holy shit yeah i can't believe this is real because she works for a um like a magazine that's what the joke is yeah um so yeah but she seems like a genuinely like sweet person and i there's that amazing paparazzi photo that i like absolutely loved which was uh the actress in her supergirl costume on a windy day walking her dog on set and it was just so iconic unless that's on the show and she is actually doing this could be that i would also take that but either way that was just like a lovely image and then so yeah so i mean jessica jones netflix trailer november 20th another trailer came out did you see it where she like hits the alarm clock breaks the alarm clock one relates um so and i love kristen ritter uh i guess i don't know her really well you don't i think she's cool i didn't watch that show she was on the trust the b yeah i mean she was cute on that she's good on breaking bad oh yeah i did not watch that parts of breaking bad with her in it except for you know the thing um no i haven't seen that actually either so so yeah so that i hope those are both successful i would like successful super super ladies um she's not super but you know what i mean you know what since we talked about breaking bad for two seconds she is super i don't know the fact story the fact the fact about flesh and bone is that it's from the the writer lady writer who did the azim india's episode oh the one of the best hours of tv yeah she's a creative that's great okay cool anyway jessica jones i'm excited about i really hope it goes to the dark places that it sounds like it should excellent especially because it's on netflix yeah netflix can make it go wherever like that and make it be better than daredevil yeah oh gosh it doesn't have far to go to be better than daredevil though i know gosh well according to that uh article from the verge where they tell exactly when people get hooked on stuff on netflix daredevil was like episode like five or six and we did not get that far at all because it was like the worst all right sometimes you don't have that much time there are 400 plus scriptures on after all anyway well the man in high castle also premiered the same day or yeah the same day as jessica jones and i mentioned it before and i'll mention it again it's from frank spotnitz and it's on amazon and it is based on philip k dick's book the man in high castle and it's about an alternative history where germany and japan won the war and half of well most of america technically it was germany's according to this and then uh the east so new york the east coast is german and the west coast is occupied by japan and it's about people dealing with that and resisting and it seems to be adapted like way differently than the book which i previously ranted about and right you did there you go so yeah that seems like a cool show yeah cool creatives cool concept um so i want i definitely filmed in vancouver yeah i feel like that's like all the like big stuff like yeah i don't have anything else i wrote down okay so like i'm not really interested in watching fargo but i kind of am just because kirsten dunst is on it i just want to hear her doing yes the minnesota accent yeah that dropped a gorgeous accent a l a alaska a l e um so i mean i know people really like that show and i didn't watch the first season yeah just like i don't know so like sometimes somewhere i have to draw a line with the amount of tv that i watch the the problem is that i wish that we could just all right so the second season of fargo is really a prequel to the first season of fargo so we could technically watch it but we understand some stuff some stuff the thing is though that it has like its cast is like so much yeah that i'm like oh it would be like a slog to like look at billy bob thornton and like martin freeman and like i don't even know who else is in that first season that i don't don't care like the cast is not enticing to me season two cast i mean obviously leading over the fact that i really love kirsten dunst and i want her to be back in things and doing movies and whatever she's really great at acting and i'm very happy that she's back with this and i'm very happy that she's back with this again her skill of doing that accent but so i'm like i would rather watch this yeah um so yeah it sucks that we have to kind of do the first one before we do this one and then we just watch that trailer for something on sci-fi channel yeah it's like a weird space thing there's a space thing on sci-fi channel and it stars yeah and jared harris and others and like it i'm always kind of semi at all times of stuff on sci-fi because i just don't know if it's gonna be like cheesy cheap or like really good i don't think this is cheesy cheap but it had that scene of people having sex like while floating in zero gravity and i immediately rolled my eyes just like nope but well that sounds cool to me but like anyway like that's a cheap trick man like defiance is so good that i just like don't want them to do other shows i just want them to like keep that show on and they won't um but you know this was like you know one of those things with like if you like battle star galactica and like the like more hardcore sci-fi that was on when the sci-fi channel was still called the sci-fi channel like you might like this so it's like all right um i give that a shot like depending i don't know it's so annoying because that's literally what you say about defiance like it's like i know if you like battle star galactica why don't you watch this show literally created by people who made battle star galactica that is Like an adult program and it's sci-fi based entirely. It is like a fucking rated R show. Yeah. Technically speaking. Yeah. It did so much stuff. Anyway. So that was all I had. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. What's your. If you are excited about other stuff, you can let us know. Yeah. Because there are, again, hundreds of shows. Yeah. And we cannot talk about all of them. And we don't care about all of them either. Yeah. We don't care about lots of them, guys. Just FYI. Anything on network, we don't care about. For the most part. So. Yeah. So, yeah. What. There was a really weird show on CBS that kept popping up. Again, I'm like, oh, CBS. No. But it stars Jane Lynch. And she's like a crazy lady who thinks she's kind of like an angel. Okay. That sounds like a fun concept. And she like. I don't know. I guess. It's like a buddy comedy where she like hooks up with this like lady who's a dermatologist. Okay. And I don't. It's like, is she really an angel or is she a crazy lady? Okay. And she seems like she could be either one because she's like a trashy kind of person. She has like a flask. Okay. She's like a drinker. Uh-huh. That seemed funny. I don't know what it's called. Okay. But it's on CBS. Sounds fun. It's like a fun premise. Yeah. Is that it? I think so. I think that was our preview. Okay. And obviously if stuff starts popping up that like we didn't mention, we'll definitely like bring it up. Yeah. Going forward. But again, like for us, the fall season is not as crazy as the spring. No. And, um, but at least like there's a lot of fun like horror on like we got American Horror Story. Yeah. Fear of the Walking Dead. It's almost over. It's not really horror, but like, you know, it's got its elements and then Ash versus Evil Dead. So that's all exciting to me going into October. Yeah. The best month of all the months. Yeah. And it's going to be great. So. Cool. Yeah.",
