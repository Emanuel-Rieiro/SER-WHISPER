    "text": " good god okay well i don't know how you want to begin here i mean obviously we need to talk about last night's debate you watched it live i didn't watch it live i watched social media reaction which is the basically worst thing to do well it depends on what you're looking for sure if you're looking for what happened that night if you're trying to get the temperature in the room yes social media is the last thing you want to go to to find that out because what you basically have is millions of partisans telling you why their person's winning and why the other person sucks correct but what i was able to get out of it from a social media perspective because i've got a trained eye tracy as you know which one the left or the right haven't decided yet they're both shimmying um it appears to me from social media reaction that trump had a strong 30 minutes at the beginning and then started to trail off and then at that point uh because she wasn't fading she had already faded and there's such a low bar for her she was consistently low and from what i've been able to tell from at least the social media side trump's performance kept declining um as the debate went on until maybe the last 10-15 minutes you watched the debate what did you see well i agree with that assessment overall i just have to add in that it got dreadfully boring in the middle and i don't know if that's why he kind of faded back or not but i think that bodes well for him because it speaks to her he's any debate that he's been in previous to this has never gotten what i would call boring and this was just like oh my god are we really going here and it was also a question issue as well because of course we had to waste i don't even know how much time five minutes maybe talking about the birth certificate crap yet again yes um really like this is what people are dying to hear about when we see these two on stage to fight about this issue that should be long dead but they can't let it go and then there was another issue that she wanted to bring up you know his tax returns we got to talk about his tax returns for another five or six minutes well and then there was also i don't know if she brought it up or if it was a question from lester holt regarding a lawsuit back in the 70s yes so that's what we're doing now we can go back into the 70s for donald trump we can't discuss hillary's law career no that's completely off limits we're not going to talk about the time she defended and uh successfully got off a child rapist with two months in prison and laughed about it and there's audio of this no he says i've read about this before and it was right when he came into his father's company that there was a massive and he says it was a basically a class action lawsuit against a whole bunch of real estate developers and and uh apartment building owners and such like this that was a civil rights class action suit brought against them so he pointed that part out which i've never heard it's always been presented as this was just trump and his daddy they were targeted because they weren't renting to blacks tenants etc etc and he's been presented as this and he says no it was a giant lawsuit there were a bunch of people sued we settled and we admitted no guilt because we didn't do anything wrong so to me i think that puts it to bed for the vast majority of people but this is the desperation that the levels that we've reached right now because i think the black vote is slipping away from her yeah and deservedly so and he did manage to slam in there the super predator line i'm sure lester holt followed up on that right oh of course hillary all about that and remember lester holt is registered republican oh yes and it's just such an incredible joke oh totally totally totally but i wanted to go over my uh first impressions with you just looks wise because that's how shallow i am okay and i'm going to provide some anecdotal evidence for you so trump looked not in the least bit orange oh which is really good for him i have a you know i have a lot of friends that are in the uh entertainment business one of whom is a makeup artist and she's not a trump fan but she had posted on facebook you know finally trump let somebody do his makeup that knows what they're doing and he looks semi-human tonight so i'll take that as a win and i thought it was interesting he chose to wear a light blue tie and he has been known to wear kind of not political politically safe colors if you will he's worn orange and pinks and stuff like that so i thought it was interesting he went with blue which is you know the color of democrats somehow that change came about in the 80s and we've just gone with it yes and um and he had a american flag lapel pin and she chose she looked great i have to say that her makeup was flawless her hair looked wonderful and she chose to wear a red mouse suit which is the color of republicans and i did not see a flag pin in evidence of course not which is just bizarre because if you'll remember obama got hounded over that but it's okay for her you can't hound her because that would be sexist but in her defense for her crowd there's a lot of people who are going to be like oh my god i'm not going to be like that i'm not going to be like that i'm going to be like that i'm going to be like that i'm not going to be like that i'm not going to be like that an american flag lapel pin can be triggering of course and they posted a sign to warn people this was on a college campus it was at hofstra university that things that are said in that room could trigger people and they actually provided two phone numbers for people who got triggered if you have those um no i don't why do you want to call them yeah call them right now yeah maybe we'll do that later on today one of the things that i found fascinating about the whole thing was there were a few times during the debate where hillary would yell out fact checkers yes and anyone else doing that you would think to yourself my goodness this person wants to be president of the united states and she's yelling for the hall monitor you cannot as president of the united states be sitting at a table in front of vladimir putin and the putin says something that you don't agree with or you don't think is factually accurate you can't just yell fact checker in the middle of the meeting because he'll give you the stink eye you want to be president and yet she's going to be able to get away with that asives And maybe that will play in America. I don't know. I mean, and just she also pointed out, and I'm not sure if you saw this clip, that they had already set up her campaign website to be doing fact checking. So they have this all preloaded and tweetable and shareable and all this stuff. So it's Hillary Clinton dot com backslash literally Trump. And I checked it out today and it was obvious that this was all predetermined because some of them didn't really come up. But I thought this was this might be my favorite. The fact that they have to fact check this. Trump says what Trump likes to say that Hillary Clinton is the founder of ISIS. She's not. And then parenthetically, neither is Barack Obama. And he did say she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life, which I believe the AP fact checked and said, no, actually. I mean, does anybody take that stuff? Literally. Talking heads, partisans. But right there, normal people don't know. People understand that. Right. To me. Here's the deal. This debate was about one thing and one thing only. Is Donald Trump someone people can trust to be president of the United States? Mm hmm. We know from 2012. Who won the first debate in 2012? Mitt Romney. He cleaned Barack Obama's clock. Yep. And what happened? Are we talking about President Romney today? Nope. So, look, I don't think from what I've been able to tell, you know, from social media reactions, some of the clips I saw that this was not Trump. I think he was a little bit wary about how to handle this, to be overly mean and smack her around like he did with the Republican field during the primary or to kind of play it nice. And I think he went for playing it nice. He didn't call her a single name last night. And she called him tons of names. Yeah. Which is this is a new look for him. But during that first segment, that first 30 minutes, fingers, he I lived vicariously through him. He was just standing up on that stage. I'm not kidding you. How many times have we wanted to confront a politician and just say, look, he said to her, where did I write? I wrote all this stuff down because I was like, this is just friggin brilliant. You've been here, you know, basically for 30 years. What have you done? Why are you just coming up with solutions now? This is, you know, this is ridiculous. And everybody can understand that. Right. Why are we sending her back there again? She's been there forever. And if you have these solutions. Why are you just coming up with them now? And she kind of had to backpedal and say, well, I've had them for a long time. OK, well, then you suck at leader leading people because you haven't gotten any of them implemented. There's only so long and so many times you can blame someone else for your failures and have people nod politely and say, yep, I agree. You can only say. And, you know, I and I did see some of this on social media from people who. Claim to be independents. My gosh, so much of this is the old playbook. I'm going to raise, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy. You know, we're going to provide all this free stuff. My opponent's racist. It's all out of the same Democratic playbook that it's been played for so long. That people are looking for change. And if you go back to the 2008 election, you had a wet behind the ears. Back bencher of a senator from Illinois going up against a 95 year old man who had been in Washington forever. All Barack Obama had to do was prove that he could be president of the United States. People want to change. Next thing you know, Barack Obama's president of the United States. Uh huh. And all Trump had to do was prove that he's not a crazy person. Yes. And according to Scott Adams, who's been following. This and talking about Trump's ability to be massively persuasive. That's all he had to do. And he succeeded at that. But it's clear that. People still are not happy with who they're choosing between them in this election. And you could tell that. You know, it wasn't just the talking heads. I talked to people who are into politics. And. That are just, you know, the kind of people that will go every four years and vote. And. For the few people that I talked to that are like that, it was a hard debate to watch. OK. Because Hillary isn't likable. Mm hmm. The media has painted a picture of Donald Trump and he's helped. Paint the picture as well that, you know, at times he's not likable. And his unfavorable. Unfavorability numbers. You know, prove that. So. You've got two unlikable people. Who really aren't all that good at debating. Standing up there for 90 minutes without a break. And then you've got Lester Holt, who. Really, from what I've been able to see through reaction. And post debate analysis didn't do the best job in the world. And at the beginning, I was actually seeing people singing his praises that he was just letting him go at it. Yeah, the beginning was great. He just let them. Right. But then when you start, you know, you're asking questions about lawsuits from the 70s and. First certificates that no one gives a shit about anymore. Talking about he allowed her to go into the whole Donald Trump is called women pigs. And and I just laugh hysterically at this because I don't think this is effective. I watch reality television. Women call each other pigs all the time. I mean, this is the culture that we live in. Yeah. So and he said some one of them. Nice U.S. Whatever his beauty pageant was, one of them got a little chubby. So he called her Miss Piggy. And I'm supposed to be personally offended by this. I don't think so. You saw. No. What was the ad that you made a great parody of the mirror? Yeah, we'll be coming out either today or tomorrow. It was all. You have to stop yourself from laughing if you have a sick sense of humor like I do. And you enjoy personal insults. But it's a bunch of young women of all ethnicities. And ages and sizes looking at themselves in the mirror. And over top of that, they've got Trump saying something. I think the first line he says is, look at that fat face. And this is when I spit my coffee out of my mouth because I was laughing so hard. And it's all we can't let our daughters grow up with a president like this or something as if she's a better alternative. As if she's a woman to aspire to be like she's a maniacal lying. Right. Allogist. Yes. Yes. And I don't know if you saw it, but one of the most telling images to me from last night, there's a shot of Bill and Chelsea in the audience. They don't look too thrilled. They're not sitting there elated like, oh, Hillary's kicking butt. They look really, really down. I'm telling you. And people argue with me about this. I don't think Bill Clinton wants anything to do with being in that house again. Well, he's been able to do what he's wanted. Right. She's been out of the house. She went to 120 countries fingers. That makes her qualified. Her passport has more stamps than anybody on the planet. And I mean, it's so hard because talk about fact checking. She comes out there and says, you know, the 2008 crisis. Do you know what caused that fingers? Well, I well, it has to be Bush, right? Tax cuts. Oh, tax cuts. Yes. Amazing. Tax cuts. And that's what led to the housing market collapse. How these two things are interrelated, I have no clue. And she didn't bother to explain it because she's just counting on the fact that people are so angry about the rich that they'll just believe that. And then she pinged Trump for saying she's like he rooted this on the housing bubble collapse. And she points to something he says in 2006. So to me, I'm like, oh, huh. So he predicted that that was coming. And yet you who were sitting in the Senate didn't get it. Didn't move. Didn't do anything about it. Not that I think that there should be government intervention because I think it caused it in the first place. But they also people understand that Trump's not buying up people's homes. Right. He's not. He's a Warren. No, of course. That'll never get discussed. But it's just mind numbingly stupid to me. And he did manage to get in there. I thought he was going to say he was going to end the Fed. I'm sitting there being like, say it, say it, say it, because he said, I just want to point out we're in a bubble again. And it's going to be bad. It's going to be disastrous. And the Fed is completely politicized. And that needs to stop. And if they raise interest rates, the only thing that's doing right well is the stock market. And as soon as they raise interest rates, it's all over. Yeah. Like, oh, OK, so he has a better grasp on at least my school of economics, which I believe has more ties to reality than Mrs. Clinton's. And oh, the the the tax cuts on the rich cause the housing market collapse. Nothing to do with Franklin Raines over at. Oh, the. Lincoln's essayer. Every once in a while with both\u0dab Steve SCP going over the wall and wants to stop the takim printing department, the THE QUEEN. Kr tenha Luca McClellan and Ryan Jones. As such, this? The timing seems to be viewed from the Republican mentoring table roadside by Russia's race, rather than the coalition known as president. Clinton? is bad for the country and could actually, in this case, cause a housing collapse. Yes. It has nothing to do with Fed policy or policies coming out of Washington. Nothing created the circumstances for that, aside from letting rich people keep more of their own money. Somehow that ended up with people that couldn't afford to pay their mortgages getting mortgages in the first place. Right. You had people making $15 an hour, getting $300,000 mortgages. Tell me how that has anything to do with tax policy. And actually, if you look at it, the prime market soured first. And this is something that I learned in Tom Woods's book Meltdown. He said, if you want to actually look at this, cause he's an, he comes out of the Austrian school of economics that always looks at Fed policy and money supply and stuff like this and interest rates and how that affects everything. So their stance on all of this is because the Fed kept interest rates low, what are rich people going to do? Are they going to put their money in the bank and earn basically 0% interest on it? Are they going to invest in something? Exactly. So they started investing in real estate too and flipping it like crazy. And then that market dried up first. So it wasn't just, oh, all this is on the way to the poor who through government policies and pressures, we forced banks to give loans to, and then we backed them. They were packaged and sold. So they were sold by Freddie, uh, Fannie and Freddie with the full weight and credit of the United States government behind every single one of those loans. So they were loans that could not fail. They got triple a ratings from the bond rating agencies. Give me a break. You're going to tell me this is because Donald Trump hasn't paid taxes, which he's now saying flat out. This is why you're not releasing your tax returns either. It's because you don't make as much money as you say you do, or you don't pay any taxes.",
