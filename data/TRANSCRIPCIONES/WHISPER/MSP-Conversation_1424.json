    "text": " I'm going to be talking with Panashi Chigumadze after an article that came out on smart women being hot babes. And I asked the question, why does it still hurt smart women to be seen as hot? I thought this was something that was cured. Here's a whole lot of really young South African women talking about how they had to, if you like, not consider what it meant to be serious, to try and look older to be serious. And I thought that was quite sad that we weren't able to be real. Jackie via Facebook says, great. She says, I'm a hot babe, Lindsay. I have a malfunctioning hermitage and I shop at pep stores. No chance of someone wearing the same outfit as me. No chance of someone's even setting foot in pep stores. She says, I'm serious. Not a chance. So she's taking a bit of humor. In terms of on smart women being hot babes. And I suppose there's always a pressure if you're smart and if you're gorgeous, that people, if you're gorgeous, will think that you are a fifi and not take you very serious, which is certainly something that is frustrating for women who are trying to make a place in South Africa. This sense. Of having to dumb down and. Act pretty rather than smart and almost as if people spend more time on the image and the issue of surgeries and diets than looking at at the power of what it means to be smart. You know, we hear about young people pretending not to be clever so that they're not singled out. I was saddened that still it's. I was saddened that still it's. I was saddened that still it's. I was saddened that still it's. And there's some young woman feeling this pressure. So my question also is, where does the pressure come from? You know, if if there if there is pressure to look serious, where does it come from? Who puts the pressure on us? And at what point do we we buy into that that pressure? So this article was by Simon Keller. Like, like, I listen to me. I'm getting stuck at like. But. The person I'm going to be talking to this morning, her name is Panashi. She comes from Ilova and she is the. The editor and founder of Vanguard magazine, and she was interviewed as part of this interview. She was one of several women interviewed as part of the interview by Simon Keller. And on the issue of smart. Women being hot babes. Panashi, hi. Good morning to you. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for being on air. The bit you might not have heard because you were on with Amy that I was talking about is how sad I was that here are all young women feeling still a pressure to try and look serious. Of course. I mean, we still live in a patriarchal society, so we are not going to be shielded from that. So as long as you know, those relations haven't changed. There's no. I think it makes sense that we will continue to fight or have to fight that kind of battle. And that will be the case for our daughters and our granddaughters until, you know, we've ridded ourselves of, you know, that form of patriarchy that also has a very racial term as well. You know, in the article you said that, you know, that that, you know, you felt that there was this pressure to look serious and have this polished look and you and you said it's not a neutral thing. No, of course not. So often, you know, for example, we speak about having a polished look and you know, that you shouldn't have an exotic look. And often by exotic, it means, you know, no efforts, you know, and the likes here, no dreadlocks, you know, that kind of thing is going to be sanctioned. So it means that, you know, in order for my head to look polished, it means often that my hair must be relaxed. And you also see this in schools as well, where you'll find in school codes of conduct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That they will say, you know, no exotic hairstyle such as afro, which is, you know, natural hair, exactly as it comes out of my head. So it's definitely not neutral because, you know, it excludes many black women in particular based on, you know, what is natural to us. I suppose, you know, I sense a frustration. I remember many years ago, I was doing a training and the lady who was coming to assess the whole process, assess the person who was doing the training, had a good chat with me. And she says, I wished I could be as free as you were in terms of your look. And she says, I wished I could wear dreadlocks at the Department of Labor. And I was, I was floored. And I said, why can't you? You know, and I realized that part of that was probably where I came from my white middle class privilege, where I never had a sense of, it was okay for me to be smart and look, however I wanted, because I never needed to prove anything, if you like. Exactly. I mean, even if it's not something that is in a code of conduct, you know, that it explicitly says, do not have this kind of look, it's definitely not something that is generally looked upon with any sort of positive sense. Generally, you know, it's the kind of thing that maybe someone who, you know, has some sort of empathy for you. And your career might pull you aside and say, you know, maybe you might want to change your hairstyle. And it definitely is coming from, it is a privilege to be able to be who you are, because, you know, and it goes through just generally what particularly the experience of black people, black women in corporate South Africa is having to constantly prove yourself. And part of that proving yourself is an alienation of self. So definitely, there's very much a patriarchal and a racial tone to. And I think that's a very important thing that we're all going to have to do, whether it's in the workplace or, you know, in the workplace, to show up in the workplace. But now I've got an important question for you. The workplace is not, is changing. And oftentimes, yes, I understand the context in which you are, but the shape and size of corporate places is changing. My question is, where does that come, where does the pressure come from? And who is pushing the, putting the pressure there? And how much are women? And to blame, you know, when you're called aside, is it a woman who's calling you aside? In other words, is it not our perception of what is okay? In other words, I have a concern when I see a department that, for example, is women and it's still happening. That I don't get. You know, I really hate to victim blame. Okay. At the end of the day, it is even if, you know, first of all, patriarchy. It doesn't need women to, or it doesn't need men to perpetuate. It's racism or rather white supremacy doesn't need white people to perpetuate it, right? Because, you know, if this is, those are the constraints with which you work. And these people have learned that this is the best way in which you can survive. And honestly, it actually can be seen as someone doing you a favor because they've understood that these are the rules. These are the ways in which you can survive corporate better. Yeah. And they're willing to work for you. And they're willing to work for me to help you by doing what it is that will help you succeed within that. So if you don't deconstruct that system, it doesn't matter whether it's women or men or black people, white people doing it at the end of the day, it still serves the same system. So it's not surprising that women will do that because they bear the brunt of it. So women can be just as patriarchal. Black people can be just as white supremacists because they've learned the ways in which or the codes for which you need to succeed in the current social democracy. Yeah. And I think that's what's happening in the current socioeconomic system in South Africa. But, you know, before I was talking to you, I was I was talking about the issue of aren't we the ones, you know, we can always blame other people and blame the government. But, you know, we are the government. And in this case, can it not change by the people? Can the people not in the system change it? I mean, I was shocked. I mean, I understand in a corporate environment, but I was shocked in the article when Chimamanda Arichi says, you know, as a 26 year old, she she hid her high heels. But it's not surprising. It wasn't in a corporate setting. She was she was an author and she felt she felt that she wanted to be taken seriously as an author. And so she hid her high heels. She she felt that orange, which happened to flatter her, her skin tone was too loud. Her earrings were too low. I mean, that that, you know, everything she felt she should wear was uninteresting, too bright, too fitted and too unusual. And that for me is shocking. And it almost seems to me that women have to be successful in order to say, no, this is this is this is this is ridiculous. Not what I have to do. Yeah. Look, again, it's not it doesn't come out of nowhere. I mean, it was funny because just before I was preparing for this interview, my boyfriend decided to just quickly Google the article. And this mom Gilly wrote and, you know, smart women, hot babes and what came out of it was a whole range of very sexist articles. About the. About hot, smart women or, you know, ranking the hottest smart woman and all kinds of things. And you see so many times when a woman who has a role that has nothing to do with her looks is completely shamed for the way in which she dresses with. It's been your Hillary Clinton or Jim Marcus. This happens all the time. So it's not surprising. It's responding to the social cues that are out there that, you know, if you look a certain way, you know, it must be. You know, mutually exclusive that, you know, beauty and brains don't go together. We always hear that or see that. And it it is unfortunate that it does take some level of success or having no less of a sense of wanting to prove yourself. You know, for example, and I say this in the article that when I first started out in corporate South Africa, I had to do very much of the growing up in terms of my look and that to my mind, I did, particularly being a young black woman. I had to do so much more to ensure that people took me seriously and the way in which I looked wasn't a factor in what I did. So it's responding to very real conditions. I think I understand what you're saying in terms of saying we need to have a sense of agency. So I think the importance is understanding what are the constraints that you work within. And once we do have some power in some sense, how do we use that to change the way in which we do things? Yes. Yes. Yes. So if we all engage in our own practices that would be say that look, this is not how we're going to do this here so that they are alternatives for the young black women, for other women who are working and saying that this is different. And as well, you know, for example, doing work some is doing advocating and speaking out against some of the pressures that a lot of us do feel. For me it's a disappointment when i'm, you know, you young, you're vibrant, you're 26 and by looking at your photograph, you're gorgeous. Saw uh.6 For me, it's appalling that you should feel that there's some pressure too. in \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434istan. Thank you for this introduction to South Africa. to have this so-called Anglo-Saxon polished look. You know, and what I'm getting from the articles, a lot of people are saying, actually, now I've realized I can be sexy. As I'm just trying to find her first name, Baola. Danielle says, you know, I'm going to rise and look fresh. You know, I love that quote. You know, her idea that you actually needed a blazer to package yourself. And she said, well, you know, you can actually have an intellectual idea in a crop top. And I suppose there are enough women who have been successful, who should be able to have the maturity to be successful and say, live in your skin, be in your skin. Dreadlocks can be polished. You know, have that afro and walk it with style and intellect. And can we not use as much? You know, can we not work on our mind as much as we work on a surgery to have our boobs bigger and a diet in order to be some mold of something which is long gone and unattainable? Definitely. I mean, look, but again, even if it is to say that there are enough successful women, how many women own or are on the seats of JSC-listed companies, right, or on the boards of those companies? It's less than 10% of JSC-listed companies. You have women who are leading those companies. How many black people own the JSCs or companies on the JSC as well? It's less than 10%. Well, that's a disputed number with what Jacob Zuma says versus what the JSC says. But again, it's who gets to set the tone there. And until that actually changes, there's a lot that needs to still be done. You'll find that, I mean, I actually have an accounting background, so the very corporate space is what I understand more so than the creative, the space that myself, Danielle, and Samamkele, and Nova are speaking about in the article. And there, there's a far less tolerance of the kind of things that we're talking about here. The creative space is obviously one that's a lot freer, and you can express yourself a lot more. But the corporate space is one in which there's going to be a lot more pushback. And until you change those ownership structures, until you de-patriarchalize, until you de-racialize those sectors, it will not change very much. It does lie within those of us who do have those options to continue to make those changes and to speak out about these things and practice it as well. But, you know, like many other things in this country, it's not going to change until we make sure that we're not actually living in a non-racist and non-sexist society. And I suppose that's my concern is that these things linger on. These are terms that... People say, well, when are we going to get there? I mean, we are in a transition. I mean, there's no doubt about it. My side, I mean, in terms of where you are, I'm virtually an old toppy, you know. And these are conversations that are not new. And I suppose for me, the fact that you guys are so young and vibrant and clearly smart and well-versed, and you're walking your talk and you're powerful, and that you still have... You still have a sense that there's pushback and there's this pressure. And I'd love to hear from listeners. Do you think, you know, do you think there is a way out of this or do we just accept it and play the game? As you say, it's a corporate game. Or do we live in our skins and say... and live our smartness and our sexiness and our hotness? And our non-sexiness and whatever it is. I mean, the point is... Yes, yes. ...we just be whatever it is that we want to be. Yes, yes. Or are. And I think what you're saying is this surprise that, oh, why is it that this young generation is fighting these battles that we're still fighting? Yeah. It's the same as those who don't understand the young black people were saying roads must fall. It's the same battle that there's a whole lot that hasn't been fixed or hasn't been addressed yet. So it's not surprising at all that we face a lot of these struggles because we haven't yet got into where we need to as a country yet. So that's my two cents to this. So to the response that, you know, why do the young people still have to face a lot of these issues? You know, I work with young people and what I often say to them is, is be the leader you are and be strong in what you are and don't live to other people's agendas. But I also realize that there is a reality. Yeah. And the pushback that you speak of can be often not something that people can put a finger on, but you feel it and it's there. And I wonder how easy it is to miss if it's not directed at you, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. And I suppose that's why I was making the comment I did earlier about myself and where I came from. And perhaps I couldn't see it because I had an automatic privilege that came from where I came from. No, definitely. And I think that, you know, from feminist theory, you get, you know, standpoint theory, which is about mildness. Or centering the most marginalized voices. That's where you can get the most transformative kind of change because that's, you know, it's almost a sense of looking up from the bottom of the ladder. That's where you'll see a lot because, you know, a lot of the blind spots we have from different spheres of privilege, and they're very intersecting, whether it's middle class privileges that we might have or it's racial or gender privileges that we might have. So I think the more we do work to bring in, you know, those different voices so that we can see a lot, because there's a lot I often see as a middle class black woman as well. But if we work a lot more to diversify what we do get to hear and get insights into, I think we can have a lot more perspectives in what we hear and in our media particularly. And a lot of the politics is about hair, isn't it? I mean, you mentioned Afro and having to tame your Afro. I think it's an easy way for people to understand what it is that I, you know, I'm talking about in terms of an Anglo-Saxon look. But it's also in terms of how you do your makeup as well. So are you trying to make yourself look a little bit lighter? You know, there's ways in which you can do your makeup that you can have a little bit more of a sort of Anglo-Saxon look, you know, rosy cheeks and trying to make your features look a little bit more Eurocentric, even in terms of the kind of dress as well. There are looks that are seen as more sort of African looking. And sometimes, I mean, with the very silly word ethnic looking and the kind of clothes that you choose as well. You know, is this an outfit from Zara or an Italian made shoe? You know, all of those kind of things. So hair, of course, is a very visceral one. Something that a lot of us would have known from school, whether, you know, for example, I remember when I did gymnastics as a young child and, you know, they would say, you know, just do your hair this way. Like, you know, it would be time for the competition. And the teachers would tell us, OK, and I don't know if it's country, but I don't know if it's country. I don't know how they said, particularly for the black girls. But they said, you know, you guys must do your hair like Felicia. And Felicia would have had her hair straight up in a bun, a very tight bun that really hurt her hair. And it was relaxed and it was so-called neat. And the white girls could simply just, you know, put up a bun. And those are the ways in which you start learning as a child that these are the ways in which I should show up into the world in order for me to be acceptable, in order for me to win the prize. So I think there's a whole lot of work that we have to do in order to change the spaces that we move in.",
