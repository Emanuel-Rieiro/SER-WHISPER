    "text": " how are you today i'm all right i'm so grateful for you oh i'm grateful for you in general um i'm grateful to you for speaking to me today and yeah i'm i'm just blown away by what you've done on behalf of our gender you know this conversation has been going on for so many years now and well done you for bringing it to the forefront and making people want to take action about it thanks yeah it's interesting because i'm in this space a lot like i don't like a lot of my activism is around a lot of these issues and it just felt like it got to the point where those two things couldn't be separate anymore and that whole thing is like being quite privileged like i knew that i had the support of my team behind me i knew that i was like working on a project to deal with this so if somebody had questions about it i'd be like i'll actually like i am actually practically also implementing something in my professional capacity um and i just thought well somebody has to do it and i still think there'll be more like a lot of the conversations that have happened since have been about like whether people will name names and stuff and i think there are individuals who are starting to feel uh that they want to do that and obviously if they choose to do that then then they can um so i think there's still i think there's going to be more like i think i've opened pandora's box a little bit um but actually there'll be some other people who either anonymously or publicly could come to the forefront and say some stuff because it just takes one person to like knock the first domino and then there's lots of other amazing people who uh have been talking behind the scenes about this stuff um but now hopefully feel like that it's safer for them to do it more publicly which is kind of why i was hoping yeah my complaint was not backed because i was submitting it on behalf of someone anonymously and they said unless that person comes forward we can't take it any further um and at the time i think i just accepted that that's the way the system works but i've since heard that story from multiple different organizations from multiple different people you know unless unless the person who's been harassed abused assaulted comes forward we can't do anything about it um and i just felt really powerless that's appalling yeah because i know of at least three times that that person has been reported about to that organization i complained about and they're not yeah they're not recognizing that their system is allowing individuals to carry on abusing harassing assaulting women and within their workplaces or at their events yeah so they don't recognize that their systems are broken um yeah so it goes back it goes back to what i was saying about believing women as well because it shouldn't take an individual putting themselves out there and harming themselves to for this to be taken seriously um particularly when there are multiple complaints against somebody uh anonymous testimony should be enough and as long as you have a body bringing that forward i don't understand right um and i think it's you're right it's the systems are broken they're not just broken they're patriarchal systems aren't and go back to this again and again the systems are designed to shut us up when this stuff happens and they are designed that way because men have designed them and we can't skirt around that issue um and i don't mean like oh just men drafted x complaints policy i mean even the idea of how a complaints policy should be done and how it should be done and i don't mean like oh just men drafted such bi policy that putting yourself out of that world been treated interface to a rather consequences need being the agre black\ufffd\ufffd or bridal y 81 burn boolran being accused, to share that with strangers is just ridiculous. Yeah, it's shocking. And that's the first stage of the process. Yeah, and it shouldn't be that way. And our institutes and our organisations have a responsibility to do what they can to mitigate that. But it's really hard. I think a lot of people are very focused on the legalities and watching their own backs and covering their own backs. Which I can understand to a certain extent, but I also think there has to be a point where we put our values, as you say, and people and their awful experiences before anything else. When are we going to start doing that? Isn't that what we're supposed to do? For the charity sector. I just, yeah, I think they have a long way to go. And like, I don't know. Firstly, understanding the issue, but then also thinking about what they might need to change to actually make a difference. But they definitely have a role to play. And my concern is that because of experiences like the one you've just mentioned, because of some of the stories that people have come forward with, particularly in the gurus space, it's just a huge barrier. It's a barrier to people reporting in the first place. And then it's obviously a barrier in terms of how seriously women are taken, how much they're believed, and then what happens. And I've had people say to me, I tried to complain, and then this person complained to this person, who's their buddy, this person, and it just got shut down. And that's so important. So I don't know if you know anything about my history. I had to resign from my job because I wasn't allowed to talk about diversity in public anymore. Disgusting is the only word that I have for it. And obviously I don't know the detail, but I don't think you need to know the detail. So I think part of the reason I had problems was because I'm a new generation, a new generation of chief exec. So I have a better understanding of the way communication works nowadays and the way the media works. And I've also worked, I worked at Change.org before I worked at the Small Charities Coalition. So I was just surrounded by activists who believed in their cause more than they believed in a brand name. And if a brand name becomes prohibitive to what they see as their personal mission, then it's not good. It's not going to fuck the brand. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. But so I think part of the thing that fascinates me about you is that you do have an employer behind you and you are educating them as you go along about the way that you as an individual feel like you are entitled to speak at the moment. Because I think historically charities have signed everything off and that's the only way they felt comfortable. You know? Yeah. And I think that's the thing that fascinates me about you is that you have friends who will sign off a case study and what they mean is they will sign off what their beneficiaries are saying about their work to make sure it's 100% in line with everything they want to say. And therefore they cut out the authenticity and the human element of it. So I was at Amnesty International before, so hence very similar to you. Okay. In that I was somewhere obviously surrounded by activism. That means doing it in a way which is more disruptive and more self-organised and less, more often, task force. When you talk about the activism that we're trying to do, I'm desperate to contribute however I can to whatever you're doing in a helpful and supportive way. Yeah. I don't know what conversations are happening and how we can join those up and all that sort of stuff. Sure. I mean, to be honest, what I've been saying to everyone, firstly, I wrote the article. I had no idea whether or not it would take off in the way that it has. So I'm still trying to reconcile that in my own head and also think about what I know about activism and organising and campaigning and trying to take a step back and actually think about it less emotionally and impulsively and think about it in a more strategic way. Another thing I'm really interested in, like, every single day a new conversation happens on Twitter about this issue or a new email address. Yeah. And then it just sort of arrives in my inbox from somebody being like, what about this? What can I do about this? So I kind of want to keep the conversation going, which is what I'm trying to do, but also allow them to play out because I think that's a really important part of this and kind of seeing where it goes, but in a very conscious way. So staying on top of the conversations, at least the ones that happen in the public sphere, and then having my own behind closed doors. So the only kind of tangible next step that I can see is there's a group of people who want to name somebody and they have approached me and said, this is what we want to do. And we're trying to set up a call to talk about who that is, because I don't know yet. I can give you a list of potentials, but I don't know who they're talking about and how we would go about doing that because they want to do it anonymously. I'm not sure how we would do that. But it's not something I'm going to shy away from either. People will be like, oh, it's not helpful to name anybody. They just need to be eradicated from our sector. I don't care if this destroys somebody's career. If they are a predator, then they deserve that to happen to them. That's the end of the conversation for me. So I'm not concerned about that. I'm concerned about the people who are doing the reporting and the people who are doing the naming. That's my primary concern. And also what will that change? Let's say that we do name, for example, the person that you just mentioned. Mm-hmm. If we need to think about, OK, what are we trying to achieve by doing that? Yeah. As long as we're having that part of the conversation. And if the answer to that is he doesn't speak at conferences anymore, we need to really think about the next step because I don't want to blow something up for blowing something up's case. I really not learned my lesson, but I had a really interesting experience. I was heavily involved internally with lobbying senior management to do more because I was chairing the women's group. And I was really involved internally with lobbying senior management to do more. So I think that it got to the point where they just weren't listening or weren't listening or weren't listening. It went on for like nine months or something. And I felt like I was at this crossroads where I was thinking, like, OK, do I leak this to the press or do I take one more go at trying to try and do this in a constructive way? And it was so hard. I remember going home to my boyfriend and being like, how can I possibly do that? But at the same time, like this is getting so beyond a joke, that if that's the only way to force change, then I'll do it anyway. decided to take the second option of like putting it through a constructive way one more time went to the Union did it that way the Union put forward a list of demands and it all seemed like it was actually going to be taken seriously and then the following week somebody else leaked it to the press and nothing's happened since because it completely undermined all of the work and the demands of the Union and of the work that had gone on and undermined the work that had gone on internally so I've seen that not work because that doesn't work in terms of creating change unless you've thought very carefully about what you're hoping to achieve on the other side and so I think we just have to be really aware of that while we're having these conversations about naming and we don't need to approach everything in an ad-hoc way as well because a lot of these people are independent consultants and they're not, you know we can't go to their line manager or their CEO or whatever we need to look at each case and think okay where are the levers that we can pull to hold this person accountable",
