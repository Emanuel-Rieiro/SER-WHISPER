    "text": " Okay, welcome to the final lecture in the Environment, Sustainability and Society Lecture Series for 2016. Of course, there's lots more beginning. In just a few weeks, we'll be back here on the 19th of January for the first of the winter lecture series. I'm Steve Bunnell, Director of the College. Tonight's a really special night for lots of reasons. It's a bit of an unorthodox night. We also have a special group of guests, a scout troop here tonight at the front. So give them all a hand. They're here to learn about what we all want to learn about, which is what are people actually really doing? What do young people actually do about sustainability once they get inspired, once they get educated or maybe miseducated, once they get directed to expend their energies out there in the world? So tonight we're going to find out. I'm happy now to introduce the various people. We have a few of our graduates and students and friends of the College of Sustainability. First, Sarah Aspinall. Sarah. Sarah's from Oakville, Ontario. She's in her fourth year studying environment, sustainability and society in ESS. She's a co-founder and the research and development director of Let's Sprout, which is a group working to facilitate spaces for young girls to increase their authentic leadership capacity and to address environmental and social justice issues. Joanna Brenchley. Joanna's a recent grad from the College of Sustainability in ESS and environmental science as well. She has a keen interest in climate justice, healthy communities and public art. She's currently part of CoLab, where she gets to practice facilitation, conduct interactive research and host meaningful conversations with correct pronunciation, all with the aim to support strategic solutions that meet today's complex challenges. And I think CoLab is out there in the audience, aren't they? Where's CoLab? Give it up for CoLab. Yay! Emma Norton. Emma's a graduate of University of King's College with a combined honours degree in ESS and international development studies. She was awarded the university medal in ESS, the first one. She is motivated by social justice and climate change and strives for a fossil-free electricity grid in Atlantic Canada, where energy is affordable for all. While at Dal, she was the sustainability officer for the student union and sustainability. She successfully started a campaign to help students reduce their carbon emissions by travelling by train instead of plane. At the Ecology Action Centre, she coordinates the Culture of Efficiency project and was also manager of materials and volunteers for EAC's showcase green renovation project last year. This is a special guy. Rob McNeish. Rob's the farm coordinator at Dartmouth North Community Food Centre. He's currently building a 20,000 square foot urban farm and community garden. He has a strong passion for food and has been heavily involved in Halifax's urban gardening movement, revitalizing the student garden at Dalhousie while studying sustainability and international development studies. In addition to being a member of the Common Roots Urban Farm since its inception in 2011. Rob's been a long time volunteer with the Community Forest International and in May he will become an alumnus of the College of Sustainability. He will graduate at last. And we're all so happy about that. Siobhan Tanaka is from Saskatchewan. Come on out. She came to Dalhousie. How about this? She came to Dalhousie without knowing about the College of Sustainability. How could that be? She fell in love with the program after accidentally taking it in first year. Accidentally taking a class. Imagine that. She's now in her third year studying ESS and environmental science. She's currently co-founder and executive director of Let's Sprout. An initiative born out of the sustainability movement. With a sustainability leadership certificate last year. And finally, George Woodhouse. George. George is our host. He's a Dal grad who was introduced to the world of youth engagement as a student through Parks Canada Lens. In 2010, he won a National Parc Canada video contest with his Enviro-wrapped Tales from the Trails about Newfoundland's Gros Morne National Park. Since then he's had the opportunity to write and rap songs about national parks. And sing for people around fake and real campfires. real campfires. He grapples with the question of how our society will be more inspired and well equipped to connect with nature. He likes to play guitar and back in the day he was a floor hockey intramural referee. He's going to need those skills tonight. He's now working with Parks Canada as a program and policy officer in youth engagement. I'm now going to hand it over to George and I don't have to do anything else tonight, which is great. Okay. Brought my own. Oh, we'll go this way. Steve, thank you very much. Was there some music also that was queued up? Did we already play it? Can we play it again just to get in the mood a little bit? All right. Tonight, welcome to, welcome. I just need to see the title slide again. Oh, no. Yeah. Give it up, everybody, for the music. That's right. Perfect. That was an abrupt fade. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Late Night Talking Sustainability. Season one, episode one, season finale as well. We're here to celebrate December. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do we eat? No. Co-in\uac10\uc774? OK. So January, December, it's, it's the first day of the month. And we're here with some of the finest, the finest young people, you know, less young people, and people in general that care about, and I know what you're thinking. This is so, where is he going with this? I don't know. But, we're here tonight for one reason, and that is that we want to learn from each other, and we're all on a journey. journey that involves some care for this planet and we want to do things a little bit better. Blah, blah, blah. Yes, yes, yes. So we have a panel of some of the finest people and also a lot of green in the front row, which is really good to see. Give it up for our guests in green, the scouts. And orange. I saw your sweater. So we're going to be diving right into a panel of experts that were sitting in the very seats that you are sitting in now, not too long ago. So without further ado, let us begin. First on tonight's show, we have Sarah Ashton, the director of Aspenol. Now, before we were getting this concept of the show ready, we said, how are we going to introduce people? And two things you're proud of and one challenge that you've had is how we're going to do that. And I'm going to say it and then pass it over to Sarah. But I realize, Sarah, this is like not set up for conversation really well right now. So I'm just going to wheel around here. Am I going to fit? All right. Pardon me. I got wheels. I can do what I want. All right. Hey. Sarah, doing a little bit of research into your life before tonight, thanks to what you provided me with. You were proud of moving away from your family to come to Halifax. And I can agree with that. But one of the challenges was remembering that small actions can have a big impact. Not always easy to remember because we turn on the news and everything's huge. I feel you. And I think everyone here can agree. But to complete the sandwich of challenge and pride, one other thing you're proud of is founding Let's Sprout. And you've been on quite a journey. Would you mind sharing a few things with us? Yeah, sure. Sure. So for me, when I think about how I got here, I guess it kind of starts in high school, really. I always grew up really caring about environmental and social issues. But I didn't really know how to channel that energy and that passion. And I never really found people to connect with who cared about the same things that I did. And I also had no idea what I wanted to do when I graduated high school. And I kind of accidentally ended up showing up at a presentation that Dalhousie was giving at my high school. And Dal had always been on the back of my mind. I have family from the East Coast. And I spent summers here. I love Halifax. But when I was at this presentation, they were talking a lot about the college, which was something I had never heard about. And I was like, that's cool. That's exactly what I want to learn about. So I applied to Dal and only Dal. Because I was a student at the University of California. And I was like, that's cool. That's exactly what I want to learn about. So I applied to Dal and only Dal. Because I decided that that's all I was going to do. Which, looking back on it, may not have been the smartest decision. But it's fine. It worked out. I'm here. And I got to Dal. And I fell in love with the college from the beginning. I really loved all of my classes. And I was finally learning about the things that I wanted to learn about. But I still felt a really big disconnect between the things I cared about and actually how to make tangible action. And how to change the things that I wanted to change. And I struggled with that a lot. And I ended up signing up for the SLC last year. The Sustainability Leadership Certificate, for those who don't know. And I basically did it because one of my friends was doing it. And I didn't really have many expectations. I just didn't know what it was going to be like. I didn't know what was going to come from it. And it ended up being one of the better choices I've made, for sure. And I connected with Siobhan and some other really awesome ladies. And we got to talking about starting up some type of group or program to help girls feel empowered to take action. And from the second that idea came up in the program, I was like, that's it. That's what I want to do. And it's so important to me. it was something that I always felt like I didn't have and it was something I always really wanted. So I wanted to be able to give other girls the opportunity to explore their interest in the environment and explore the things they cared about and know that they have the capability to make change in whatever way they want to do it. So for me that was a big thing that brought me here.",
