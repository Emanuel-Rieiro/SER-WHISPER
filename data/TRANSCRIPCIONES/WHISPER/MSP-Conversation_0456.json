    "text": " Welcome to the show, Julia. Thanks for having me. So, all right, tell us what exactly is Brave the World? You summed it up pretty well. It's just anything that I find worthwhile exploring and delving into and sometimes standing up in the name of or against. So, I don't know, in the past I've attended CPAC and have asked very anarchistic questions. That was fun. That was one of my first projects. I did the protests at Bilderberg. I've been following the Silk Road case and doing some, I guess, reporting, but more... I don't like to use the word reporting because I think journalists are blood-sucking scum. It's more of a moral support and ethical support in the name of free speech. So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, but I think that's good enough. So, Julia, where does the name Brave the World come from? Does it have an origin that means something to you? Yeah, so everyone knows Brave New World, right? So, instead of a brave new world, instead of embracing a brave new world, we should brave the world and go in the opposite direction. Very cool. And I actually had a question about what you were speaking on a few moments ago. And it had to do with your protesting Bilderberg and also your hatred of journalists because I think that there are awesome journalists and poor journalists like anything else. So, why is it that it took journalists so long to even figure out that Bilderberg is a thing? Because, well, this is the kind of stages of the status quo that we get fed. So, what you have first is complete denial, right? They deny that something's happened completely. Once that becomes harder to do, they label you as conspiracy theorists and say, oh, it's an over-Germanization. Once that becomes apparent that it's not true again, they accept the reality and they accept that we know the reality, but they normalize it. So, Bilderberg, oh, it's no big deal. It's just a meeting. A powerful people and families and politicians and those companies that are in charge of manufacturing arms meeting with potential presidents. No big deal. Oh, and nobody ever really knows when and where and the list is secret and they block off entire public streets and roads, but it's no big deal. Oh, and your taxes pay for it. No big deal. And your taxes also pay. They pay for their security. I believe the Copenhagen one cost over 100,000 euros just for security. And when I was there, I actually bind an endless stream of high protection armored vehicles coming in and out of Bilderberg, the hotel that they were doing it at. So, yeah. That's a years away with their truck based quality as a computer. Yeah. It's exactly where I have been over the years being able to do all the remote testing and Democratic intelligence, and to be a part of\u1ec3u of the ?! Of ? I try to log in on the mobile... Oh, definitely not this year, I'm sorry man Sorry, Chris. You want to log in again. Journalism used to be a profession where it was okay to have a bias and an opinion. It was in fact encouraged. Now to have a bias or an opinion is wrong. That's bad journalism. But the very fact that we deny that there's always a bias and then there's always an opinion when a journalist writes is more dishonest than having an outright bias. So when you have something like a very obvious conflict and you give both sides of the story even though one is obviously in the wrong, I think that's morally reprehensible and I think that it's dishonest because you're giving the same weight to something that might not deserve the same weight. So the entire concept of journalism has been bastardized to me and I hate when I'm called a journalist. And even though I'm a journalist, I'm not a journalist. Even the journalists that are independent and in the libertarian and anarchist communities, I've learned to disrespect a lot of them as well because I've personally experienced some very dishonest activity. So that's really interesting. There's behind, let's say, the Bilderbergs, right? There's like this core philosophy that it seems like you sort of centered a lot of your work around. Could you describe for our listeners sort of what is it about... You know, bad actors in journalism, bad actors at the Bilderberg system that you're really getting at here philosophically? Well, I understand having a kind of motivational factor of gain, right? But it's become so... It's become the sole purpose of people being a journalist. So you get even people that are supposed to be morally honest. And doing good, like people in the libertarian movement, that that is the standard they claim to be on. You know, non-aggression, you know. They're not not profit. But I keep seeing people solely focusing on clickbait. And recently something happened where there was a private letter that Ross Ulbrich sent to a very popular libertarian radio show. To an individual from that show saying, thanks for supporting me, blah, blah, blah. And he said a few private things in the letter which were meant to be private. And they went and published it as a headline saying, the first public letter from Ross Ulbrich. That is incredibly inappropriate. And the things that were in the letter actually had the potential of hurting him because of the position he's in. His lawyers were very worried. And his mother asked the people directly to take it down. And they wouldn't take it down until Ross spent his call quota and his own money, which he has almost none left, to call them and ask them to take it down. So I'm seeing this dishonesty in the name of profit, even in our own community. And Ross has written, they are not the first people to get a letter from Ross. I know many people that have gotten letters from us. And they did not go ahead and publish it. I do not publish my letters on my blog from Ross because I assume that they're private. And I think that the main word there is assume when it comes to that. And it's really interesting when it comes to private communication as what is private and what is public. And it really comes down to what you make private and what you make public. And I'm probably the oddest one of the whole decentralized group here. Because I have not made a certain, I haven't taken a stance on the Ross situation. Because I think obviously what he did is, you know, the freedom part of me says, oh, who cares, it's to each his own. But then the other part of me goes, well, when you play with fire and you get burned, and then you see that he got life in prison and I as a taxpayer have to pay for that, that is what bothers me actually the most. So I'm actually, you know, very interested in that more than anything else is the sentence. So I'm not going to go into that. I'm going to go into that. I'm going to go into that. But I think it's interesting to see how he's been in that situation. I think it's interesting to see how he's been in that situation. But I think it's interesting to see how he's been in that situation. Well, you should be upset with the state for having to pay those taxes, not with Ross, right? Absolutely, and that's, yeah, absolutely, and the judge. Mm-hmm. I mean, the whole, I just, I've had two interviews before this too. And there's one thing I just keep reiterating. The whole thing of whether Ross is guilty or not, and there's been a lot of finger-pointing at his supporters saying that we've been inconsistent. or one minute he's not DPR, the next minute he is DPR but go into a drug war. We have not changed their tune. His supporters maintain that he's innocent. And let me explain what we mean by innocent. If Ross is DPR the whole time, started it throughout, the only person who was DPR, if he was DPR some of the time and multiple DPRs are involved, if he wasn't DPR at all, all of those make him still innocent. Because at the end of the day, the Silk Road reduced harm, saved lives, and took violence off the streets. That is not even negotiable. So in an ethical sense, he is innocent. In a law sense, he's guilty. But so are people that follow the Muslim religion. And are under Muslim law that drink breast milk on the third full moon of the year. They're guilty to be punishable by death. So I mean, if you're guilty by law, anything can be made illegal, right? This whole trial situation and sentencing with Ross has me sick to my stomach. And it's been pretty upsetting for a lot of people, I'm sure. I understand you were at the trial. Were you also present at the sentencing? And can you tell us a little bit about your experience? I'm not sure if you've been at either of those. Yeah, I was at the trial. And if anybody wants to just get up to date with how it went down, I have very thorough videos on my channel. And it's Brave the World channel on YouTube. You can just search it. It's easy. Or my website, bravetheworld.com. But yeah, the trial itself was daunting. They really dragged it out. The prosecution was very brutal. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. And they panned it. But I had an interview with some people and he was a trademark protestor. And they panned it to a New York Ch mayor\u00eda party. And they panned it to their audience, which was a jury of his peers, which was not. Because they were all, most of them were government workers, and very basic people. Not to be rude, but a jury of his peers would be at least University graduates, pretty horrific and again the behavior from journalists was incredibly inappropriate I was misquoted Lynn was misquoted and then the same people who misquote us for their clicks come to our faces and say oh can I get another interview with you so I mean that was not a fun time I did buy I did get a flight to go see him during the sentencing but then the sentencing changed after I already booked my flight and I was I just didn't have the means to change it back and I decided to go home instead so one of the things you talked about a little bit earlier was this idea that things can be against the law by the state or by a central authority but still morally correct right or morally or the inverse things can be morally wrong and still perfectly legal can one of the things I think you pursued a lot of people pursued very early on in sido to trial was this idea of turing of location where if the jury feels that the law itself is on just they can you know not convict the person in the courtroom actually means been nullified at law that sentence that's a constitutional right buyy the judge right before the jury went to deliberate she she actually said you you even if you don't agree with the law you still have to judge according to the law. So she was alluding to the fact that journalification exists. She knew that most of those people are uninformed, but she still took the precaution to dismiss any cloudiness in their mind in case they were leaning in that direction. So she was very adamant about being against the concept of journalification. The law is the law, and you know, he did this, this, and this, therefore he broke this, this, and that law, therefore he's guilty. Morality or, you know, that did not counter it at all. Yeah, it was kind of tragic, and now it's kind of an inverse state where the state is the one committing the violence against a morally innocent individual, right? And that's sort of the travesty of it all. What is the role... go ahead. Just playing on that, he's a non-violent criminal, okay? He's a criminal by the law. He's a non-violent criminal with no history, and he's going to be sent to a maximum security prison for life with rapists and sociopaths and murderers? Like, does... he... that is... that is a complete infringement on any kind of human rights, even by the most, like, by the most basic standards. Well, and what's interesting is in the community, you know, everybody feels that he largely helped to remove violence from the system. So what do you think is the role? What can we gain from this? And what can we do today, first and foremost? And then what can we do to make sure that things like this, this absurdity doesn't ever happen again? Um, Geoffrey Tucker wrote a cool article, and he named, um, Russell Brick the Socrates of today, and he named all of these historic characters that were prosecuted for being, you know, a trill blazer and making like a water, you know, a watershed in history because of their achievement. and then we look back on it and we're like oh we probably shouldn't have punished them for doing what they did and you know he's being very positive and he hopes that'll be the case I would love to believe that but I see where America is moving, what direction it's moving in and I think it's just becoming more morally bankrupt and I think people you know a lot of these people who are anti Silk Road or anti-Ross a lot of them are like these liberal atheists right and liberal atheists pride themselves on not needing a God or a higher power right they pride themselves on thinking for themselves yet they're actually replacing the belief in God and originally Christianity was very anarchistic and Christians were prosecuted for not worshipping the state in Rome and if you read anything that Jesus said he was a total anarchist and anti-authoritarian and pro-peace and non-violence and these very same people just replace religion with the worship for the state which is a million times worse and then they think that they're these progressive forward thinking individuals and a lot of them should be anti drug war right and a lot of them are anti-drug war but no it doesn't count for the Silk Road because Ross made a profit and profit is evil because they're all socialists so somehow because Ross made a profit from the Silk Road negates any good that the Silk Road did exactly yeah and you know as a follow up something you said a moment ago too when you were talking about the sentencing and you know just how he was sentenced with murderers, rapists, violent criminals I think that actually is something more than being morally bankrupt is really the tragic aspect of this experiencing this murdering which is really painful you continue on about what he accomplished about cutest possible as people call it specifically for Russell and when you look places that maybe people have remembered they even made a big mistake when we listen to this they still have hope for the appeal process because on paper there is like so many brass hooks to hang an appeal on but um i think he was made an example of and i think judge forest's only um job because of her influence from chuck schumer was to make an example of him and that's just the sad circumstance of his existence he was the first and he's gonna be adequately punished and everyone's gonna know and there's gonna be a media campaign against him and they're gonna slander him to the point of labeling him as a murderer whether or not it was proven there wasn't even bodies and the and the site was ran by their own feds at that point and it's quite obvious that they faked it by now",
