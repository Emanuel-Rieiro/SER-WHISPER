    "text": " on the side of the front page of Sunday Times yesterday, many of you might have seen a report, no children, no country for children. And I skimmed it. I want to go back to it. I was just horrified when I first looked at some of those numbers. And it's amazing how many children in this country die because of homicide, how many babies in this country die at home because of respiratory and other illnesses that are not picked up on easily. And I thought to myself ahead of today's conversation when I read the Sunday Times, you know, today we're going to be talking about the very difficult issue of sexual abuse, sexual predation, including in our homes, places that we deem safe. We often think that it's strangers out there who are sexual predators. That is not the case. And then on top of that, not only are our children victims and survivors of sexual abuse, but it also seems as if we are also killing them. And I mean, it's really, really horrific. So the next hour will be a difficult conversation. But I also hope you'll find it empowering. Empowering because we need to ask the question, what are the warning signs? What do you look out for? What are healthy ways of instilling in our children the ability to be able to learn to speak out and to spot and to separate someone who is just grooming them, who is building trust in order to prey on our children from someone that can actually be, a healthy figure in their lives. So we're focusing on childhood sexual abuse and in particular, protecting children from threats that loom within. The lines will be open throughout. If you want to share your stories, if you have questions, I'll introduce my guest in a second. Please feel free to call in. It is a safe space. And I'm hoping that we can do a little bit in the next 51 minutes or so to try and be as pragmatic as possible about such an emotionally difficult conversation. O double one. Double. Eight. Three. Oh, seven. Oh, two in Johannesburg and in Cape Town on O two one double four six. Oh, five, six, seven. I'm joined in the studio by Dr. Shada Omar. Feel like I know where she just does such amazing work. But it's the first time we've actually met and she's in the studio director of clinical services at the Teddy Bear Clinic. Thank you so much for coming in. I really do appreciate it. Thank you for having me. And I look forward to this engagement and opportunity. I first want to start with some facts. It's about the big picture, if I may, Shahida. And, you know, the University of Cape Town has released the study on national incidents of sexual abuse in May 2016. For me, the numbers are so staggeringly high that I almost am, as with our crime stats every year, I'm almost disinclined to try and keep my attention span to look at the details and in the patterns. But I guess the first question is, when we look at national incidents, what do... what do the most reliable latest data tell us in terms of volumes of sexual abuse involving children? Are things roughly consistently horribly bad or are the numbers, despite being bad in absolute terms, showing a pattern that is a bit hopeful? What are the facts? Well, I think what you've highlighted here is it's not an either or situation, Yusuf. Yes, it's a both and situation. The incidence of sexual abuse is a two-sided situation. The incidence of sexual abuse is a two-sided situation. The incidence of sexual abuse continues to remain alarmingly high. You informed the listeners about the recent research that was conducted by the Child Justice Crime Prevention Center in Cape Town at UCT. And their findings illustrated that one in five children are victims of sexual abuse. And, of course, this includes both girls. And boys. However, it is more frequently reported by girls. It has also been found that just under 800,000 children are victims of sexual abuse before the age of 17 years. And this is not only consistent with national findings, but also aligned to the global findings. So the incidence continues to remain very high. But one needs to consider that these are children that are making reports and coming forward, whilst there are many incidences that are still remaining underreported. One of the interesting stats about the differences between boys and girls, if I have it right, is that boys report a higher lifetime prevalence rates of sexual abuse, 36.8%. Girls, 33.9%. Even though, as you said, girls are more likely. And so, I think it's important to maybe report on those. But before I get to what it is that we can do practically, I think one of the challenges we have in the media, especially, I think you would agree with me, Dr. Omar, when it comes to even discussions around sexual abuse, is the profile of the abuser. Who it is that we are having a conversation about when we are having a conversation about sexual predation. Yeah. And we still have, wittingly or unwittingly, certain ideas in our head that a sexual abuser is an alien, is a monster, is someone out there, can't be Thomas, it can't be Eusebius, it can't be dad, it can't be your favorite auntie, for example. Does the research shed any light on that question? Thank you for that. I think that's a very important question. And I would like to just clarify. I think that's a very important question. I think that's a very important question. If we look around us, who are we going to, how are we going to be able to identify who is the predator? It could be your nice next door neighbor. It could be the rabbi. It could be the imam. It could be the excellent computer or maths teacher. It could be the, you know, sports coach. So, it could be the likes of you and me. There is no definite and clear profile identifying the alleged abuser. And that is what is actually quite scary. What one needs to understand is that it is usually somebody that has easy access and availability to children or to a child. It is somebody more likely to be known to that child. In 80 to 90 percent of the cases that we deal with, we have found that it is always someone that the child, usually has some form of relationship with. And I think that is what one needs to take cognizance of. That it's not your typical stranger danger. When we were growing up, we were always cautioned and warned about the person on the street corner or the person calling you to the car. Yes, that does happen. That is a risk factor. But if we look at the prevalence and incidence of abuse that occurs and that are being reported or being discussed, it is usually somebody that has close contact with the child. And that's what we mean by this phrase, the threat that looms within. Because that threat can be closer than you actually think. In my case, when I was sexually preyed on and raped, it was by a cousin of mine who had, in fact, a relationship of trust with me that he had built up over many years. So, he was exactly that math tutor that you're talking about. And he was an SRC president in high school when I was in primary school. So, the perfect role model. If mom and dad had to go out to Lang Aram, he would be the one entrusted to bath us, to look after us. He would go on a Sunday after church to go and sing as a member of the youth group at church to the elderly at the old age home. And so, what was interesting in my case, Shahida, is that all the elements of trust were there. And I was saying to my producer, Laura, you know what is so interesting, and I know this will resonate with many moms and dads for whom this is a conversation about raising children, but who themselves are survivors of childhood sexual abuse, that sometimes it's even difficult to recognize what you have experienced because the trust was so solid that your memory that you carry into adulthood is not one of being a survivor of sexual abuse. And that is, isn't it, that kind of grooming, that is the heart of the modus operandi of sexual predators. Absolutely. I think what we often find is the questions primary caregivers, significant others, would ask the child victim, why didn't you stop this or why didn't you tell me? And it is because of this grooming that you have identified. Grooming is such a sophisticated mechanism that is applied and implemented in the relationship where the barriers are slowly broken down and a relationship is formed. And it is usually around the misused love. You know, it is a way of gaining support, enlisting the support of the child and enlisting trust. And often they pray, they pray for the child to be a good person. And it is a way of gaining support and enlisting the support of the child. And it is a way of gaining support and enlisting the support of the child. And it is a way of gaining support and enlisting the support of the child. We know that parents often find themselves in situations where they are so busy, they are so hectic, they are involved in trying to survive financially, working themselves to the bone and not having sufficient time or opportunities available to be physically and emotionally available to the child. And predators will use this, will capitalize on this very, very opportunity where the child is in need of some kind of affection or approval. And they will use the grooming process, slowly breaking down those barriers, playing with the child, rolling in the sand, you know, playing games, innocuous games, very innocent games, starting off very carefully, very strategically manipulating the child, where the child becomes quite dependent. And then once those barriers are broken down, And then once those barriers are broken down, And then once those barriers are broken down, the child is actually afraid to lose that relationship. When the child is preyed upon, it's not that the child is enjoying that, but the child is afraid sometimes of losing that relationship. Absolutely. I saw a devastating status update on Facebook the other day with a very good friend of mine who recalled abuse that she had experienced at the hand of a grandfather. And she's a brilliant professional, obviously now dealing with childhood trauma and recalling it. And it was just so interesting how we can be scarred for life as a result of that kind of abuse of trust on the part of the predator and the one who's been grooming you. And what's interesting to me is that at one point in her reflection on how she was groomed and abused by her grandfather, Dr. Omar, is that as a child of about 10 or 11 years, she actually believed that she was in love with her grandfather, in love with him. Such was the level of sophisticated emotional manipulation. Indeed. And I think that is usually the emotional scarring that that victim has to live with because often they are wracked with guilt. We had a young child at the age of 12 who came to the clinic who was impregnated, but there was not... not able or not in a position to identify the alleged perpetrator. She gave a story where she said it was a total stranger. And 12 years after that, she came back to the clinic telling us about that it was a matter of incest. But she also described the same feelings that you have now expressed, where she said that she felt that she was in love with the alleged perpetrator, and it was therefore very difficult for her to make that disclosure. But she was now in a position where she was ready to make the disclosure. So it's that grooming process. And often they are wrecked with guilt that they allowed this to happen, that they actually enjoyed it. Our bodies are designed in a certain fashion. And I think that's what the listeners need to be aware of, that if it is rubbed in a certain fashion, it's going to evoke pleasurable sensations. And this is what we need to be aware of. And this is what she experienced and therefore was riddled with guilt where she started suffering from self-destructive, self-defeating behavioral patterns, where there was self-mutilation, and she was indulging in substances, taking lots of drugs. And these are some of the mental health disorders that one sees, the consequences of being a victim of sexual abuse, and not being able to do it. And not receiving any form of support or intervention. 21 minutes after 10, if you've just tuned in, we are speaking to Dr. Shahida Omar from the Teddy Bear Clinic. And we're talking about childhood sexual abuse, the very sophisticated ways in which sexual predators groom our youngsters, ourselves, many of us are survivors of this kind of sexual abuse. But we're also now parents or in positions of trust in relation to young children. What does that mean for how we treat them? for how we teach them to be able to recognize what is a healthy relationship with an adult in a duty of in a position of care towards them and what are the warning signs to look out for if you want to share your story so you have questions do give us a call on 011-883-0702 in Johannesburg and in Cape Town on 021-446-0567",
