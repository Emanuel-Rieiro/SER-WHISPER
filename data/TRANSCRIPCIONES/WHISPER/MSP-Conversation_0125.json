    "text": " Lauryn Hill, Jay-Z, two of your biggest influences. Yeah. You've met both of them now. Yes. Tell me the story of meeting each of them and what that was like. Yo, that first time meeting Jay-Z, it was like magic. It was like the way that we met, if anything would have gone differently, it was like any split second of me picking up a piece of paper, I would not have met him. That's just how on time everything was. We were in New York at the House of Blues, and it was myself and 9th and Fonte on tour. And I think Holo had came up with us to New York. And Angel, he was having, I think it was a birthday party down at a bowling alley. So it was in walking distance, the House of Blues. So we're trying to get out after the show, 9th is talking to this person, Holo is talking to this person, I'm talking to this person. And then we wait on Holo to get the merch, and then we got to go to the show. And then we got to walk down there, and 9th's still getting stopped to take pictures. And we finally get to the venue, and we're Zulu Nation, so the guy at the door, he was Zulu. And 9th didn't tell me this, but he'll be like, most of the time if you go somewhere and you see a Maybach parked out front, there's a chance that it could be Jay-Z. So there were two Maybachs out front, but I didn't think anything of it. But I'm thinking 9th did. But I'm just walking up, we talking about Zulu Nation, and I hear the guy and 9th, and they're whispering or whatever. I still don't think nothing of it. I'm just like, oh, they talking. So we walk in, and we get on the elevator, and it's the elevator where the door you walk in, the opposite door you go out of. So when we walk in, we go down one floor, and the door opens. But because of the way we walk in, 9th walked in first. So when the door opened, he's tall, he's 6'3\", so he goes, hey, man, what's up? And I'm behind him. It's 9th, another guy. And I can't see who it is. I hear him talking to him. He's like, I got this artist. Like, yo, you are her greatest influence. She might be one of your biggest fans. You got to meet her. And he's thinking I'm directly behind him, but I'm not. So he grabs the guy, and he's like, oh, this is my man Rory. But let me let you meet my artist. And when I saw him, it was like I was thankful I wasn't right behind him because I had a second to compose myself. You know what I mean? Like, it was like a moment. Like, I was fucked up for a second. So he goes, and, you know, I don't even remember what I said. Like, I just remember shaking his hand. He said something. I don't know what it is. But I guess he saw that I was fucked up a little bit. He put his hands on my shoulder, and he just nodded. I mean, that was the first time meeting Jay. But after that, you know, I met him three more times after that. And every time, like, he's always the same, humble, cool, like, real laid back. And I still don't know if he's ever heard the music. So, and Lauren, it was real quick. Like, it was right after she performed at Rock Like a Girl. And the hallway was packed. They were waiting for her to come out, you know, to talk to people. And I was the first one in line. So, you know, I just asked her for advice and told her, you know, how much she was an influence. And she gave me advice. And I told her I was going to move out of the way because I could feel everybody breathing on my neck. Like, so, but it was cool. Like, and I met her twice since then. So it's really dope. Yeah. Back to Jay-Z. What significance does the Black album have to your career? Oh, man. You are, it was always on point. That was one of my homework assignments. When I first met 9th and he heard the first two songs I had written or recorded, you know, he was like, you're a superstar. You got it. He was like, you just need to be coached. And you have to work on your flow and your cadence a little bit. So he gave me homework of, you know, about five or six albums to study. And he told me to go memorize them from front to back, word for word, but not memorize so much what they said, but how they said it. You know, how they wrote the beat, where they breathed that, how they, what inflections they put on certain words. So Jay-Z was my favorite artist and 9th named the Black album as one. So that was the one I studied probably the most. That might have been the only one I studied. But, you know, I just used to ride and listen to it every single day. And, you know, I. Every day, front to back, until I had the whole thing memorized from front to back, like to the point where every day I would get in the shower and I would start with the first song. And, you know, I might take a long shower, but I would rap every song from beginning to end. So, you know, that was my homework. What's the most impressive aspect of that album to you? Wow. Just his ability. You know, if we're talking about the science of rhyme, just his ability to be simple. But complex at the same time. You know, that's the beautiful thing of Jay. And I think that's why he's been able to be as successful as he is and keep reinventing himself. Because he's still complex and he still know how to use a complex simile and metaphor. But the average person can still get it. Like, it's not too far over your head. Like, the setup is crazy. And, you know, I really appreciate, like, how he did that on this album. And, you know, the honesty in the music. You know, like, one of my favorite songs is Moment of Clarity. Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well. Like, you know, his cadence and his charisma on a track, like, is bar none, man. Not too many can do that. Like, that's what separates him from a lot of people. Like, you know, you have MCs that are lyrical all day. But what separates one from the next as far as, you know, who's better is their charisma sometimes and how they say what they say. So, that's what I love the most about Jay-Z and that part. So, the Black Album was one of the albums you were given to listen to. I believe Low End Theory was another one. Yeah. What were the other three or four? Snoop's Doggy Style. I can't even remember. Just stuck to the Black Album and just forgot everything else at the time. There were two. Yeah, I really did. I think there were two Tribe albums. Midnight Marauders was one, too. Yeah, I can't remember the rest. I know that Jay-Z was in there, though. It was definitely Snoop, Jay, and Tribe, like, were the main ones. On a related note to that, in getting into Beauty and the Beast, Young Guru mixed the EP. How did that come about? Guru, he's like family. Like, that's big brother. So, you know, I really wanted this one to sound good. Crisis usually does that mix, and he does a great job. But, you know, Crisis... His main focus is making beats. And I wanted somebody who really had a passion for engineering. And Guru's one of the best and not the best at it in the game. So, you know, I asked Knife. Knife actually reached out to him. He was like, yo, man. He was like, let us know what we need to do, how much we need to pay, whatever. And, you know, we just kind of made that happen that way. So, you know, as busy as he is, like, he fit me into his schedule and made it happen. But Guru's like family. Like, you know, him and Knife are best friends. And, you know, that's my big brother. So, there you go. If we can get into a couple lines off of Beauty and the Beast. You have one on Who I Am that goes, Faith is believing in something they'll never show me. Tell me about that line. Faith is believing in something they'll never show me. Like, you know, at the time, I took it to mean, you know, you always can't see it. You just got to believe it. And, you know, that's what... That's what faith is. So, you know, necessarily, you just got to go kind of with your intuition and what feels right a lot of times before you're able to see it actually unfold in front of you. And that's basically what it means in a nutshell. Like, just having faith to do something, though you necessarily can't see it at the time. You got to have faith that somewhere down the line, it's going to happen. So... I think of a very similar line on Hard to Choose. You rap about making the choice to walk out... Put on faith and do what feels right. You're a University Accounting graduate, NC State. You ultimately choose to go into music. When and how did that decision come to take that leap of faith and go for, you know, I may have this degree, but I want to get into hip-hop? You know, just not being able to ignore what was really inside and what you really want to do. Like, ever since I was probably like five or six, I knew I wanted to do music. You know, it was first Michael Jackson. Just, you know... Me falling in love with him and his entertaining. And then I got into hip-hop. And when I saw MC Lyte, like, I knew I wanted to be a rapper. But because of where I was from, like, you know, I didn't think it was possible. You know, I was even scared. I didn't think I was good enough. I just had to really get around the right people that were going to nourish and grow... Help grow me and really show me, like, you can really do anything you want to do. So, you know, I got around Cooley High. I got around 9th. And, you know, they're dream chasers. Like, no excuse. Anything you want to be, you can do it. Like, you know, be your own boss. You don't want to live life and have any regrets. Even if you don't make it, at least you can say, I tried. So, you know, it was just more getting around the people, you know, that were positive about it. And that would push me and have my back. Because I knew, like, my family wouldn't really understand. They wouldn't get it. But they get it now. So, you know, that's the beautiful thing about it. So, you know, I just couldn't ignore it. Like, accounting wasn't my passion. Like, I took it because... Because I was good at math. Like, you know, I'm in college and I'm thinking, like, everybody knows what they want to do. I want to be an engineer. You know, I want to start my own business. Like, all I wanted to do was music. But it's like, you know, is that really possible? Can you do that? And it's just like, man, I'm good at math. My older sister is an accountant. So, I'm going to take accounting. Like, no passion for it whatsoever. So, you know, just not being able to ignore it and get around the right people. And you hear it enough. Like... Oh, just try it. Go for it. Go for it. You're like, fuck it. I'm going to do it. So... You've got a line on Who I Am going back to this song again. You say, don't be flirting with your gift. You better marry it. You nervous? Describe what's going through your head in the years between, you know, graduating and finally making a mark in the music industry. Feeling like you're secure in the field that you've chosen. Wow. It's a real moment of awakening. Like, the music business is not what you thought it was. When you were growing up, like, you know, it wasn't as easy as, oh, you're talented. Get a record deal. Boom. You're on. Like, it's nothing like that. Especially not today. And how much the internet changed everything. Like, you know, I've dropped my first solo project in December of 2010. And I'm seven projects deep. And we're just now really breaking ground. And I think a lot of artists don't understand how much work goes into that. How much... How much patience you have to have. Especially if you want to be an artist that's going to be around for 20 years and have a strong foundation like you. It takes a lot of time to build that. You know, you think it's really easy. But, you know, that's what it is. So just having faith that, you know, everything is going to work out. You know, you drop one project and you think, oh, this is going to be the one. And it ain't the one. You drop another one. Oh, we're going to... No, it's not the one. So it's just really being patient and having faith and being honest. And just to keep pounding. Like, you know, you hear people say a lot of times, like, right before you get your big reward is right when it's really the hardest. Like that moment right before you feel like giving up. That you just got to keep going. And that's kind of what it's always been. Like there have been some hard days. It's just like, ah, I can't do this no more. But I love it too much. And, you know, I have faith. Like little wins or little signs. Like keep going. You're almost there. So that's what it is. Just having faith. That it'll work out. Think back to what the first moment would have been where you start to feel like there's this break. This, you know, shining light of this moment where suddenly you feel it all kind of coming into place. Wow. I think like with every project, like there was always something different. Whether, you know, it was Ali Shahid tweeting me. You know, like, you know, or, you know, not getting a text from somebody. It's like, yo, such and such really likes your music. Or, you know, you got this great review that, you know, they're saying all these great things. Like it's a bunch of different things. You know, going to Japan and getting the love that you get there. It's like, wow. South Africa was a really, really big awakening. Like I was doing shows here in the States, you know, anywhere from like 100 to 300 people. And I go over there and it's 900 people. Like crying and grabbing your ankles and reciting. And the lyrics, like it's like, wow, that was eye-opening for me. So, you know, with everything is different. Like even the tweet from Missy and the one from Questlove. Like, you know, it's always something to keep building off of. You know, getting the email the other day that we made Billboard. Like that was nuts. You know, I didn't expect that. So I was like, wow. Like so every project, you know, I have faith. Like as long as I don't have a step back. As long as we grow and improve. Then, you know, that's all you can ask. And after a while, you know, you're going to be where you want to be. As long as you keep moving up the mountain. Where does your confidence and your perseverance come from? And what sort of influence did your parents and grandparents have on you? Wow. And my parents and my grandparents, they were both very hard workers. Like, you know, both my grandparents owned farms. They made the kids work. You know, you had to get in that field. Whether it was getting corn or tobacco. Or whatever. You know, my dad, he worked shift work. You know, my mom, she works out. She paints China on. She paints the gold on China. So, you know, they're very hard workers. Like she would come home from work and cook us dinner. Like I have five brothers and sisters. She'd cook us dinner. She'd clean up full clothes. Like every day. And it's just like you see how hard they work. And it's just like, you know, you can't be lazy in this life. You got to work for everything you want. And basketball played a big thing in that too. Like, you know, I love basketball. And I was really good at it. And I was the first one to practice. And the first one to lead. And I was also the team captain. So, you know, it taught me a lot about teamwork and how to be a leader. You know, when we had somebody that was doing suicides and they were running slow. Somebody had to step up and motivate them and keep running with them. And that had to be me. I was the leader. So, you know, it just taught me a lot about, you know, hard work. And, you know, you just got to keep going. You just got to. Like every day is not going to be a bad day. But, you know, in the grand scheme of things, you know, life can be beautiful. You control your own destiny. On Who I Am You Rap, Auntie shared some wisdom said in life you must be cunning. Can you dig into that line a little bit? Yeah, like I got a lot of aunts. I have five aunts on my mom's side. And I got three on my dad's side. And, you know, they're just always giving me advice. Like, you know, I'm not going to be a bad dad. My aunt, I call her Aunt Dale. Like, I'll go see her. And, you know, we'll just talk about life and, you know, how you got to be smart. And, you know, where wisdom comes from and listening to your elders and those that have walked the path. So, you know, just being smart and making the right decisions and the right moves. And being aware of everything that's going around with you and listening more than you talk. Like that's where you get your wisdom from, you know. And that's. That's what saves you a lot of trouble and saves you a lot of steps. So, you know, just got to play life, you know, the right way. It's chess. It's not checkers. It's definitely chess. You were mentioning earlier how one of the positives of this past year has been more and more people recognizing you as an emcee above all else. Not just, you know, a female emcee. I want to ask you about a quote of Oprah Winfrey. She says, excellence is the best deterrent to sexism. Tell me about that quote. You know, it's just being great at what you do and not boxing yourself in. You know, so me and 9th always said, like, we're not going to focus on me being a female rapper and trying to be the best female rapper and trying to be, you know, the female cheerleader. I want to be the best emcee, period. And, you know, once you're so good at something, you know, people can't box you in and they have to recognize you solely for your talent and who you are. So you have to be excellent. And excel well at what you do to kind of beat yourself out of any box, whether it be race or gender or religion or, you know, class. You know, you have to be excellent at what you do. So, you know, that's why that's probably one of my favorite quotes from her. And, you know, that's why she is what she is today. Like, she never let that she was a black female hold her back. She just wanted to be the best at what she did. And she is. So. Ninth Wonder also had a quote I want to ask you about your perspective on. He said, there's a certain stigma with being from the South and having lyrics like you have to be more animated or make yourself a cartoon. Tell me about that. Yeah, we had just been reading reviews and, you know, she's monotone and she doesn't switch her voice up. And I'm thinking like on this project, that was what we did more on this one than any other project. You know, we really experimented and tried some new things. And I really found my voice on that one. And we just thought it was funny. Like, you know, there would be other artists that were just as monotone or if not more. And they would get praised for their lyricism. And, you know, you wouldn't hear any talk of, you know, how monotone they were. And it's just like it's because they're from New York or or or L.A. or Chicago or this big city. And, you know.",
