    "text": " Please tell her I say hello. Oh, that's so nice. Please tell her I say hi back. Yeah. She was like, did you know one time I dressed up as her for Halloween? Oh, my gosh. Amazing. And I was like, no, but that's a great story. That is. I love knowing that. When I was a freshman in high school, someone like a neighborhood mom didn't know I lived in Oak Park, Illinois, and thought I was dressed up as me for Halloween. She was like, are you the blogger girl? Are you dressed up as her? You're like, bitch. I am the blogger girl. It me. You're like, I invented that meme. Yeah. Is it funny to you that old women are like, you're inspiring? You are not an old woman. But is it fun? It's so nice. I mean, I think that's cool. I feel inspired by people who work for Rookie who are younger than me, where I'm like. Oh, my God. A few weeks ago, I went to this thing in New York called Teen Art Salon. And it was all this work from by teenagers. And I normally find artists for Rookie because people are posting their stuff on Instagram and Tumblr and whatnot. But these were like teenagers who really weren't trying to put themselves out there. And it was really special to see the stuff they had been making just for themselves. And then they were kind of begrudgingly like, OK, you can use it. But I was like, oh, wow. Yeah. The goal really is to be like 15 years old and be able to just like be alone and explore your ideas. And then like a few days later, I interviewed Adrian Tamina. And he said that he's always trying to make cartooning feel the way it did when he was a teenager. When you just like shut the world out and time disappears. It's funny, but it's like super nice. I feel like there's a lot that can be learned from. I don't know. Younger people. Yeah, I agree. Sorry, I just get excited when I talk about. No, I like there's teens. There's something to me about like I think there's something really disingenuous about the notion that art isn't anything unless you make it for other people or like axiom or whatever that goes around. That's like, are you a writer if no one ever reads your stuff? Are you an artist if no one ever sees it? And I think that's like incredibly disingenuous. I remember in at some point in high school, I became aware that like, oh, maybe it. Was affecting me in some negative way that I am so accustomed to having an audience and that my brain is developing as I am like getting feedback on on things. And so I started keeping a journal and I became obsessed with people like Henry Darger, who just was a I think a custodian who lived in Chicago, I think. And when he passed away, they found all of this stuff in his house where he had just created this really elaborate world through paintings and writing. All these stories of these. Children, the Vivian girls. That's where the band gets their name. And like Rookie is meant to service its readers. But there is I always want there to be. You know, it's like there are the pieces that are more instructive and concretely about whatever the reader is going through. And then there's stuff that's just like, look at what this girl made. Amazing. Her sketchbook. So cute. Not in much better words. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, there's something that's always like really fascinated me about. I mean, it's like that's like the thing that I was like, yeah, I've got to do it. Yeah. I've got to do it. I've got to do it. I've got to do it. I've got to do it. I'm like, just burn it all. Just burn it. Just burn it. He is the best friend of a guy named Max Brode was there and he was like, you got to get rid of all of it. I'm a fucking terrible writer. Oh, my God. And then his friend was like, 100 percent. I'm definitely going to burn it all. Don't worry. And then Kafka died and he was like, totally JK. I'm publishing all of it. The unfinished stuff, it's getting published. The finished stuff, it's getting published. And I think that's fascinating that he was like on his deathbed was like, never mind. Right. Wow. I made all this art and it turns out like I don't want anyone to see it. You know, like I think pop music is so interesting because it accounts for like the listener and the listening experience. But we are in this day and age so accustomed to needing feedback or needing to be like acknowledged for everything we do for it to feel like it happened to generalize a lot. Not everyone feels that way, but I've certainly like grown up on the Internet. And it's not even just like if I've published it online, but just as a diary keeper, like if I've written it down or something. It's like if I didn't, then it didn't happen. And then I'm confused. But then I'm like, well, I can't spend half my day writing about the other half of the day because I'm like, that's the day. I like that. I read an interview with you recently where you were talking about sort of like. Interviewers asking celebrity women about like, are you a feminist? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And like, that's fascinating to me because I think that like asking them that question because, you know, it's going to elicit a certain response is like disrespectful of women's humanity. Yeah, I agree. It's I mean, it always bothers me. I think there's a list somewhere of like. Jokingly, a joking list of like who is and isn't a feminist, according to just the headlines. And I think it just bothers me because it's not. Yeah, it makes feminism feel like, are you with us or against us? And it does sort of boil it down to like. It makes feminism seem like a buzzword and not a really complicated movement set of beliefs. Lived experience. Yeah. Some of that people's lives. Yeah. I think one of the things that I really like about Rookie is that the idea that it's this like a place for women to navigate and especially young women to navigate these kind of ideas without that outer sort of sphere of people being like, it's this or it's that. It's just sort of like, this is how I feel about things. And it's okay for us to talk about them and we can sort of navigate them in a way that is like safe for all of us. Yeah. Thank you. That makes me really happy to hear you say that because I feel like I often. Yeah. I feel like I often. Yeah. Have been like something that a lot of. I'm often asked like, what's the toughest issue that teenagers or young women are facing today? It's like it never. Like I don't have any answers. I don't know how to fix anything. I also don't think that that question makes sense because there are so many people on this Earth. But if it feels like a place where it's safe to question things and try and find one's own answers, then that makes me really happy. Yeah. And I also think people kind of just take more and more. I mean, this has changed so much even in the years since Rookie started just that like Tumblr has become a lot more popular and people take more and more cues from just each other. Mm-hmm. Like I don't think well. Representation in mainstream media is very important, but I don't think it's it's not the only thing the way it was when like my parents were growing up and they wouldn't have really known about anything other than what they saw on TV or read in the paper. I definitely come from a world where like I was a very political teenager. But if you'd asked me when I was a teenager, if I was a feminist, I would have given you some bunk answer about being a humanist. Right. And like without knowing what that meant. Yeah. Knowing that that didn't mean anything. Mm-hmm. And I just think that like I have kids like schooling me in feminist theory and like all of that. The just the thoughtful analysis is. Yeah. Wild and it's it's cool. It's fucking cool. Yeah. I mean. Even in the. I mean, I feel like I hope I'm learning and growing all the time. But yeah, even since rookie has started, I feel like the way that I think about my job at rookie has changed so much just from that feedback from readers and also from seeing. Yeah, people on Tumblr Twitter who I don't even know if they are rookie readers or not, but I'm just happy that these conversations don't feel as insular. Yeah. Well, actually, this is kind of just mean. But I was just going to say. I feel like, okay, you know, when you're at like something and someone's phone goes off and people roll their eyes and it's sort of assumed that young people are on their phones all the time. It's always like an older person who didn't know how to turn it off. Yeah. And I feel like I get way more annoyed at like my parents for looking at their phones than they do with me. And it's because we're kind of used to it and have come up with it. But my dad is like, look at this tiny robot. Yeah. And like I. So I just feel the need to set the record straight. Yeah. But older people spend more time on their phones. Yeah. And then when they're on their phones, too, they like never figured out how to turn off the noises that it makes when you type. You're like, turn that fucking shit off. Yeah. I can hear you from 15 feet away having a text message conversation. Taking accidental selfies. Oh, it's cute. I know. I'm also generalize. I'm really only talking about like three old people. Yeah. Sometimes I'm bad for like generalizing about boomers. And then my dad is like, like hella technologically advanced. Oh, really? Like his job or something. No, he's just like a weirdo that like I think the first time he ever saw calculator. He was like, dog, what is this? And then he was like, we've had we had a computer since I was like seven. So, you know, back in the day, like they weren't incredibly affordable, but my dad's really like pieced one together. So he's always like he's actually is really fast at texting. Oh my gosh. What a guy. It's terrifying. But my mom loves to send me like text messages that end in love mom. So, you know, it's so cute. The real spectrum, you know. Oh my God. My mom now she has an iPhone and maybe it's more intuitive. But for a while she had like a slide phone and she didn't know how to like delete typos or characters. She didn't mean to type. So I'd get a text that would be like, hey, and then all these numbers and then like like an accidental. Smiley and like all these letters and then like, oops, when will you be home? So cute. My best friend taught her mom had to use emojis and her mom is like one of the smartest women I've ever met. She's like a high-powered business woman. Like she's the kind of business woman that if you ask me what she did, I'd be like, I don't know. Yeah. Business. But she like, my best friend will like turn her phone to me. And she'll have a message from her mom. That's like the like just emojis for till that I'm like is your mom your that's next level. Your mom's trying to tell us something. Yeah, right. She's a problem. Even though I was like Trisha's on some next level communicating seriously. She's a millennial. She's an honorary millennial.",
