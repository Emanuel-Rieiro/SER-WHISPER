    "text": " links. Free Talk Live will collect a portion of your purchase total. So when you go to shop.freetalklive.com, pick the right one for you. There's Amazon UK, Amazon Canada, and of course, Amazon US. Go to whichever one's best for you and do your shopping and feel good because you're getting the stuff you want and you're helping Free Talk Live at the same time. Once again, shop.freetalklive.com. There's some other vendors there like New Egg as well. And if you shop through the New Egg links, then we'll get a much smaller percentage, but we'll get something. The Amazon deal is certainly the best one for Free Talk Live. It's on that page. So let's go to, we'll continue with your calls here in a moment, but I want to make sure you know about the Free State Project, freestateproject.org, now with over 13,000 people on board. We've been saying this for years, but if everyone who's a Free State Project member could just find one person, we'd be at 20,000. Tomorrow. Yeah. If everyone could do it tomorrow. If you could do it by the end of the year, that'd be great. If you could find one lovely person who's a Free State Project member, we'd be at 20,000. Tomorrow. Yeah. If everyone one friend who has not yet signed on that maybe wants to, and then help them, walk them through the process of signing on, that would be fantastic because we've seen a nice little uptick in the amount of people that have been signing up for the Free State Project recently. And I think if things continue at the same level they're at, then we'll be at 20,000 within a couple of years, which would be nice because I remember original projections being sometime in like 2026 or something. So things have definitely been increasing. And I expect to see that happen as we get closer to 20,000. Like as that number that, because 20,000 is the goal, we're at 13 now. So as that number gets closer and closer, hopefully there will be more people who've been kind of waiting in the wings to see, oh, well, I'll sign on if it gets to 15,000, or I'll sign on at 19,000, or whatever it is that people tell themselves. Also, whatever media there is, whatever kind of buzz there is about the increase of signups. Sure. Just the more there is, the more there is. The success breeds success. So hopefully we'll see that. Signup rate continue to increase. Frankly, to me, the 20,000 number doesn't really matter at all. I mean, I understand that that's the trigger that some people are probably, I mean, it's the trigger for the project. At 20,000, you're supposed to have five years to pick up and move. But it's not like they've got a team of mercenaries that's going to go out there and drag everybody at the five-year mark into New Hampshire. So, I mean, it's still a voluntary situation. The people that truly want to move voluntarily are picking up and moving voluntarily now. Yeah. It's better to move sooner rather than later. They're doing it already. So, I mean, to me, the 20,000 number doesn't mean anything because we already have success here in New Hampshire. And success is what's breeding the signups and the movers and all that sort of thing. I mean, the fact that New Hampshire had a 12% budget cut for the state budget, and I don't think any other state did, that to me speaks volumes. If you love the ideas of liberty, you understand what it means to be free, that you have to allow others to do what they want. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you love the ideas of liberty, you understand what it means to be free, then go to freestateproject.org, learn more, get the 101 reasons to move to New Hampshire and get signed up, and then find somebody else to sign up too, so we can get there sooner rather than later. Once again, freestateproject.org. As we continue the FBI investigating so-called anarchists in the Northwest, but also the Northeast, we've had the FBI attempt to infiltrate our happy little group of activists up here. Yes, but they're not anarchist groups. Well, but people do call them, some of the people up here call themselves anarchists. I don't like the term personally, but some people still, you know, they're, oh, it's sexy. Being an anarchist is dangerous. It's got that, you know, like a pirate. Pirates weren't cool, man. They didn't do cool things, but people, there's that sexy pirate factor. I don't know if pirates are sexy. I don't think anybody thinks that. Tough. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, the excitement part is probably attractive to some people, but according to the search warrant unsealed this week, the government claims that tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Resulted from the May 1st actions in Seattle, largely due to attacks on the William Kenzo Nakamura U.S. courthouse and a few private businesses in the vicinity. Video footage obtained from the scene has been endlessly analyzed by FBI detectives who have in weeks and months since tried to build a case to file charges against the suspects, none of whom are reported to include the three persons asked to testify. That investigation has led to filing not just subpoenas against the Pacific Northwest three, but executing no fewer than five search warrants in July that aim to recover cell phones, computers, clothes, and literature from Plante, her peers, and others believed to be in cahoots with any local anarchists. That one is weird to me. They're taking these people's clothes. Yeah. And their computers and their anarchist literature. I could only, I mean, I can see why someone, you know, why you might take a computer. You can find a lot of information on the computer. It is a information storage device. I'm not saying I support it. I think that there's some real problems with just wandering in and taking people's computers. Yeah. I don't like the idea that because I know people who are anarchists that they get to come in and take their computers. I don't like the idea that because I know people who are anarchists that they get to take my stuff. That's not cool. It doesn't make any sense to me. I'm not plotting any violence and nobody I know is plotting any violence, which is why the FBI never gets anywhere with whatever investigations they're doing up here. It gets in a bunch of places. It harasses the heck out of people. Well, they haven't done what they haven't done to us in the Northeast, what they've done to these folks in the Northwest. But that's because some of them are actually violent. Some of them actually are. You're right about that. I'm just saying whenever they're investigating here, they don't get anywhere because there's nothing for them to find out. The movement here is peaceful and anybody that comes in and starts advocating violence is ostracized. They're ejected. Yeah. So they're given the chance to change their mind. It's attempted. People attempt to persuade them otherwise. But otherwise, they are just basically shut out for the most part. And as it was being explained, one of the tenets of one of these sort of anarcho-socialist types is direct action. And that often means violence or vandalism and that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't doubt that people that are violent in these groups are probably not kicked out. In addition to being met with silence from the Northwest Three, the trove of evidence uncovered by the authorities has so far left them unable to release an indictment targeting their suspects. Indeed, or instead, rather, they have been left with cell phones that, according to the unsealed affidavit, contain text messages describing the May Day protest as awesome, but nothing more remotely noteworthy, or at least not enough to file charges. charges. While Plant has since been freed from prison while she was held in solitary confinement for refusing to comply with the grand jury, both Olgenich and Duran remain behind bars as investigators wait to see if they'll be willing to speak. What prosecutors decided to do is choose people and punish them for their association, an attorney, Jen Kaplan, tells the Seattle Times. To the paper, a counsel for Olgenich adds the grand jury investigation specifically sought answers from the anarchist about someone that she knows. Before being imprisoned and released, Plant said that a Freedom of Information Act request she filed revealed the grand jury was first convened in March, two months before the vandalism she's being questioned about even occurred. Before being held in contempt of court, Plant wrote, quote, the government wants to use grand juries to collect information that it can use in a campaign of repression. I refuse to have any part of it. I will never answer their questions. I will never speak. An attorney for Duran adds that while their client isn't being suspected or accused in the May 1st vandalism in Seattle, the associations that exist within the community are enough to keep him under the FBI's radar. The intended result, many fear, is a chilling effect on a community of like-minded individuals that could soon enshroud other groups of activists and outspoken youths. One of the attorneys says one of our concerns was they were really targeting him because they perceived him to be associated with the anarchist community. It's kind of a fishing expedition. So again, we don't know enough about these folks to make any, to jump to any conclusions about what they support and what they don't. We know there's no evidence that they support, any sort of violence. I don't think supporting violence means, is incarceration worthy either. No, I agree. Because look, I mean, the government is a violent organization. Lots of people support it. People will call in here and say, well, anybody who doesn't love, you know, America should die. I mean, people say that kind of stuff all the time. The fact is, if you support violence in support of the state, you're just a good red-blooded American. But if you support violence in, you know, against the state, then you're an evil anarchist. So, you know, I don't think that supporting violence means anything when it comes to convicting people doing violence. That's the issue. Absolutely. And we've certainly seen plenty of examples of how the FBI actually foments violence. In a lot of cases, they will send people into these groups. If they can't infiltrate this group and foment violence, that says to me that it's a relatively peaceful group, right? Right. And we don't know a lot about the details of what level of infiltration they had. That's not really where this story went in its detail. But that's happening. The FBI is sending people to sit in on Quaker meetings. Yeah. I mean, that shows... Those are violent people. Right. You know, these are people that have been pacifists for 300 years. They're going after dissenters, plain and simple. And they're using violence as their excuse, even though there's no evidence that these three were involved in any violence. And there's also no evidence that they supported that violence at this point. So if you know anything different, we'd love to hear. I'm going to post, send a message to... the Free Leah group on Facebook. See if she's going to be available for interview at some point. That way we can all stop speculating. You know, we'll just put the question out there about what sort of actions she supports. 855-453-THE-SACLE-CAI-TOLL-FREELINE. But the thing that remains to be clarified here is that they are infiltrating groups, peaceful groups. And in a lot of cases, it's the FBI that will attempt to foment the ideas of violence. They will attempt to encourage people to do violence or to destroy property. That has been documented. And offer weapons and arm them. That has been documented time after time after time. More coming up here. Hour 2 is next. You take control at 855-450-FREE. Free Talk Live.",
