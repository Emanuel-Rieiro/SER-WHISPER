    "text": " Welcome to the Macmillan Report. I'm Marilyn Wilkes, your host, and our guest is Fabian Drixler, Assistant Professor of History at Yale University. Professor Drixler teaches Japanese history. Today we talk with him about his forthcoming book, Infanticide and Fertility in Japan, 1650 to 1950. Welcome, Professor Drixler. Thank you. I'm delighted to be here. Let's begin talking about your book. Tell us a little bit about it. So the book is a cultural history. It's a history of infanticide and a demographic history of fertility change wrapped into one. One way to think about it is that there is this great turning point that I identify in the years around 1800. So in 1750, you have a world where in large parts of Japan, people will only try to raise two or three children, and some of those children will die. So at the end of the day, they'll have less than two descendants per couple. The way they achieve that? The way they achieve that is through widespread infanticide, mostly. By 1850, infanticide has been questioned, has been combated, has been widely discussed, and people once again now raise four or five children per couple. By 1920, they raise six kids, and infanticide is rapidly becoming something that is more or less unthinkable. So that's the great arc that I'm trying to describe with this book. And it is such a, it's an interesting topic, and I would imagine somewhat of a difficult one, infanticide. And you've looked at many different aspects of Japan. Why infanticide, for instance? Why write this book? Infanticide is a great window into people's minds, because the whole practice of it, which has become so unthinkable in our society, depends on the way that people imagine it. They imagine themselves in their universe and the way they understand when human life begins, what happens after death, both for the infants you kill and perhaps your ancestors who linger around the family as protective spirits. It relates in more complicated ways to the way you imagine the nature of time, the way you define community. So in that sense, it's a very attractive topic. So, what's the point of this book? It's a very interesting topic. I think it's a very interesting topic. I think it's a very interesting topic. The other reason, though, why I think it's so important is that demography is a great way to understand the past in many ways. And really, a colonization frontier of knowledge, there's shockingly little in many ways we know about the demographic past of our world. And there's been a huge amount of wonderful work over the past two or three generations. But the things we don't know are just astonishing once you contemplate them. Okay. And let's talk about your methodology. How did you do your research? So the research really has two major legs. The first leg is the demographic analysis of a large collection of individual-level data. So I spent many years going through libraries and archives, tracking down population registers from the 17th, 18th, and 19th century. And are they readily accessible? Yes. Okay. And some of them are. One wonderful thing about Japan is that each municipality has, at some point in the last 50 or 60 years, launched a local history project whereby they wrote up the history of their town. And even for small villages, these collections can run to 10 magnificent cloth-bound volumes. And in many of those, they collect the documents that are available locally. Type them up for you, publish them, and deliver them to the shelves of the Sterling Memorial Library. And this is especially important because the archival system of Japan, for the early modern period anyway, is not especially well developed. And so only a small fraction, maybe five, maybe 10 percent, of the surviving village-level documents from this period can actually be accessed in archives. All the rest is still owned by the descendants of the headmen, for instance, who created these documents in the first place. And so the only efficient way of accessing them without going through a long dance of gaining the trust of these individuals is to find them in these collections. That said, the archival collections have been really useful for my project as well. So something like a third of these population registers are things that I've found in archives. So that's the first leg. The second leg is a wonderful wealth of different collections. Okay. So, I think that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. And, you know, I always ask myself, what are the different types of materials on infanticide? And I say wonderful because, well, it's a strange word to use maybe in this context. But as I got deeper and deeper into this project, I was just astonished how many different kinds of materials you can find about infanticide. So there are policy proposals that villages might send to their lord, with ideas of how to combat infanticide. Mm. to respond to a surveillance policy that tried to stamp out infanticide. But there are more unexpected things too, like poems about stealer for murdered silkworms in regions where people kill infants without a second thought, according to the author of the poem, or the dialogue between a louse and the giant bird Pung of the East Asian bestiary whose wingspan is a thousand leagues. They talk about infanticide, they talk about nothing but infanticide. And then finally there is a rich visual record as well, and to track down that record has perhaps been the most adventurous, exciting part of the research process, because a lot of these materials are rather large wooden boards that are painted with an infanticide scene, and the murderous mother then, Chun-Liang, is also the most important piece of the film. and the murderous mother then, Chun-Liang, is also the most important piece of the film. Chun-Liang, is also the most important piece of the film. and i And\ufffd white Maybe vari ind returning to a determinatic start is a real Shield. Were you able to visit on those days and have access to that information? With the help of many people I was. I also get a sense of how the descendants of people in these areas who are now in charge of those chapels think about those artifacts and think about the history of infanticide. One of the most wonderful things was that I found this one local employee of a prefectural museum. I went there because I knew that they in their storage had one infanticide tablet. He said, why don't you come back in three or four days? I'll get the museum car and then I'll drive you to all the places you want to be driven in my prefecture. So I gave him the list of sites I wanted to visit. He made all the phone calls, he got the car and I had these delightful four days with this very generous man tracking down these images that in many cases you can't find anywhere in the published record. Now in sitting here listening to you, the thought strikes me particularly when you look at the written registries. Were the deaths tracked or was it just births? So in other words, did they just pretend that the death never happened? How does that work? That's a very astute question. There's not a whole lot of direct evidence for infanticide. So we have one diary of a person. We have a man who mentions that he kills his own children in three cases and a couple of other documents where people admit that they themselves are practicing infanticide. But on the whole, we have the complaints of people who think that infanticide is a problem or the sort of rather feeble excuses of people who think that it's not a problem. And then we have the patterns of the demographic record and to respond more directly to your question. The population registers of the. So the population registers of the children who are born in April, it would also be in March of the next year. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we actually literally track births with a couple of exceptions and we don't see these early childhood deaths. So part of my methodology was to back project the population. And there's been a lot of good work that allows us to estimate the unintended infant mortality rates with a lot of confidence. They're right around 15, 20%. And so if you find 10 children in the record, this means that you should assume that originally there were 12 or 13 children, I mean, put very crudely. And so really the victims of infanticide are these absences that we have to track down in the record. I see. And they're visible in all sorts of patterns, patterns that depend on the gender of the child, for example, but also the timing of the birth. I see. And then just in the implausibly low number of children that people say they've given birth to. And we're talking two or three children when under the kind of conditions of life and contraceptive technology and so on that people had at the time, it's hard to imagine that people would have had fewer than six or seven children without the practice of infanticide. You speak of three different cultures of infanticide. Mm-hmm. One of them is Japan. Let's talk a little bit about that. So I think one good way to visualize those different cultures is to look at two encounters that happened in highway inns in Japan in the early 18th century. One of them was between, one of them involved a pilgrim from a part of southern Shikoku who was going to the great shrine of Itsukushima, which I noticed is part of the clip that you play at the beginning of these interviews. It's this little postcard picture of a shrine gate in the water. I guess the one image that represents Japan most directly in this clip. He stays at an inn. All of a sudden, another guest rushes out. There's a big commotion. And he turns to another lodger at the inn and asks, what's going on? Has somebody discovered that there are robbers among the travelers? And he says, no, actually we discovered that there is a man from southern Shikoku. Oh, really? That's what happened? He says, no, absolutely not. And so we're just around the community. We're just lost. You know, and those local Chinese people are going bright and rare, but there are more people who are left behind. To me it's a bit like your picture is that you alte was just a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043alimactic, and a very partial figure that was doing good things, and then in the cellar, the sh GoPro elevator came up and said you know what? He was Tele visa is to locking down Butch elemento what the hell are you talking about? And that sort of says like this, who the hell, what the hell did you do? All these. companies are gentle. And they will tell him he's a holy god. ask me that question as to whether or not we wanted r talking about like, oh, how could say, well, we are from a part of Japan where such a thing could never happen. Now, when a woman is pregnant from an adulterous affair, she might seek the assistance of an abortionist. But the abortionists are so frowned upon by the population that even little children know that you can't even point at their houses because your fingers will rot off if you do, and we only suffer them to live at the edges of the village, and so on and so forth. Okay, so that's encounter number one. Encounter number two happens at the other end of Japan in the east, right around the same time, so 1720. And you have a medicine peddler from a region of Japan that, again, is proud to raise every single child. And he stays at this inn in a part of Japan that is the byword for infanticide by this time, the northeast. And he sees that the innkeeper is carrying a child, and he says, well, you know, I'm trying to find a way to get you. And he says, well, you know, I'm trying to find a way to get you. And he says, well, you know, I'm trying to find a way to get you. So he's carrying out a newborn child into the garden, and he thinks that's odd and tags along. And when he notices that an infanticide is going to happen, he clings to his sleeves and eventually talks him into accepting a subsidy for buying milk in exchange for raising the child. Now, both of these are stories that are written down much later, and so there are no doubt lots of things that are going to happen. of embellishments. But they were plausible to people. And the reason they were plausible is that you had, broadly speaking, three different cultures of infanticide. One is the culture that I dedicate most of my book to, a culture that uses infanticide as the major form of family planning and uses it to an extent that results in depopulation, every generation being smaller than the one that preceded it. There is a second area where infanticide is still evident in the traces of the demographic record. But people don't talk much about it at the time. And it's not frequent enough to be the cause of major depopulation in those areas. And then there's the final third of the archipelago, where people make it part of their identity that they do not commit infanticide. Although if you start looking into their population registers, there are lots of funny things going on there, too. And it's pretty clear that infanticide was, to some extent, a crime. To some extent, practice there. But more importantly, they resulted to different ways of keeping their household size manageable. And a lot of those ways abhorred people who lived in the infanticidal areas. So for example, they involved selling six, seven-year-old daughters into prostitution. And so the people in the infanticidal lands would say, you people are just like dogs and cats. How can you just sell your children as though they were animals? We are the true humans. We raise our children well, and sure enough, we have to discard some of our kids to do so. But it's more important to raise the chosen children well than to afflict all children that will come with a life of poverty and hunger and cold and bondage in many cases. Okay, so is it primarily a geographic difference where these beliefs were different? Would that be true? And then I guess it strikes me as, in terms of what you just said, the chosen child, how were these children chosen? And then the other awful thing is who would be the one to kill the child? Lots of great questions. Let's see how I can do this without launching into a long, long discussion. I'm going to do a long monologue. The geographical divisions were clearly present in people's minds in the 18th century. The 18th century is kind of the heyday of this culture of infanticide. On the ground, things were more complicated, and of course there were disagreements. Some people living in areas where infanticide was very common didn't think it was a good idea, but village communities were fairly tight-knit. And if there was a poor family... ...that raised a fourth or fifth child, the neighbors would come knocking at the door and ask, what are you doing? What kind of unreasonable behavior is this? You'll drive your household into ruin, you're not doing right by your own children, and by the way, you'll be a welfare case for the rest of the village. So why don't you rethink this pregnancy? And that's a major factor for creating this geographical unity. The other thing is that people's attitudes to a lot of important issues, including... Sure. ...a lot of important issues, including the fact that the population is not the same. The population is not the same. The population is not the same. The population is not the same. The population is not the same. The population is not the same. They're completely different. I actually find that in art and in movies. Well, I didn't think as much about this, but I found that when I was talking with this group today, it Institutions and Friedrichell and other oversight groups have been... So people are scared right now, through this plan which was called The Q Wave and they're So people are scared right now, through this plan which was called The Q Wave and they're asking where the Russians were from, toados or residents of a city and what's white when they asked, \u00a1de\ub300ilegible \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b! \u00a1de course, Ela y supone que ciertas! \u00a1verdad! who think that infanticide is a good idea will depend Nobody says nothing. really depend anybody. forver gleichen ideas like that. And especially in an 18th-century society, interactions are very much spatially bound. And they really open up in the 19th century, when especially local elites and the warrior governments that ultimately administer the villages begin to think that infanticide is a huge political, social, economic problem. And then it's a question, how do these sort of pioneers of the new view of infant life being sacred convey that to the, in their view, benighted parts of the population? You also asked how people selected. Right. Does it matter if it was a boy or a girl? I mean, did maybe the number matter? They went even odd, even odd. I have no idea. And then who was the one to take care of that terrible task? And how? So infanticide is quite common in the ethnographic and historical record, once you care to look. And a lot of people know that in places like China or India, it really tended to target women or that's at least the impression you get from reading the documents, the contemporary accounts. In Japan, it was more complicated. If you were a girl, you were at a slightly higher risk of falling victim to your parents' unwillingness to raise you. But I think that's a very important thing. I think that one very typical pattern that we see very, very strongly in the demographic record is that your chances of being accepted by your parents depend on how many children of the same gender already exist in the household.",
