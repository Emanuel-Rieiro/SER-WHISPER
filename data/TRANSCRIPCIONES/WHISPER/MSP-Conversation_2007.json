    "text": " How did your own experience as a TFA Corps member affect your beliefs about education? So as you said, Marty, I was a 1988 Corps member and I taught in Phoenix. And, you know, that question in my mind brings up three clear moments for me that really had an impact. The first was my very first day of teaching right out of college. I had 36 first graders walk into my door. I had 30 desks. I had no books and I had no curriculum. And I quickly came to realize that my kids had no letter recognition and they were part of a bilingual system that truly had no coherence or vision throughout my elementary school. And my school just lacked the basics of what you would expect any child to have that is attending any school. You know, a rigorous curriculum, a clear vision, a conducive learning environment and so forth. That's one story. The second sort of image that comes into my mind is one of my students, Jasmine, had these chronic headaches. And for a while I thought maybe she just, you know, was trying to get out of work. But what I came to realize is that she had horrific tooth pain because she had a mouthful of cavities. And when I started to ask the rest of my kids about dental hygiene, hygiene practices, I came to realize, you know, my kids didn't practice, have the basics on dental hygiene or didn't have access to dental care. And that was the beginning of me becoming exposed to understanding that my kids are coming to school with so many unmet needs that are just basic needs that every child should have. And the third story I would say that has stuck with me and really shaped me was that I was, you know, your first year typical. I was a poor member. I was terrified to let my children down. And I was climbing a very steep learning curve. And so I worked very hard. I was that person that beat everyone to school except our janitor and would stay late. And this one afternoon in my first semester of teaching, a veteran teacher came into my classroom and she asked, you know, as we were chatting, she asked me why I worked so hard. Because she wanted to know if I realized that we were teaching the future prisoners of the state of Arizona. Which was incredibly shocking and obviously disturbing. But really just deepened my own courage of conviction because that was the backdrop. But what I found is that my children consistently just would rise to the occasion. They were excellent. Of course, they had the ability to do just what any other kid could have. They just hadn't had the exposure opportunity. And then I came to realize, like, there are just so many barriers here that need to be overcome in terms of support. And so I was really trying to get my kids to get their unmet needs met. And then, of course, doing all the work that must be done in the schools and education and in my own classroom. But through it all, as I got to know my students and family, I mean, they're just hardworking folks who are my parents are trying to do what's best for their kids. And sometimes needed a little extra support to know how to best support their kids. But overall, you just saw this context where everyone just wanted to accept it. So I was really excited. I wanted to excel. And so I emerged from my experience really just inspired by my students and my family. I was pretty outraged about what was happening and how much of a child's access or opportunity is just driven by where she or she or he happens to be born and where he or she happens to go to school. And I think I started to just better understand the complexity of the problem that things happening outside of school in communities. You know, where children are living in poverty and what that means inside of classrooms and whole schools and districts. And what, you know, the beginning of what it might take to do something about this and really committed to being part of the solution and really committed and determined to get to the day when when truly every child does have access to a great opportunity. And then introducing our conversation. I noted TFA's two pronged theory of change that aims to address the problem. And I think that's what I was really excited about. And I think that's what I was really excited about. But that's an energy I've learned from our discussion. But that's an energy I've learned from our discussion. And to address those challenges that you saw firsthand during your time in Phoenix, both through its core members time teaching and through their subsequent leadership inside and outside of the sector as CEO, how do you see those two avenues of impact? And is one more important than the other? I would say that both are critical, they're interconnected and I would say one depends on the other. And so what I mean by that is. Yeah. But it's an energy that is so critical. Our first promise at Teach for America is to our children. And so we bring folks into classrooms, and so we have to deliver for them, and we have to ensure that we are providing the kind of education that our children deserve. And it is through that teaching and doing whatever it's going to take to ensure kids get what they need that your leadership skills are developed, that you start to learn a lot about yourself and what's required and understanding the systemic nature of the problem. I often say that the classroom is just a microcosm of all the inequities that, you know, play out. And the job of the teacher is to make sure you get it done for kids while processing this experience and starting to, for yourself, figure out, you know, what is my theory on, you know, the root causes and the solutions that I might pursue. But the whole idea here, is that whether you decide to stay in the classroom, become a principal or become an elected official, go off to be, you know, a doctor or a lawyer, that you're very consciously contributing to working towards, you know, this effort for equity and excellence for all kids. And that is what, you know, the over 60,000 network we have is getting up with the objective to ensure that we're working toward that end every day. Now, the article we're discussing studies how the experience, of participating in TFA affects alumni's views. Can you tell us just a bit about what participation entails? What experiences all core members share and the kinds of settings in which they teach? Sure. So every participant that joins us, I would say just from a, like, a very basic level, has a certain belief, which is that we believe that talent and smarts are distributed equally across all lines of difference. But the opportunity to meet that potential is not always there. And so you join Teach for America because you're committed to being part of the solution. You're committed to joining the network of leaders who are working alongside many others to drive real change. And our theory is that you need to get, you know, folks really proximate to the problem, so that the problem becomes personal and raw and really propels you to do something about this for life. It builds conviction. It builds courage and, you know, the will to do the hard stuff that's required in order to make real change. And so we've seen over and over again that getting folks in the middle of this changes hearts and minds. It leads to a lifetime commitment of working towards equity and excellence for all kids. And you come to understand again the systemic barrier that our children are up against. And you realize that progress actually really can be made. It can be made at the individual level. But the long-term sustained enduring progress needs to be, you know, at the systems level. And so all of our core members are placed in the classroom. They teach in urban and rural communities that are, you know, that serve low-income communities and predominantly students of color. They all go through a six to seven-week training that are run either regionally or nationally. And they all, when they enter the classroom, they all have a set of supports. And so we have a set of supports that we have in every community that is actively supporting our teachers to be great for kids in the classroom, but also nurturing the community of, you know, the core that they're a part of and working towards this change together. So let's turn to the article's findings. The authors, Katherine Kahn, Virginia Loveson, and Cecilia Moe, first examined a series of questions about the sources of educational inequity in the United States. And they conclude, I'll quote them. They conclude, I'll quote them. They conclude, I'll quote them. They conclude, I'll quote them. They conclude, I'll quote them. So for example, they're less likely to agree that poor families don't value education as much as richer families, and more likely to agree that systematic injustices perpetuate inequity throughout society. Why do you think that's the case? Why do you think that's the case? I don't know. I mean, I would say very simply because that is what you see. You know, you see it for yourself. We actually see this playing out with real people in real classrooms, with children and families. And so you really get in the middle of it. Again, this proximity brings insights and understanding of the complex nature of the problem, but also, like, you know, what are the root causes? And, you know, I've never met a core member. I've never met a core member that, you know, would say at the end of two years that, you know, our families don't care about their kids' education. Or, you know, you just more deeply understand all that's at play, which is the power of getting right in the middle of it. And then a second set of questions explores TFA alum's views of prominent education reforms. And here there were a few surprises, at least to me. I was struck by the fact that TFA participants were 15 percentage points less than their peers. Less likely to support the expansion of high quality charter schools, despite the fact that many of them had taught in those settings. TFA participants were also less likely to see a need to reduce dependence on standardized testing in American schools. And despite allegations that TFA is some kind of a union busting organization, TFA participation had no impact on participants' views of collective bargaining. What do you make of those findings? Well, you know, I must say, Marty, I'm not surprised by the findings. So I understand that some folks might be, because I do think there's this impression that everyone in the Teach for America network comes to the same conclusions about the solutions that we ought to be pursuing. And in fact, you know, I would say the thing that we have in common is that we deeply care about public schools. We deeply care about our children. We deeply care about ensuring every child truly has, you know, educational excellence and equity and this unwavering belief in the potential of our kids. And so it's hard to tell, I think, the average alum that things aren't possible or there's just not a way forward. But beyond that, I do really, my experience is that in terms of what are the pathways forward for progress and solutions, they really do vary. And I think they vary because the work is so low. But I think that the work is so high. And so I think that the work is so high. And so I think that the work is so high. And, you know, I think people root themselves in their communities, obviously, and they find that there are different ways forward. And you realize that, you know, the solutions are in the community and they must be co-created by the community. And so folks, you know, come to different conclusions. I mean, if we just take the charter findings, they do show that TFA folks are right in the middle. They're neutral on charters. And the reason it's not surprising to me is because, you know, I'm a TFA student. You know, we're in over 50 different communities. And the regions are different, how folks articulate what the needs are and how folks are trying to advance, you know, the work and what the vision is for the community. And children are different. And so how they come at it varies. And in some of our communities, there's, you know, a lot of excellent public, you know, high-quality district schools and charter schools. Some have more charter schools than district schools. And I think that really does. It does shape how our folks think about the work. And, you know, I, of course, you know, in the paper, it also talks about how our TFA alum are responsible for founding some of the most successful and highest impact charter schools in the country, like KIPP and IDEA and YES Prep. And more of which, you know, I believe have played such a critical role in showing us what's possible, you know, and putting children on fundamentally different trajectories that are coming from different places. Right. Right. And I think that's a really important thing to think about. And I think that's a really important thing to think about. And I think that's a really important thing to think about. And I personally witnessed this because I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley where IDEA has been operating for over 20 years and it's been incredible. But I just think at the end of the day, folks are rooted in their community and, you know, taking their lessons learned and applying them in different ways. And when it comes down to any particular policy question, I think just getting rooted in the context and the vision and, you know, what the community is co-creating is where the solution is. The solutions come, which end up varying region by region. And then a final set of items reveals that the TFA experience doesn't make core members more cynical or pessimistic about the challenge of improving education. In fact, alums are more likely than non-participants to agree that it's possible for all children to attain an excellent education and less likely to agree that there's only so much teachers can do to help low-income students succeed. That result must be gratifying. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. and then doubling down and realizing that there has to be a path forward and being part of challenging the status quo and creating different realities is our mandate. And our kids show us why that's needed. And it's sort of you can't look, you know, when you see something you can't look at and you stick with it and do whatever you can to ensure that you do your part to contribute to the end of ensuring all kids get what they deserve.",
