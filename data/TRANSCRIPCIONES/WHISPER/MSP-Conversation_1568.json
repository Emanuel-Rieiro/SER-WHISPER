    "text": " 15 minutes to 10 and Zonke joins me from our Jubek studios. Good morning, Zonke. Morning, KG. How are you? You can hear it in my voice. Was it a bit of a rough night? Oh, no, no. I never have rough nights. Because you don't drink and you don't smoke. No, I don't. Exactly. No, I slept a bit too late, hanging out with a very, very naughty girlfriend of mine. And so, yeah, we slept very late. But then again, yeah, no, it was not a rough night. Okay, not in those terms. Not in that sense. But I know that I was told once by Brahu that asking musicians to be anywhere before 10 o'clock is really a really big ask because they just simply don't know when they're going to stop. You could have been recording all night. True, but with me, you know, I could have been recording, you know, all night, but I'd still be up at 6 o'clock in the morning. Well, you do have two young children, don't you? Yes. Tell me about your babies. Oh, my goodness. The other one is a big girl and she's about to get a job. How old is she? The older one? She's 11. Okay. Yes. And my one-year-old son. And what's the, you know, what's it like to be a mom? Gosh, it's, it's, I can't describe it. I can, I don't want to sound cheesy, but anybody who's a mom out there. Go ahead. No, seriously. I mean, with moms, you know, your kids are the best. You know, your kids are just. Most cute, adorable. You know, they say the smartest things and you want to call everyone. And it was like, okay, my son does the same thing. Duh. So you don't want to be that person. I have to watch myself so that I don't go on and on and on about my own kids. Thank you very much for being vigilant about that. Because some friends do go on and then you feel so bad that you're not encouraging them. But Zonke, you, did you have much of a choice really to get into music since it seems like your entire family, is, was, or is somehow still involved in music? I didn't have much of a choice. I'm not sure if I cared to. Music was just a normal, normal thing to me. I thought everybody's household was like that, where their father's just playing around, making noise while everybody's still sleeping, you know, rehearsing on his drums. Right. Or having friends over, you know, wasting our food and making breakfast for friends that we didn't know were coming to rehearse. Right. Um, so, um, yeah. No, it was just normal. I, even though my mom had, you know, had, um, was in a different field, to me that was never an option. Right. You know, um, cause we're already singing around the house with my sisters and I, and I swore I could sing even from a young age. Whether I could, could not at the time is another story. All right. You know, yeah. You, one of your, um, um, your big breaks was when you were singing, when you met the German group, uh, Jazz Cantina. Yes. Of which you're actually still a part. Who are Jazz Cantina? Jazz Cantina. Uh, is made up of all these jazz musicians, uh, Germans. And then one of them, uh, happened to be working on a project, um, where he was just, you know, you know how people went in their studios, you know, they'll just do songs hoping that they'll find a voice or have some amazing worldwide, or, or project that would be a worldwide hit. Right. So, but they were in South Africa and they were, you know, invited here to play cultural exchange program. And my, um, my manager at the time. You know, just happened to go see these guys that were from Germany and he loved the sound and he knew that it was the kind of sound that I liked, you know, cause it, it was more like British soul. Right. And, uh, he called me and says, I went to see this band. I'm sure you would like them. I told them about you. And, um, I thought it was one of those things like, oh, okay, whatever. We'll see what happens here. And, you know, after the, you know, when they, when they went back to Germany, they contacted him again and sent the music. And when he called me into studio to listen to the songs, I absolutely fell in love with the sound. And, um, I wrote a song, Africa, my motherland. We sent it back to them. They loved it. There were parts where they felt, uh, maybe we were using inferior equipment, recording equipment because of the clicks, you know, in closer. And that was, that was so strange. You know, I don't know if I felt a bit offended, but at the same time it was kind of cute. You know? Yes. I think I would be very offended. Yes. I was a bit of fun. I was like, oh, but then again, they don't know that we have all these languages here. Okay. They're forgiven, you know? Right. And like, but when they found out that, no, those are clicks, you know, it's part of a language. It's called Corsa. It's a tribe here. Right. You know, you know, they were, they were very happy and they were like, oh, you know, we want more of this stuff. And I was like, okay, fine. Then I shouldn't be offended. Sure. Yeah. If it brings in more work. Exactly. Yeah. So that's how, uh, Culture Clan was born. You know, they, they came here with their film crew that w you know, with, uh, uh, superior recording material. Right. Equipment. And, uh, we recorded some more songs. I wrote some more songs. Uh, I called two friends of mine who are rappers also from the Eastern Cape who are going to Vertz at the time. And Culture Clan came out of that, you know, and then they later offered me my solo project, which was Solitary, but it was only released in, in, in, in Germany, Italy, Amsterdam and Japan. Okay. And then, yeah, but it was time to, you know, I really wanted to be somebody at home. Right. You know, hence the return. And, and me and my sister Lulu, you know, kind of like looking around and, and she decided, okay, you know what, she's going to go to Kalawa because she's always loved the Kalawa sound. Right. So I joined Lulu, you know, in her meeting with Oskiido and Bruce, and that's the meeting where they kept referring to us both as a duo. And I was like, whoa, we're not here for me. We're here for Lulu. Right. Like, no, no, but you guys are like, no, no, I'm not looking for a deal. I've got an album Solitary and I'm trying to get it released in South Africa. Can you help me or not? Right. But they were not hearing me. They didn't care about that. They just wanted us to do something together. But that never worked. But, you know, I ended up signing the contract with Kalawa Jasmine because I ended up being the one, you know, way too eager to, to be in studio. Right. You know, and do whatever I could. And Lulu had a full time job at the time. So, yeah. And that's amazing that your sister also, Lulu, is, you know, so holds her own. And I find that you were only seen kind of like as a duo. But I think that you're also, you know, you're a very, I see you as very, very different. Even your sounds are different. You know, I would for a long time, you know, I would try and hold my tongue and not sing Lulu's praises. Right. But that woman's voice, I have never heard anything like that in this country or whatever. Sure. You know, she's my sister, but I'm sorry, she's got an amazing voice. She's an artist. You guys remind me of the Williams sisters because they're so prolific at what you do. Thank you. Now, Ms. Zonke, something that you very... passionate about is songwriting. Yes. Right. Like you insist on actually like really cultivating and nurturing that part of your career. And there's not, I don't see a lot of women, or maybe I'm not looking in the right places. A lot of women artists really encouraging that part of their career. What gives you that confidence to write more? You know, I never really used to be confident in my songwriting. As a matter of fact. Yeah. Growing up, I had a lot of songs. When everybody was writing, you know, Mariah Carey's lyrics and every... I was writing my own. Right. You know, hiding them. And I remember my sister Lulu found my book and I had written my own song. And it was some stupid thing, man. Like, baby, let's rock and rock until we can do it no more. Something like that. Come on, baby. And she was like, oh my goodness, is this the kind of stuff you write? I'm going to show my mom. I was so embarrassed, you know? Right. Because she felt like, oh, I'm going to show my mom. She felt like I was too... Even for me to say baby in my song was a little too much for my sister to bear. You know? So I had to bribe her to hide that song from my mom because I had a lot of babies. And she was like, this is my little sister. Why is she talking about baby, baby, this in her song? What does she know that you shouldn't be knowing by now? You know, but so, you know, I kind of like put it on hold. I was like, man, I didn't think it was all that. And then eventually, you know, I think when... I met Culture Clan, you know, I started writing my own songs in English in Xhosa. And I was like, oh my goodness, okay, this doesn't sound half bad. You know, they were loving it. You know, a lot of people loving it. And I thought, okay, maybe I should just carry on doing this, you know? Yeah. Well, I mean, I ask you that question because so many times people tell other people to stay in your lane, so to speak. And I only say, what does that mean? I don't want, I don't have a lane. So stop telling me what I should do. I should be driving and I'm not staying. I stay in my lane. I don't mind somebody telling me that because I tell myself to stay in my lane, you know? And your lane can be what you define as a lane. Yes, exactly. You know, my lane, I just, I'm just looking at this tar in front of me, if you're looking at it in that sense. And I'm running my own race and I'm not looking at anybody else. And this is how I feel I should write my songs. This is how I feel I should, you know, project my voice. This is how I feel I want to get my message across. I'm not looking at anybody else. And I think that's important because people recognize that, that you're not just out there, you know, to fit in and looking at what somebody else has already done and be like, okay, I want to do that. Why do that when it's been done already? Right. You know, so that's me staying in my lane. You know, I'm not really, really looking at what anybody else is doing. But because also it's a very profitable lane. If someone like Dolly Parton makes the vast majority of her income from being the publisher, that's what people don't understand. Yes. Because if you're a music artist, you get to perform that song, you can make it famous, you'll get those royalties for performing it. But actually, Kanene, Ching Ching is coming from the publishing. It is a very profitable lane. But at the same time, even if it wasn't, music is meant to be shared. Hence, I write songs for other people. Sure. You know, it's meant to be shared. And I wouldn't want to, you know, if people say to me, oh, you write so well, you know, can you write me a song? And I'd be like, oh, no, no, I'm not going to do that. You know, these are my songs. I'm not that kind of person. You know, I share music. And as much as I stay in my lane, I'd like to see, you know, other people progressing in their own lanes. Okay. You know, and doing well. I don't want to be the only reigning queen of songwriting or whatever. I don't want that. Yeah. You know, I don't want to be sitting on top of some mountain while everybody's like, you know, sitting on hills. We must all be on the mountain. And a prolific songwriter that you are because you've written hits for the likes of Mafi Gizolo, Don Laka, Black Coffee, and Winnie Kumalo. You know, amongst others.",
