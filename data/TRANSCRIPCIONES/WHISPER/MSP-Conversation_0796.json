    "text": " Hello, welcome to GPFace. We're going to be talking about worldwide media coverage today with Leila Nacharwati, who's based in Spain right now, and she's the co-founder of Syria Untold, an organization that aims to depict the non-violent movement in Syria. And Amira Al-Hassani, our MENA editor, along with Solana Larson, our managing editor, and Ellery Biddle, our advocacy editor. Leila, I'd like to start with you. What is happening right now in Syria, and how is it so different from what's being covered in mainstream media, and what's the mission of Syria Untold? Well, what happens is that what concerns people on a daily basis... is far from the geopolitical conversation that is actually more and more deafening, and tends to ignore Syrians on the ground, tends to ignore so many different forms of daily resistance, and focus only on proxy wars. And I think this has to do with Syria being a black hole for so long that most people do not understand the Syrian internal dynamics. Therefore, it is easier to... apply geostrategic filters than to try to understand what's happening inside the country, the social fabric, the economic, political, and sociological issues are difficult to understand. And again, it's easier to just apply the world in two blocks clash of civilizations to the Syrian context than to try to understand why did Syrians take to the streets in the first place, and how this movement has evolved, and in many ways, been kidnapped by external forces trying to impose their own agendas. So let's rewind back a bit to before the conflict started, before the revolution started. In a recent interview, you said that there's no more silence, everything is out in the open now. So could you explain how things were different before the revolution, and how things are now within Syria? Yes. Like I always say, Syria was probably one of the few countries where people spoke about anything related to the functioning, not necessarily politics, but the functioning of the country in whispers. And I'm talking about people, even those who grew up out of the country. So I think only in very extreme cases, like maybe North Korea, or like Syria was, you get this very closed context where nothing is out, where you don't hear about what's happening, because every other country in the region, more or less, you heard, I don't think the taboo around what was happening inside, and the isolation of citizens from the outer world was so extreme as it was with Syria, which is also not such a touristic country, most people were not familiar with the Syrian context. Journalists could not enter the country without like an official guided tour, which means going to where the regime showed them. So this has created a void where most Syrians inside and out of the country were silent, me included. So I only started writing about Syria two and something years ago. And this is very different, because at least now everything is out in the open, at least now we can express ourselves. And I think if the so-called Arab Spring has succeeded in one thing, it's the amount of voices that are out there, and they were completely repressed and silent until a few years ago. I'd like for Amira to jump in now. Amira, how has media coverage within the MENA region changed for Syria? In the West, for example, Bashar al-Assad was seen as a very liberal leader, before the revolution, and now his identity, at least in the US media, has been completely transformed. How is it within other Middle Eastern countries and in North Africa? More or less they're following the US suit in this matter. But online we see a different conversation. Online there are different voices. The situation with Syria was, as Dana was saying, it was like a dark hole. We didn't know what was going on. We knew there was repression. We know that dissent is not tolerated. We know all these things, because as Arabs, it varies from one country to the other, but the main ingredients are all the same. The situation with Syria was when it started. It was even a few days before it started. The doggers we were talking to were, telling us there is nothing happening, there won't be anything. And then when the protests first started, we were taken aback like everything else that has happened. And the media coverage is, like, they're focusing on, again, the big battles and what's happening on the ground, but the human stories and how people feel and what's happening to individuals or villages, or, you know, people. And that's the story that we're missing. We know that right now different factions are fighting each other, but we don't see a human face to that. We don't know how people are living. And it's sites like Syria Untold and the voices of bloggers on the ground that are bringing this human suffering to the forefront. So, I think that's a big thing that we're missing. Right. And Leila, would you like to jump in and explain to us a bit about how it is being in Spain right now and seeing coverage about Syria in Spain? Yeah. I think it's one of the worst coverages in the world, actually, at least from the ones and the reports that I read on a daily basis from different countries. Spain is probably among the worst. Maybe because of the financial crisis that has been accompanied by media investing less and less in sending journalists to the ground. So, they don't. They don't send journalists to the ground. So, it's mainly freelancers going on their own behalf, risking their lives, getting paid very, extremely little for their very important reports and pieces. And then I think Spain falls into the same trap that most media fall into, which is magnifying anything that sounds Islamist, jihadist. This somehow is very attractive, and I still don't understand why, for certain media, anything that has to do with... A colleague was sending me yesterday a report on sexual jihad. And this is a colleague who hasn't written about Syria and any other aspect. For, like, months. So, the one piece he writes about Syria is about sexual jihad. So, if we only... I mean, I don't doubt that these stories in the very chaotic context that is Syria now, a lot of these stories are going to come up. But I don't think it is responsible to provide these stories when every other aspect that has to do with internal dynamics is actually being ignored. And the whole focus... The whole focus is on militarization, geopolitical issues, and anything that has to do with the fear of Islamism and jihadism. So, I always encourage people to listen to geostrategic experts who write from their couches a little less, and listen to citizen voices on the ground a little more. And I think projects like Global Voices Online, where everybody who writes, or most of us who write, are very in close contact with the internal dynamics and the daily stories. And this is also what I would like to contribute with, with Syria Untold. The stories of people on the ground, how they see their reality, and how they're telling their own stories in first person. And there's here a question by Ivan. You think that stories of a conflict based on militarization and Islam provoke or further the conflict? Exactly. So, this colleague of mine was telling me, this is part of the reality, and we have to see it too. But I don't think it's as much part of the reality, because they're isolating it from any other aspect. And if you are missing the context, you're not letting people understand how Syria is, and why it is what it is right now. And I don't think information without this context, that it provides an understanding and a frame of how to understand what's happening, is useful. I think the contrary. I think it backfires. I think it further emphasizes, the view of the other, which is in case Arabs, in the eyes of their neighbors, in the eyes of Western media, as these people who have a natural tendency to fight without a reason. And there are reasons, and there are internal dynamics, and you need to understand them, in order to understand the evolution of what's happening on the ground. If there was one story from Syria that you wish people knew, what would it be? There are endless stories, but I think we need to put the focus on the story, and focus on the attempts of self-management and self-government. Because amid the huge destruction, there are people trying to rebuild schools, trying to rebuild hospitals, trying to create art and music, trying to create theater for children. And imagine the stress that these people face, the very little resources. So when people ask me, what can we do to help? Well, these people on the ground, these local coordination committees, these groups are very well organized. You can find them all on Syria Untold. You can find the list with the campaigns on the ground, the grassroots groups working on the ground, the Syrian artists and creators that are trying to make a difference on the ground. So any support, economic, but not only, because the most important thing is legitimacy. These people are being alienated because they're surrounded by violence, not only from the regime, but by others trying to benefit from the chaos on the ground. All forms of extremism are now struggling to get enough of the Syrian revolution. So it's very important that we focus on these people so that they're not alienated and isolated, because their work is actually building the Syria that Syrians took to the street for in March 2011.",
