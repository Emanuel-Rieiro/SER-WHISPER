    "text": " have you seen moonlight of course i've seen moonlight moonlight's beautiful yeah so and the thing that i like most about that is it's like yeah it's about a gay relationship but it's not it's not i i was like waiting for the day that that he was gonna get beaten up because he's gay he's never beaten up because he was gay he was just beaten up because spoiler for anyone that's not seen it yet sorry guys but he was but he was it was just it was just a love story and that's what it was it was also it'd be i was waiting for it to be like typically like a black community but it was never it was just it was just a love story in a black community and that was it and that's what i think is i know that your um monologue is about coming out and the difficulty of coming out but it's still because it's romantic and because it is the most romantic of the the group yeah it makes it it normalizes yeah i don't want to make this a moonlight review but like especially towards the end as well sorry no but towards the end i don't know the actor's name you know yeah which one the main guy yeah yeah i don't know his name but he looks a lot like 50 70s in that and you know what i'm just like i just i'm like you know what like this is this is awesome because it's it's it's taken like the the the stereotypical face and unfortunately this is unfortunate but like the way we see gay men um and the stereotypes around that and it's just flipping it on its head and like there's this guy that you probably are quite an alpha male like a man that you probably like would imagine seeing in like you know like a completely different genre of film and he's this especially when he's you know in that one scene and he's talking to this guy and he's like you're the first guy that i've ever slept with and he's so vulnerable and he's like i'm not gonna lie to you i'm not gonna lie to you i'm not gonna lie to you and i'm not and it's he's so vulnerable and you're like wow like this is this is what we needed do you know what i mean that film just like broke so many barriers and it's amazing go see it it definitely happens like it's not like that there's probably like so many people out there it's like oh my god that is my that is my story that is so me yeah and it's like we need more things like that of people like just maybe just stereotypes flipped on the head do you feel self-conscious or did you feel self-conscious when you started this and do you still feel so still feel self-conscious kind of talk not necessarily talking about sex like uh in like a social situation but do you feel self-conscious like talking about the fact that you are talking about do you know what i mean go on um it's a i def i didn't feel self-conscious ever when we were talking about it just in the room because we said from the beginning this is a very safe space we're not gonna anything we say in this room stays in this room it was a um and i've i've known you guys for years i feel very comfortable with all of you yeah but then every and to be honest it wasn't even the prospect of talking about sex in front of strangers and doing this monologue in front of strangers it was the fact that my family i know you said that i was just like because even though it's not me i don't know it's just not the sort of conversations that we'd have and the way actually can i ask sorry i'm gonna i'm gonna be like i'm gonna flip roles now i'm gonna be like did did your parents ever like you know like um following seeing that show what did what did they say anything like what was it like there's nothing changed no they didn't know they they just they thought it was a really really good piece of writing and performed it well that's amazing has it changed their like their their thinking about that topic and like has it changed their mindset i need i need to get um it's about um it's about um it's a bartender uh just it starts off just talking about um the general things that she's noticed working in a bar um the sort of differences between men and women and the way that they act and the sort of i don't want to say predatory but that sort of approach that men have on a night out to women and it's it's probably an unfair perception she makes a lot of bold statements about this is what this is what all men do this is what all women women do and it's not true necessarily but that's her view of it and then as it goes on it gets more into the personal experiences and the guys that she slept with and why she slept with them which is because she's very unhappy and depressed and just wants some sort of comfort and wants someone to validate yeah yeah it is it's validation um you bring up a really good point sorry to say you say you know what you were saying about um like it's her opinion it's her view people that come to this show i don't think they should ever think at any point that what we're saying is the the right or there is no right or wrong answer because this is like we're not trying to be politically correct or anything this is literally what we've written and this is what we feel person every single monologue is maybe except an exception to yours because someone else wrote yours georgia but an exception that it's very personal to us and it's what we've found and something that we feel passionate about if people tend to you know if you're a person who's not a person who's not a person who's not a person who's not like people might find like might have a different opinion and might disagree but the point is we're putting a perspective out there we're putting our opinions out there and you know take it or leave it like it's just a different it's a fresh i think it raises questions it does yeah but also like during like the whole that show that we did that show it literally in between our everyone's monologues at moments people laughed at things you'd said and it made you think like so it it didn't make well about the self-consciousness thing like when we're reading it and we're like well what if people don't agree with what we're saying like you just said then people laugh because people see see things the same way do you know what i mean and it was quite comforting to see that people were like oh yeah because that is kind of true that that has happened to me yeah familiarize with the audience i think that's why we had a connection straight away and especially like i think they all of the monologues start off quite um like on the surface and they're just sort of chatty and conversational and so people people are just like oh yeah i can relate to that and then that gives them the connection they need to then when you go into the more emotional stuff and it gets a bit harder they're then like they're invested and they're listening to you and they're thinking oh hang on i could relate to that and i yeah i don't know it gives you a connection with what you were saying about like about your opinion on boys like being predatory it's like but then it's still like it's in terms of like you know like gender like roles and expectations of boys like going out and shagging loads of birds and all that even if that's like obviously like there's not every boy has that opinion when they're going that out but a lot of boys are like oh yeah i don't know what to do with that in my head so i'm just like oh i don't know what to do with that and then the boys do and even if it's not how they actually not because actually you want to go out and have sex with girls but they're like societal expectations yeah it's not that culture isn't it okay so i'll just do it because everyone else wants me to so then other people will see them as like kind of like predatory yeah but even if but just because they're they're pressured to maybe go and actually do it yeah it's a domino effect role do you know what i mean because that's what they like we think men like like women will be like oh men see us as all like weak and vulnerable and everything like well they have in their head that women see them as like henchmen they have to be henchmen it's the same thing and i think that's the thing the barrier between men and women is because of the stereotype and we believe women have to have to like i quote stop well not quote do you know what i mean have to see men as being henchmen men have to see women as being like a fluffy cloud i don't know i mean even the amount of guys i've spoken to that i've that i've you know that i've spoken to and i'm really close to and it's all like i was saying before it's just an image like i know guys who are yet to come out because they feel so vulnerable and they feel like they can't speak to someone because they've grown up and they've they've you know i people that play rugby like i'm not i don't want to you know yeah yeah yeah he had kids and an ex-wife and he was like 40 yeah and because he was a rugby player he felt like he couldn't come out and then he didn't come out and he was like oh nothing's changed yeah i really hope that yeah exactly i really hope that's like a knock-on effect for other guys absolutely um so do you think this is a kind of going off tangent of what we're talking about but on your flyer or your poster it says um like you want to cut through like the instagram kind of bullshit yeah do you and people always like i overshare on instagram more so than i ever have before like i feel like instagram just like opened up the world off but like uh do you think that exposing yourself online and like being through social media is different to and obviously the answer is yes but how do you think it's different to exposing yourself on stage and and doing these monologues because well on facebook and twitter and instagram everything like i know plenty of people that live this fake life of oh my god look at me and and my husband oh my god look at me and my kids and it's like hang on a minute first time you see your kids all week or oh my god look what i did with my friends okay but then having that image because everyone's led to believe that's their life on social media because you don't actually see it but i think because we did it on stage and said not things we'd necessarily put on social media it was it was there we was we was with each other and i think again again the connection with the audience meant that we did strip back everything and it's an emotional experience that you can't replicate online or any social media yeah i think there is a common thread between both of them though because i always think the thing about um when we were coming up with that like sort of tagline uh the thing for me about instagram and facebook and twitter is that you're deciding what you're going to show and how much you're going to show and what perspective you're going to put on that um and it's not necessarily an accurate representation and with our monologues we were deciding how much we were going to say and what we were going to say and i know like bits that were actual you know experiences from our lives whether we were going to change them and how we were going to write that um and so they do both have that element of this is a this is what i want to show you about myself curated yeah um but we i think we did try with honestly to be completely honest and to just well i think like not pun intended i wrote the word like honestly and i was like i can't like the difference as well like with the monologues people are like oh my god i'm not going to show you my monologues people are like oh my god i'm not going to show you we've got we've been given all like this 15 minute whatever space just to talk and so we can't you're not going to be able to keep people captivated just by prattling on about all my life's so great 15 minutes like oh i've got to get chai latte it wouldn't do all this weird and we want it was about being honest transparency and we want people to actually feel like feel emotionally involved and actually come out of the come out of the theater whatever being like oh i do maybe want to go home i'm going to talk to my daughter and my son or whatever about some of this stuff you can see right through it yeah you can see right right now like yeah i'll be right through it if it's if it's um for 15 minutes if you're stood there and you're just talking like you know excuse the word but like are you allowed to swear on this yeah okay if you just stand there for 15 minutes and talk absolute bollocks the audience are going to see right through you yeah and that's why it was so important for rachel to make sure that what we wrote was genuine and was something that we could relate to and that's i think one of the you know the key highlight to the the show I think is just the amount of honesty that there is there and I will admit it is it is heightened at certain bits but that's just for dramatic effect and I mean as for it to be like a play like you're not going to just be stood there the whole time you know it's just very monotone very boring you have to heighten it just a bit to create an atmosphere. When we were writing and we were sort of coming back week on week with like a little bit more of it that we changed and I kept we kept I know me and Billy talked about this a lot I kept just getting really annoyed because every week I'd come back and Rachel would just be like give me more go deeper this is still on the surface I want to know more and it took I think it took me about two months before I finally got somewhere and she was like that's it you've got there. It's amazing to talk about and I just like I said this already but the fact that we've done that with Rachel I feel like Rachel is now like a relative of mine she's so close to her and I'm glad I've done it because you know it just feels like the natural pressure of having to do it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and I've worked with Rachel since I was maybe 12 now and I'm 18 now so it's been a long time and this show feels like the cherry on top like the natural progression and again what we want to do for this show as well is we want it to feel like you know as part of the TV workshop we have a younger group a middle group and then we have this members are like four yeah and the oldest are what 18 or something 23 so as you can imagine you start off doing these plays and then you do short films and we want Edinburgh Fringe and going to the Edinburgh to be like the you know the height like the neck like almost like not the graduation but you know like the pinnacle of what what we do at TV workshop so where we are setting like the preset for them yeah Rachel wanted us to sort of learn how to function as our own theatre company and not just have her organizing everything it's wonderful as she is organizing everything and to get that experience is just incredibly valuable we've been doing marketing yeah fundraising um all sorts it's really really exciting yeah and luckily with Rachel we have like all these connections that we wouldn't have had otherwise like in terms of Edinburgh like she knows the guy that like the space the space you came yeah the thing with Edinburgh is we literally were just sat there after lunch and we were like we don't this to Edinburgh yeah so anyone wouldn't have been to Edinburgh and then Rachel's face just lit up like I know someone I've done this before and we were all just like oh my god guys we're going to Edinburgh so it's like oh this would suit Edinburgh Fringe wouldn't it yeah it was like a day we were like okay Edinburgh Fringe okay we'll go we'll just go for it and do it we filmed the guy up and we was like okay we'll pay you tomorrow but no we have to we have to say it was really expensive so I'm really the the TV workshop is such a beautiful community because we're also supportive of each other the parents are it's a charity as well so the parents have been like donating and we've been doing fundraisers and social media and people have been just like you know like trying to get involved and engaging with us and it's just really it's just amazing to see really yeah okay um my final like uh feminist related question is Vagina Monologues came out like 21 years ago we mentioned this earlier but it's like an entirely different generation of women yeah it was before all of us were born yeah little do you know I'm 21. do you think um we talk about sexuality differently well I'm not even your generation I always think I'm like 16. do you think that we talk about sexuality differently because of things I think like social media yeah like I'm like I'm really open about that that's crazy because I do I do think though like you know when you think of the 60s and stuff and swinging 60s and I just I remember growing up and learning about that I just I just assumed that like after the 50s that was like a turning point in history and then you specifically in England well I wouldn't know anywhere else but like in England that was the turning point and since then everyone's just been like very open about sex you know like things films like Alfie you know is that the right film yeah like I feel like it was like a change in culture but although despite that that it's the act like the actual discussion side like because people were doing it we were having sex but talking about it there's a discussion side and actually making it like being aware of what we're actually doing that was what wasn't changing I think yeah education it's yeah education it's really interesting that you brought the 60s because I did actually just remember a conversation that me and my mum had when we were talking about the show um which was she just said like oh you couldn't even say the word vagina in my house when you were growing up like it just wasn't done you wouldn't you're just like wow you're just like why are you doing this. wasn't done you wouldn't bring it up like if you're on your period you wouldn't mention it nothing um and then so she was just like i think it's great i think it's great that you can you guys can do this and talk about it vagina the thing with such like as regards sexuality like are you gay you buy you straight or whatever else i think that i don't know it's become more of a i don't know it kind of blocks people off nowadays from i mean we go about and saying like you can you can be free you can have what you want you can have what relationship you want gay marriage and all this but you still get asked like what you are exactly but i'll tell you why that is though i do think that is because as of recently you know in the last decade or whatever and this has been this change in this generation because it's all happening all in all at once it is for some people a bit overwhelming but i think naturally over the next couple of years because it's becoming more natural and people not becoming more natural but it's people are learning more about it people are like okay like that it's almost been like a lesson for everyone you and people now fully understand what's going on well like i you know are starting to understand and then over the for example that in say 20 2015 or i feel like by that point that's people like okay we understand it now and it won't be so like there wouldn't be that negative connotations with all those words and you know especially when you see on facebook like there's 100 is it like 100 genders or like all these things yeah it's like the gender spectrum and things like that and now there's like lots of negative connotations but i'd like to think that in a couple of years when people are fully understanding that and sort of taking that in that that no longer no longer exists i mean i go to school and i mean people walk past not not to me but that's other people that are you gay or what you're doing you die not to me but you know to other people and it's like it still has that harshness in the yeah even if it doesn't mean like gay is like gay is bad so if i call you gay you are bad they just it it kind of things for some kids have come just like a word that comes like oh you're his best mate. One of my best mates is gay and he'll call, he'll like if I do something that he doesn't like he's like oh that's gay. Yeah. But he just, I think he's trying to like take it back. Yeah. Cause he's like it's fine I can say that. Take ownership of it. Yeah. Cause I am gay. It's weird. I don't know. So, when, can you tell me, do you know where it is in Edinburgh yet? It's the Royal Mile. The space on the Royal Mile. And that's what it's called in the States. The space UK. Yeah. And you're there the whole of August? No we're there from the 4th to the 12th of August. But we're not doing it on the 6th. And that's when we'll be out and about. Dressed as the Spice Girls. So if you see a guy dressed as Mel B and a bunch of girls dressed as Spice Girls, we want you to come and say hi to us and like enjoy Edinburgh together. And if you see a girl in a really small dress in a really cold Scotland that's me as Posh Spice and lots of people as stupid as I am. And... Where can people find like the TV Workshop to find out a bit more about it? Social media! Yes! Okay so the hashtag for the show is TVWSHonestly and that's on Twitter and I think on Facebook as well. So if you search that hopefully everything should come up. TV Workshop is just at TV Workshop Salford. And... We're on Facebook as Television Workshop Salford. We've also got an Indiegogo page to raise funds. And there's lots of exciting merchandise and stuff. Yeah you can, so it's not just, we're not saying like oh please give us some money. It's like we're not saying like oh please give us some money. It's like oh if you give us five pounds you can get like a picture of us. You get some dust, pictures of us dressed as a Spice Girl. Yeah we did like a photo shoot with, we did a photo shoot with Timeless Photography. Yeah Alan's, he's a brilliant, he's actually just won an award for photography as well. So we're like here we've got like a one-time award winning photographer taking our pictures. He's great, he's great honestly yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. Thanks for having us yeah.",
