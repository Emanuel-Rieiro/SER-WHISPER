    "text": " We want that American dream to be here for generations to come. So it doesn't matter where you were born or what status you were born in or what color or what sex you are. We want that opportunity to be available for everybody. Well, absolutely. Oh, I was just going to say, I have a son who's in high school, and I definitely want that American dream for him to be able to, you know, just seek whatever you want to do in life. And I worry that that's maybe not going to be the same. He's not going to have the same opportunities that I have in my age group. And that saddens me. Well, I think there is some real cause for optimism as well. You know, we go through and we try to present the issues, but there are a lot of solutions. And one of them is right under our noses. And in the Constitution, in the preamble, government is supposed to do some certain things. And what we need to do is we need to do some certain things. What we need to do is when we see an affront on these things, we need to push back. And we've talked a lot about the Constitution here, but I find that there's really six things. First of all, the Constitution was put in place to form a more perfect union. Then secondly, establish justice. And that's not social justice. That's not taking away from one person to give to another. Third is ensure domestic tranquility. We'll be talking about that today. Provide for the common defense. And that's just a no-brainer. People have to be safe in order for them to go after their dreams. Promote the general welfare. And we can talk about that on Ebola. When Jill called in, general welfare doesn't mean that we're going to go out again and take from one person to give to another. It means that we protect our people again so that they can go out and live their lives. And then lastly, and we were talking about this, we have a responsibility to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our children. And so we have the recipe. We have the opportunity, you guys, for what we need to do. And we've got a lot of fun callers that are going to be calling in. We'll be noodling this all around. Right, right. And I think the important thing for us is to continue paying attention and talking to our friends and our neighbors about what's going on. You know, I was walking with Americans for Prosperity this weekend and I went up to a door and one woman, she said, I'm sad. She's like, our health insurance prices went up. My father lost his and he's having to find new insurance and he's an older gentleman so it's kind of a pain for him. But I don't \u2013 what kind of pain? I don't know. What can I do? I'm one person. What can I do? And I think that the one thing that we can do is get everybody engaged and say join us in talking about the truth and sharing real-life stories. TV isn't always telling you the truth. But what we're going to do today is we're going to talk to some real-life people who have been affected by some of these poor policies that have been passed down. One of the newest ones I just saw last week came out that CU was one of many \u2013 one of let's say 111 colleges nationwide. Right. That is now limiting the hours that their students are allowed to work so that they are under that 30-hour limit so that they don't have to pay for their health insurance because of Obamacare. This Affordable Care Act is making midsize employers either lower the amount of people that they hire or lower the number of hours these people are allowed to work so that they don't have to pay for their health insurance. So it's like a tax on working full time. And I think it's pretty sad. It's sad to say. It's an attack on our young people and it's an attack on all Americans. What do you think, Francoise? Well, they always say people have good intentions but they don't look at necessarily the future of what their policies are going to do. And so they don't look at the unintended consequences. And I think that's what you're seeing with that particular case with the college students where they're having their hours cut because of a policy that's really not good for them. Molly, on another note though, I was looking at the campaign. I was looking at the campaign finance reports. And on Open Secrets, I noticed that Andrew Romanoff got over $60,000 from the University of Colorado. So it's a little bit of a head scratcher that University of Colorado is giving money to a campaign but yet cutting hours of students that are trying to get themselves through college. Wow. Yes, it is. Where does the money go? Where is it coming from? If it's not there to take care of our students and our kids, why is it to go towards politicians that are voting to take the rights away and opportunity away from young Americans? This is Molly Vogt and I am sitting here with Kim Munson and our guest chick today, Francoise Bergen. And we are talking about kind of the war on the American dream and what it is that we can do to get our country back on track. Interesting that we have Francoise with us because she came from Europe. Thank you. Thank you. She came from Europe. So she's got some good stuff she's going to add to the conversation today. And I'm curious to see what you all think about this. We're going to have a student call in sometime today during the show. Her name is Lindsay and she is one of the students at CU that's being affected by this new cut on the hours that I was talking about. But I think it's interesting. On the one hand, people are talking about how bad this healthcare law is because so many people are losing their insurance. So many people's policies. The prices are going up. The out-of-pocket is going up. Everything is going up. But I also just saw that for 550,000 people in Colorado are losing their insurance. Department of Insurance just came out with that number, right? Yep. And so in addition to that, now we have students and teachers whose hours are being cut so that they don't have to pay for that insurance policy. You know, and Molly, it's really a question of why should government, why should the government, why should the government, why should the government, why should the government, why should the government be getting in between workers and employers to begin with? And in doing so, as you said, Francoise, that sometimes people may think it's a great idea, but look at what is actually happening to these kids. They have a job that they're able to make it work while they're in school as well as, you know, make some extra money or, you know, whatever. And the government is coming in between the two of them. And their hours are getting cut. So that means they're either going to have to find another job to augment that. They may not be able to find another job to augment that. So the bottom line is, is the student loses. Right, right. And it looks like it's teachers as well. You've got some adjunct faculty and graduate assistants also that are getting their hours reduced. And just this one college in Tennessee, the Middle Tennessee State University, has barred students and teachers. Right. And has barred students and part-time employees from taking more than one job on campus. So, I mean, think about it. Honestly. You know, students have to spend as much time as possible studying. That's the goal. That's why they're there. Right? And then if they can find a job on campus that's pretty close so they don't have to travel far or park or drive or go to do that, then they can make a little bit money to help with their books or whatever else, expenses that they need that help with. So now if they cut their hours, they're going to have to go off campus to get another job. So what is that going to do? I mean, they're going to have to work two jobs now or one job. I don't know. But it just seems completely unfair. Well, you know, the other thing that a solution that I'm sure that this government might like is student loans. So instead of letting them work, you say, oh, just take out more student loans. Where here you've got students that want to work to pay as they go, if you will. Yeah. Students are going to be in debt enough by the time they get out of college that they don't need the government to add any to their pay. Right. They don't need to add any to them. So, Lindsay, welcome. Looks like Lindsay is on the phone. How are you today? Hi there. How are you? Just great. Thanks. Thanks so much for calling in. So tell us a little bit about your situation and what happened. It sounds like you're one of the students at CU that was working part-time on campus that just now have found that you're going to have to make some adjustments given this new law. Yeah. So I worked at a food service place that is in the UMC. And about a month or two ago, I'm not exactly sure when, we were told about the 25-hour limit. So, yeah, recently I had to, I guess, just determine my future at this specific place on campus because I guess I really just wanted to have the freedom to choose how much I was going to work during the time when I would be in school. And 25 hours at minimum wage in Boulder is just not a lot. So I think that the minimum wage in Boulder is just not going to cut it for anyone, I don't think. Lindsay, you just said something really interesting, and that was freedom to choose. And so what has happened with this is that you have lost your freedom to choose, as you say, how many hours that you want to work. And that is really unfortunate. I'm sorry to hear that. Mm-hmm. So what are you going to do? Yeah. What are you, have you come up with a plan B, or what are you going to do about this? You know, I had a couple options. If I wanted to, I could have kept my job on campus and supplemented with another job that wasn't on campus because, as I'm sure you know, the 25-hour limit is split between any jobs that one holds on campus, not just for one. So I couldn't get another job on campus if I wanted to, but I decided to just take my talents off campus so that I can choose, you know, like I said, have a little bit more freedom as far as how much I want to work and need to work. Interesting thing to say. I'm taking my talents off campus, taking my talents elsewhere. I think that, you know, what's happening right now, what we're seeing is there's a lot of uncertainty out there with other businesses that are doing the same thing and cutting their hours. And it's like people are not able to use their talents. They're underemployed. They're unemployed. This new health care law is affecting so many people there. Why wouldn't we want the best? Right. We want the best people to be able to put in the hours that we need to do the job rather than stopping it right in the middle. Yeah. Lindsay, it's Kim here. And I hadn't mentioned this question, and so if you don't know the answer, not a problem, but were you required to have health insurance before you enrolled or before you went to class, or do you know for sure? I think the school makes the decision. The school makes you enroll in their automatic health insurance. It's called the CU Gold program. As far as work requirements for health insurance, they never mentioned anything to me. But, yeah, since I worked on campus, I had to have some sort of health insurance. Okay. And the reason I ask that is I had run into a woman who said her daughter had wanted to go back to school. And before she could go to class, she was required to prove that she had health insurance. And so they were really forcing her into some kind of a plan. And she was really, she was a single mom, two kids, so didn't have a lot of extra money. But yet she was forced into, I think they eventually forced her into Medicaid. But I was just, I've heard stories like that. And it sounds like that may be the case here. But I didn't mean to throw you a curveball. I just wanted to know. I just wanted to ask that. No, for sure. And that definitely is what happened with me as well because I wasn't on my parents' health insurance after I turned 19. So then, yeah, the school made me automatically enroll into the CU Gold program, which just gets tacked on to the end of my tuition and fees. Okay. Okay, that's, yeah, that's what I wanted to clarify. So we've got probably a couple of questions. We've got probably a couple of minutes more. Is there any other things that you think are important that you'd like the listeners to hear? Yeah, I was just going to go back to the fact that I just think it's a little unfair to assume that students can live off of 25 hours a week at any kind of job. I was fortunate enough to have a job that did pay me more than minimum wage. And I know that a lot of students aren't able to get those positions, especially entry-level positions don't start that much. So it's just a little unfair to assume that we're going to choose just purely our studies when, you know, we have to be supporting ourselves at the same time. There really needs to be a balance, and 25 hours a week just doesn't really cut it in Boulder, unfortunately. Right. And I'm wondering, Lindsey, what the opportunities are looking like. And Boulder out there for you to get another job. Have you started looking yet? Have you found anything? Yeah, I'm still kind of sticking with the food service industry right now. There's a lot of those kind of jobs open, like waitressing, hostess, that kind of stuff. That's pretty much what I'm limited to at the moment, just because I don't have any other experience. Well, and Lindsey, what about your friends that are in the same situation? Are they a little restless about it? Are they a little anxious about it? Are they worried about this decision? Or have you talked to them about it? Well, some of my coworkers actually had more than one job on campus. So they kind of felt it a little bit more than I did. So, yeah, they definitely were not agreeing with the limit that had been set. So, you know, I guess it's just up to them to decide whether they think that they can be the most helpful, I guess, in any kind of work environment. Well, Lindsey, thank you so much for calling in. We greatly appreciate it. We wish you all kinds of success this year. Thank you so much. Okay. And when we come back, we're going to have a great caller. We won't tell you who. It'll be a big surprise. Well, welcome back on this beautiful Sunday afternoon. I'm Francoise Bergen, and I'm a guest chick on The AmeriChick Show. So Kim and Molly are here with me. We're so excited to have you here, Francoise. It's a blast. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited to be here, Francoise. It's a blast. I've never been on the radio like this. Usually, I'm a call in. Yeah. Well, we love having you. So anyway, we have a caller, don't we? We do. We have Tim Phillips on the line. Tim, are you there? I am. Good afternoon, ladies. Hi, Tim. Hello. Thanks so much for joining us. For anyone out there that doesn't know, Tim Phillips is the president of Americans for Process. a group that I love, I work with, I walk with every day. And the two women here with us, Kim and Francoise, have both volunteered and worked and walked with Americans for Prosperity here in Colorado. So thanks to them. Tim, we are talking today about the war on America and the American dream. And when we were with you in Dallas just last month, AFP was talking about how to defend the American dream. So why we wanted to have you on today is just to see if you could tell us real quick, what is the American dream? And why is it that you think it needs defending? To us, the American dream is the idea that every American from any walk of life, regardless of their circumstances, can go out and make their dreams come true here to a greater degree than anywhere else on earth or at any other time in human history. And that's whatever their version or vision for their dream is. For some folks, it's not. For other folks, it means going out and building a big business and creating jobs and generating wealth and being wealthy. For other folks, it means maybe getting a good, solid, decent pay and 9-to-5 job and really going after the real passions in their life, their church or synagogue or their community or other philanthropic endeavors where they can give their time. For every American, it's different. But we believe that Americans for Prosperity, that it's economic freedom, individual freedom, that at root gives us a better future. And that's what we're doing. It gives Americans the best shot at this American dream.",
