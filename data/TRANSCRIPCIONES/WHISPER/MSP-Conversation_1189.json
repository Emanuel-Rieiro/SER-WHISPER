    "text": " So what we want to talk about today is the very exciting topic of mathematics and patent law. So before we launch into this topic, let me give just a quick background of why we got interested in talking about this in the first place. So this summer, I was at a conference where I was working on a large database project called the LMFDB. What does LMFDB stand for, Anna? The LMFDB is the L-functions and modular forms database. So what we were doing at this conference was building the database. So coming up with all these L-functions, modular forms, and friends and pouring them into this database. So you can think of this as just a huge collection of algebraic objects. So these are like curves and lattices and polynomials and things like that. And so it came up at this conference, the discussion, of whether or not we should seek some sort of copyright, trademark, or patent on the database and the objects therein. And this was a rich discussion which was never actually resolved. And it's not so important what the resolution would have been anyways. But it really got me thinking what a strange question that was to ask if you could have intellectual property ownership over an algebraic object. Like a curve or an equation. It just struck me as so odd. So I called Annie and told her how odd this was. With a lot of excitement. Anna was like very, very excited to explore this topic. Which I of course love because enthusiasm is one of my favorite traits about Anna. Let me give you just the most basic version of the question that we're asking. So what this really looks like is if you have inequality, let's take one that most school children learn at some point. So if you have inequality, let's take one that most school children learn at some point. The Pythagorean theorem. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. This is kind of like asking if old Pythagoras could have gotten a patent on that expression. This idea that the leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse in a triangle. So what do you think? Well, so first maybe let's define what a patent really does for somebody. And it's pretty interesting actually. The USPTO. Or the Patent and Trademark Office. Explains that when somebody gets a patent. What they're getting is the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention. So what, like in particular, people aren't getting the right to make it themselves. What they get is the right to tell others they can't make it. Right, so Pythagoras wouldn't have been getting the right to state. His fact about triangles. But he would have been excluding other people from using it. Wait a minute. But then, so like, I guess what does it mean to use the Pythagorean theorem? Is this like if anyone ever draws a triangle, they would be in violation of his patent ownership? Or like if you use the fact that A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Where does that sort of roll out? Well, interestingly, by all accounts. And by all legal holdings. Pythagoras could not have obtained a patent on that equation. And there are a variety of ways to explain exactly why. But I think the most straightforward is that it's been determined through years and years and years of patent legislation and rulings. That abstract ideas are not patentable. So think of Pythagoras as making this statement. Leg squared plus leg squared equals hypotenuse. And that's all he said. He didn't say, and you can reach this conclusion in order to build a house with a beautiful triangle on the roof. Or you can reach this conclusion and generate triangles willy nilly using this contraption that I've invented to enact this equality. All he said was this is a reality that I have identified. So am I to understand then that the thing that makes something equal is the fact that it's not a triangle? Or is it a thing that makes something patentable? Is not whether or not it has an application. Because certainly the Pythagorean theorem has applications. But whether or not it's actually an applied thing. That's it. You need to be able to operationalize or encode some sort of direct usefulness to the particular statement that you've come up with. So in general, things that are patentable are not. In general, things that are patentable are processes or machines or things that you can manufacture. Not concepts. Which is exactly what this a squared plus b squared equals c squared amounts to. It's a concept. But it doesn't automatically come with a way of using it. So right. So patents need to be useful. They need to be new. And they need to be what the U.S. patent says. And they need to be what the U.S. patent and trademark office calls non-obvious. So like they can't just be something that anybody walking down the street is going to be able to state out loud. Like the sky is blue. That's obvious. I think there's something also interesting to the fact that this a squared plus b squared equals c squared. It's not as obvious as saying the sky is blue. But it was true before you said it. Right. It's not as though Pythagoras created something new. He merely said something that was true all along. That's spoken like such a devoted mathematician as you are just the vessel through which universal truths can be brought into this world. And I couldn't agree with you more. I think that math is just a way of writing down in a very particular language things that are true. But like is math discovered or invented is such a wonderful philosophical question. This reminds me of a horrible quote that I heard from a mathematician recently who wrote some very complicated equation on the board and said, do you understand this equality? It's not a matter of math. It's just a matter of eyesight. Oh. Because when something feels so obviously clear to you, you think, well, a squared plus b squared equals c squared. It's simply true. Yeah. Right to you. The math once uncovered, it does become merely a matter of eyesight to understand. Yeah. To understand it. And that's actually what makes a mathematician, right? You know, everybody has the capacity. And this is a belief that you and I have strongly, right? Everybody can do math. Sure. What makes a mathematician is their engagement with the subject matter to the extent and to the point where it becomes a matter of eyesight, not a matter of deep wrestling understanding anymore. Because you've passed that exposure and that experience. Anyway. That's an aside. That's a little bit off in a different direction. But nevertheless, we can rest assured that something like the Pythagorean theorem is not patentable. And I think we can both agree that neither is it patentable nor should it be. If you were able to patent things like that or equivalent things, you would be seriously throwing a monkey wrench in the ability for people to do anything down the road. Right? Like if you have a patent on the Pythagorean theorem or the quadratic formula or something like that. I don't know the equation of a line. You would be hindering everybody else from ever using them or really even like looking at a line, right? Or imagining a triangle, right? Those would be patent infringements somehow. Right. It would have been far too costly to invent calculus if you had to pay for the use of every single function. Right. And that's exactly going back to this idea of like excluding people being the right thing to do. Right. And that's the kind of thing that you are granted when you receive a patent. Patents are really only enforceable when the person who holds a patent goes after another party for infringing on it. That's like you're basically granting the right to legal action. And what it amounts to is a lot of money in the form of licensing fees or lawsuits. Okay. This is interesting. So I have to be very upfront with you that I don't know very much about patent law. I'm kind of flying by the seat of my pants here with you. And I think that right now I feel pretty convinced that mathematics shouldn't have patents. But check back in with me in a few minutes and see if I still feel that way. Okay. I should also own up to the fact that I am no legal expert. But I did have the benefit of a\u2026 Oh, you sound like one. I'm merely referencing in my mind this wonderful conversation I had with a professor of intellectual property law. At William & Mary Law School, Sarah Wasserman-Ryatz, who was very kind and spoke to me about this at length about a month ago. And I really appreciated her insights. I'm Sarah Wasserman-Ryatz, and I'm an assistant professor at William & Mary Law School. But I myself am no expert. So right now I think we're in agreement that math is simply a matter of eyesight. It should not be patentable. I love that. The eyesight test. Oh, it's so mean. Let's dial it up just one notch. There are other things, specifically algorithms come to mind, that have a little bit more creation involved with them. So I think of algorithms as not just being like plain as the nose on your face, but maybe as plain as\u2026 A recipe. Exactly. Which is exactly what an algorithm is. It's a set of instructions. It's a defined process for achieving something. Right. So a weird example of this, which most people don't think of as an algorithm, but indeed it is. Have you ever multiplied several multi-digit numbers together? Frequently. And you put one on top of the other. Frequently, right? You put one on top of the other and take the digit to the farthest right and multiply it by everything on top. And then you put a zero and do this again, right? And what you're really doing\u2026 I'm having this image in my head of being in third grade and learning how to do this. And having it be such a, like, brilliant thing. Having it be such a, like, breakthrough, right? Like, oh, if I do these things in this particular order, I will be able to multiply these two numbers together and get the correct answer every time. And it's mysterious. Yes. When really all you're doing is just distributing. All you've done is taken the first thing and break it up into the ones, tens, hundreds, whatever, and then you're distributing. You're using the distributive law. But no one would ever recognize it as that. Because when you learn it, it's this incredibly opaque thing. But it's an algorithm for multiplication. Now, what's weird about that is that, well, first of all, to be honest with you, I don't know if they even teach people how to multiply like that anymore. It's been a long time since I was in third grade. But how else would you multiply? Like, can you imagine an alternative universe in which\u2026 Annie, I got to tell you, these people who are coming out of school right now, the way that they add and multiply, they make grids, they figure out how to do it. They fill out numbers, this new math. I have to be perfectly frank with you. I'm not quite sure how it works. But this is a really good\u2026actually, that's a really great\u2026like, you understand the math. What you don't have a good grasp on are the algorithms by which the math is achieved. Exactly.",
