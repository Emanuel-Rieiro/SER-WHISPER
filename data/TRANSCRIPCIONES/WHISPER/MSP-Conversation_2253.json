    "text": " Steven and other characters, I think in modern shows, they make it a lot more complex where there are multiple sides to the story instead of just kind of the good versus evil thing. Steven really wants to know the person and like he changes them. It's not that they necessarily were good underneath all of it, but it's that he helps their hearts like come out. And that's very, very cool to have like this little boy main character show so much compassion, especially for kids of all ages and genders and everything watching. And it's not like teased or made fun of for acting this way. He's like awarded and like praised for it. And it's like, hey, you know, it's a really cool thing. Like we could have they could have like destroyed the city and talked them down. Everyone loves him for it. I think that's it's really. It's I love the the trend of goodness that we see in new recent media, especially because the world is like pretty shitty right now. Just yeah, it's been particularly I'm not going to get into it. But I think that I read this article about what they called nice core movies. Things like there was this movie called Hearts Beat Loud, which had Nick Offerman in it and like his daughter. And they just it's about them and in their relationship and like forming a bond. And that's it. And it's very like about the goodness of relationships and things and like the Paddington Bear movies and just how like goodness can be entertaining, too. And we don't need all this grittiness. We don't need we don't need to see a lot of like badness. We sometimes just need like a good feel good movie that makes you I don't know, just believe in goodness of things. Yeah, that article actually remind me of something. And this isn't technically magical girl, but it is the fairy. Tell sort of genre. Well, I mean, it is. But it reminded me of this. So I have I have kind of mixed feelings about the live action movies that have been coming out. Like they're great. Sometimes they're terrible. And but I love the Cinderella remake. Yes, because it really took me by surprise. Like how how good it like just how good it was. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't a complete copy of the original. And it was so one of the taglines of the movie was have courage and be kind. And that just sounds like kind of like some Pinterest saying, you know, like, it's just whatever. But it was really it made a lot of sense as you watch the movies, because the whole point is that like her life is pretty terrible. And she she doesn't you know, people complain about like, well, she should have just why did she wait on a prince to save her? She should have just left. But the movie makes it very obvious that. She doesn't have anywhere else to go. And also that house that mansion is kind of the last thing of her parents that she has. So she feels very loyal to staying there and keeping that in her family, which is now just her really. And it takes a lot of bravery to stay and, you know, still be kind. Like it was it could have been very easy for her to turn bitter and to turn mean and to, you know, just be a mean. Bitter person. And she still stayed kind. And that's very difficult to do in a situation like that. And so it was just I don't know. It was a nice like lesson that I wasn't expecting to get out of it. So I really love that motto. And I think it applies to definitely Steven Universe and a lot of those other other shows were instead of fighting evil with with violence and actually, you know, like having sword fights and stabbing. Somebody, you know, it's like an attempt to maybe convince the person not to be evil. You know, it's like it sounds silly, but there are a lot of stories these days where it's like compassion and and kindness and stuff is really what ends up saving the day. That's cool. I agree. Cinderella also took me by surprise. I remember going in to see it just as a I knew it was going to be pretty. I'd seen the trailers and things. I was a little confused if it was going to be a musical. Or not. But I went in to see it and I just walked out just like it was just a very good experience. And it you're so right. Like the have courage, be kind seems like it would be cheesy. But the way that it was portrayed in that movie, I think, was really powerful, especially with how the first Cinderella was made it. I am grateful that we get to consume more media now that is so carefully and complexly constructed, where I feel like a lot of things, at least that I grew up with, were a little more straightforward. I think the movie really emphasize that. Yeah, because I think there was one scene where she was like going to the market or something and someone like some other character like just straight up asked her, why don't you leave? And she gave this really like sweet response of like, well, I, you know, I can't. There's nowhere else for me to go and that's my home. And I was just like, oh, it just. Yeah. And and having her in the movie, I mean, it was a really good time. I mean, she's like, I don't know. It was a really good time. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. But I think that's a really good thing. And I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing. And she was like, well, I couldn't go. I was going to the supermarket. But she's like, oh, my God. I can't. When you get home, honestly, it's a mischief. She's going to go in that fest. So, it's often just a time when, you know. I can't, there's nowhere else for me to go and that's my home he was, and I was just like, oh, it just. Yeah. And and having her as a role model is really wonderful because she like, kindness is so hard. And she she could be angry sometimes, but also like forgiveness is really difficult as well. I think sometimes I don't think every really deserves forgiveness. This is of course. like you can't just say blanket things because like different circumstances i get it but i do think that there is there is strength in being able to be kind and courageous and cinderella was a really good movie and now i need to re-watch it i've been wanting to re-watch it for so long but i don't it's not on anything and her dress though just like as a side note her dress and like the way it like when she spun how it twirled i was just like i was i was stunned by it because i did not think it would look that beautiful oh yeah i mean as a as a cosplayer and i've seen i've seen people cosplay her before i'm just like dang i have a friend who cosplays uh the the prince and i'm just like all the costumes in that movie were so good i know i know i mean she sort of has a magical girl transformation i guess bringing it back to the theme yeah but it just didn't remind me because i feel like that's a it's a main theme that i've been noticing in a lot of uh media this these days and since a lot of the media that i still watch is kind of the magical cartoony stuff um it's something i've been noticing and it's i think that's just a you know it just kind of reflects what the people that are making these shows want to put out as messages yeah i think i think the point is that well we shouldn't bear our heads in the sand with like news and bad things and everything and the show that we're going to be making just because it's a real TV show we're going to be making it right because it's a new show we're going to be making it ready to do it right and then when we're shit going on but i think that the people putting good out into the world and putting up uplifting like stories and things like that and and good deeds and everything um i mean it helps make things a little better so i like i like appreciating that is good and i don't know if this is like really uh i don't know if i can't say if this is like a cultural thing or not but i feel like especially now with a lot of um maho shoujo titles kind of being a little bit more gritty like they're they're tough issues are really dire and really intense whereas you still have that in western shows but it's a little bit dialed down like there's still a lot of got like betrayal and you've got like you know conflicted feelings for the protagonists and hard choices and all that sort of conflict like it's still going on but it's different kind of conflict it's not nearly intense i feel like i think i think maho shoujo has always had a little more tragedy than the western genre adapted um like with uh sailor moon how queen serena and endymion died like she has this whole tragic backstory of of their kingdoms like being destroyed and wars and things and while magical girl things in the west kind of still deal with heart issues they're not as senselessly tragic sometimes okay every day i regret it i regret saying the word senselessly because i think it has a point and it can be also very like beautiful moving um but particularly in regards to a magical rising project which i love uh is still it has an element of cruelty to it that the characters eventually overcome but not after but they've already lost so much so they can't ever get back what they've lost but they have still they can maybe forge a better world than what they had come to know whereas with magical girl anime and uh or magical girl cartoons and western things i think they still deal with like a lot of pretty dark things like at least in star forces the forces of evil and steven universe also uh has a lot of very dark truly upsetting things poor steven i just want to protect him and he just wants to protect everyone he loves and everyone he knows and a lot of shit has gone down and all of this but it's still not quite as hopeless i think as at least some of the magical girl genre or maho children that i enjoy yeah i feel like a lot it's a lot more bittersweet like yeah so much bad stuff has happened that you know to kind of get a semi-happy ending it's like the best you can do whereas in western shows it's like yeah they deal with a lot of big issues like they deal with loss they deal with living in other people's shadows they deal with really tough things but it's a lot of big issues all things that can be overcome and it's still a show for kids that needs to come on again next week and still be kind of like upbeat for them i guess yeah it's not just like sugar-coated cutesy stuff that doesn't really you know doesn't really impact you it's just like fun to watch it's it's like there's a lot of real life things that go on and it's it's just good writing yeah and what else is there to talk about i feel like i i we i i kind of regret because i think we talked about uh our like conclusion stuff before before i got to what i wanted to talk about what else you want to talk about but i wanted to talk about how western shows different differ from um yeah our maho shoujo particularly with miraculous ladybug i wanted to bring that up because i adore this show as well yeah while i don't um from what we've seen so far it does not go into as deep themes and i don't know if it's going to be as deep as the show that we've seen as we were just talking about with steven universe or star versus the force of evil or she ra or whatever um although it does but it's much more in a personal um interpersonal and like familial way um especially with adrian and his uh his his father um yeah it's a little more light-hearted but i'm gonna i'm gonna quickly i'm gonna quickly give a a brief kind of synopsis sort of thing of this real quick um miraculous ladybug features these two kids and it's a french animated show so you can watch it on the web and it's a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit much it in the sub or the dub dub takes a little bit of getting used to but i genuinely enjoyed it um and the french sub is like really cute but it's these two kids and they go to school together um they don't really know each other that well one of them is marinette and the other one is adrian and marinette is kind of an awkward kind of clumsy girl but she's like silly and goofy but not like she has personality she's not necessarily like the every girl who is just average on all accounts um and then adrian is the very popular boy but he's also very humble he's also a supermodel it's fine they're like 14 it's okay and they both have these magical items marinette has little earrings and adrian has a ring that helps them transform into miraculous ladybug and cat noir and they are the like superheroes of good look good luck and also bad luck and they fight together to get rid of these uh butterflies who infect people and like bring out their like fears or hatred or whatever turn them into monsters so the thing with this show that is so wonderfully addictive is that it is a love square which i just like absolutely fucking adore okay so marinette is in love with adrian because she thinks he's so cool and like he's like very cute and everything adrian doesn't really know marinette he she's like kind of weird but like they're friends i guess meanwhile cat noir is absolutely in love with adrian and he's like ladybug so adrian is in love with ladybug and and ladybug is in love with adrian but they don't know it because it's flipped and so every time like cat noir is with ladybug he just like is trying to get her attention and every time ladybug or marinette is with adrian she's trying to get his attention but adrian doesn't get marinette and marinette doesn't get cat noir and it's just like it's just a lot but it's very very cute and this whole show hinges on secret identity identities because they both don't know like if the other one or their friends are going to accept them if they know that there are superheroes so they're juggling the the high school and the superhero aspect of it constantly and then there's like the big evil villain and we don't really know like who he is and marinette is kind of dealing with her friend who is a blogger and this mean girl who loves who loves ladybug but hates marinette and then like adrian has issues with his father and his mom died and there's just a lot going on but it's not so much tragedy and stuff it's still like they are magical girls they transform with their magical items into their superhero selves but it's very much superhero tropes of like how will they figure out my secret identity but magical girl things of like oh no i need to finish my math homework but there's a demon like evilized akuma outside what are we gonna do and it's very very cute and that's that's my spiel everyone should watch it it's all on netflix yeah yeah yeah yeah that's all i wanted to talk about with that though because i think the other differences in western shows we've kind of touched on but definitely a lot of magical girl cartoons take more of the superhero route um even though in they kind of do blend together sometimes and in maho shoujo they call them superheroes sometimes but it's very much they mean different things culturally especially in like magical girl cartoons where they have superhero costumes and like people who they who the superheroes like personas are but then they have to very much keep it kind of under wraps there are there is an element of secret identities in maho shoujo i think but it's a it's a little less it's less like oh no what if the world knows that i'm miraculous ladybug versus like maho shoujo being like oh no what if this cute boy i likes knows like what who i am in my superhero suit they're like what that i fight aliens and that i'm really really weird so it kind of takes on a more like global sphere of like like like like like like like like like like like like like\ufffd\u3053\u306e That is a uses the sphere in magical girl cartoons in the west",
