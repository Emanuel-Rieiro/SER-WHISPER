    "text": " Thank you. Welcome. Welcome. How are you all doing tonight? Are you doing okay? Good. Great. Well, we are really excited to have you here in the house tonight. My name is Molly Quinn. I'm the Director of Public Programming here at Housing Works Bookstore Cafe. We are really excited to welcome you to one of tonight's panels for the Penn Festival and are excited to welcome all of our friends from Penn here in the house tonight as well. So before we get started with tonight's exceptional panel, I'm just going to take about 30 seconds of your time to tell you a few key things about this bookstore and this organization, all of the work that we do here at Housing Works all year long. So Housing Works is a healing community of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS. Our mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS through relentless advocacy, the provision of life-saving services, and entrepreneurial businesses that sustain people's lives. And we want to help people sustain our efforts. So that last part is what this bookstore is, one of our entrepreneurial businesses. And the way that works is that every single thing here in this bookstore is donated to us, all of these books and movies and LPs. And the team of booksellers and bartenders and baristas that help us out here at Housing Works is made up of volunteers, which is so wonderful. So as you purchase books or coffees or beers tonight, we hope you will give our volunteers an extra smile and an extra thank you. There are a number of ways to get involved. There are a number of ways to get involved. We're always involved with all the wonderful work that we do here at this organization. You can donate your old books to Housing Works. You can volunteer your time with us. You can host events, just like this one. You can also rent out the space for private use. We have private functions like weddings here at the bookstore almost every single weekend. So if you happen to be looking for a private venue, we hope you will check out all of that information, which is all available online. All of our events, like public programs and sales and fun things going on at the store, is always available online at HousingWorks. HousingWorks.org slash events. And these postcards that are behind me are also up at the register, which list our entire May calendar. We have really great readings and comedy nights, storytelling competitions, panels, book launches, and other really fun things at the store. So we hope you will come back and see us really soon. You can also catch up with us on social media, on Twitter and on Instagram. We're at HousingWorksBKS, which is another great way to keep up with our events calendar, our sales, and all the other cool things that we do here at HousingWorks. All right. So I'm very, very glad to welcome you all here tonight. I want to say a special thank you to our friends and colleagues at Penn America for bringing part of the festival here to our beautiful bookstore. And thank you all for coming out tonight. So we're going to get started. We're going to watch a really quick video from Penn, and then your panelists are going to join you. And I'm just going to read our bio of our amazing, amazing moderator tonight before the video. So I'm going to read the bio, and then you're going to watch the video. And then she's going to come here. So you have to remember what you learned and who that is. Can you do that? There's a video. You can remember. Okay. So our moderator tonight is the amazing Amy Gall. Amy Gall's work has appeared or is forthcoming in Tin House, Vice, the L.A. Review of Books, Poets and Writers, Guernica, Brooklyn Magazine, Joyland, Pink, among others. She earned her MFA in creative writing from the New School and is currently working on a collection of essays about sex, violence, and the body. So here's the video, and then there's going to be Amy. Thank you. Thank you. Words. They're just words. In Turkey, President Erdogan uses words to describe journalists he doesn't like. He calls them ignorant, agents of subversion, foreign spies, terrorists. As of January, at least 151 writers and journalists in Turkey have been arrested and detained without charge or are awaiting trial. Words. In China, censors simply delete the ones they don't like. President Xi Jinping told writers and artists, they should work toward promoting party ideology. Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo penned seven sentences and is serving 11 years in prison. Words. Iranian Shiva Nazar Ahari protested for human rights. Saudi Arabian Ashraf Fayyad wrote a book of poetry. Filmmaker Oleg Sentsov criticized the Russian government. They're still behind bars. Words. Asked how the government might handle journalists who do not stick to the official line, Thailand's Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-o-cha used these words. We'll probably just execute them. In Mexico, Pedro Tamayo Rosas, Manuel Torres, Francisco Pacheco, Anibal Flores Salazar, and more than 70 other writers and journalists have been murdered for their words. Words. They're just words. And ideas. And films. And songs. And stories. And research. And internet postings. And Penn's been advocating for them and their authors around the world for almost a century. In countries like Russia, Egypt, Colombia, Bangladesh, and Eritrea. Countries where words are not free, and free thinkers are in danger. So when the President of the United States calls journalists the enemy of the American people, or says a news organization is going to suffer the consequences, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, he says, Words allow us to know. They allow us to wonder, to kid, to joke, to celebrate, to love. Words are truth and they deserve protection. Protection in Myanmar, in Mexico, in Russia, in Turkey, and right here in America. We need to be strong for words. And to be strong, we must come together. PEN America. Louder together. I'm Amy. And welcome to Forbidden to Liberated. Which is a discussion of sexual empowerment and sexual taboos. And I don't know, maybe if we have time, just general conversations about our sex lives. I don't know. I want to thank PEN America and the World Voices Festival and Housing Works for always putting together such incredible programming. And I want to thank all the speakers who are here tonight. This is really an honor to be among you. And thanks to everybody for showing up. So I'm going to just read out everyone's bios. And then we're all going to read for about five minutes. And then we'll start the discussion. So Sarah Barmak, right over there, is a freelance journalist and author based in Toronto. Her writing has appeared in Maclean's, The Globe, and Mail, The Toronto Star, Canadian Business, Marketing, and the Reader's Digest. Mona Eltahawy is a feminist writer and public speaker. She's the author of Headscarves and Hymens, Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution. And she lives in Cairo and NYC. Jill Filipovec is a journalist and lawyer based in Nairobi and New York City. Contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, a regular columnist for Cosmo.com, and a former columnist for The Guardian. Jill Filipovec centers her writing on the intersection of law, politics, gender, and foreign affairs. Her other work has appeared in The Washington Post, Time, and Foreign Policy. And Sabrina Jones, who's at the end, is a comic book artist, writer, and editor who began her career with the activist art collective Carnival Knowledge and alternative comics World War III, Illustrated, and Girl Talk. Her books Race to Incarnate and Isadora Duncan were named Great Graphic Novels by YALSA. And she's a journalist and author based in Toronto. Jones is also the author and illustrator of Our Lady of Birth Control, a cartoonist encounter with Margaret Sanger. She lives in New York City. So we'll start with Sarah. Thank you so much. It's great to be here. I'm just going to read briefly from a book I published last year. It's called Closer Notes from the Orgasmic Frontier of Female Sexuality. And I'm just going to read a brief excerpt from it. Just to introduce it, the book, it covers all kinds of different ways that women are exploring and exploding their sexuality today. Pushing the boundaries of their own sexualities. Whether that's making their own porn or whether that's, you know, going to Tantra classes and having hour-long orgasms. So this is just a brief excerpt of something like that. There are many ways of expanding your orgasmic repertoire. Just ask my friend Veronica, which is not her real name. She could write a few books on adventure herself. And her chutzpah has made her unlikely to ever need much help with anything. Catching a man, enjoying sex. She's a high-powered media professional who travels the world and works for a well-known company. And in 2015, she was back at Burning Man, looking for new ways to push her personal boundaries. She'd already tried nudity in a public steam bath, which was fun. Getting into a dark box with openings through which strangers could stick their arms, groping whatever they could grab, which was strange. I also did this thing where that guy played my body to music, she said. That's when she and three female friends stumbled upon an unassuming place called Spanky's Wine Bar. A sign on the door said, Sibret. I walked in and I was like, whoa, what the fuck did I just sign up for? Veronica says. What she saw in a small private room was a sort of pommel horse cut in half, with steps leading up to it and a seat and a pair of handlebars on top. On that seat was a violin. On that seat was a vibrating device the size of a plum with a little rounded nub on the end. That was where ladies were invited to take a seat. The catch, if you call it a catch, was that the contraption was controlled by a joystick. And the joystick was operated by the doctor. The doctor was a husband and father of two in his forties. Attractive enough, she says, but not her type. Whose wife was staying at the same camp and approved of hubbies and girls. In accordance with the rules of Burning Man, which asks every one of its 70,000 attendees to bring or do or perform something as a gift for everyone else, this was his contribution. He didn't have a sexual vibe at all, says Veronica. It was more like a nurse caring for you. He said that he specifically turns down all advances. The operator said he would talk or be quiet. He said he would be quiet. Touched the rider only if it helped get her off. And the rider could choose to be either naked or partly clothed. Veronica opted for no talking and no touching, but she said, I went full nude because why not? Finally, the Sybarite had a safety feature. A horn to honk in case you got overwhelmed. An old-timey bike horn. Assured by a friend who had tried it that it was worth her while, Veronica mounted the pommel horse. So, yeah, she says. Six orgasms in 40 minutes. I had the weirdest one. Sometimes I get foot cramps, but this time I had hand cramps. And my whole face went numb. It was like an orgasm from the waist up. She never did honk the horn. After 20 minutes, she and the doctor were both giggling. He said my giggles were infectious and exactly why he does this. The four friends each rode the contraption one after the other, a sterilizing alcohol wipe and a new condom on the device in between each, naturally, and emerged from the trailer in shaky hazes of pleasure, walking funny and laughing hysterically. We all walked out with the greatest faces, she says. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Did she really feel comfortable, though? As nice as the guy was, he was a heterosexual dude. He must have been enjoying himself. Veronica made it clear, though, that there was no way that he was enjoying it as much as she was. I really honestly believe him when he said that it was all about bringing pleasure to women and returning the favor for being wonderful creatures who bring life into the world, she said. It sounds hippie-ish and ridiculous, but in the moment, it was earnest. Veronica is a heterosexual woman, but at that moment she felt no desire for any man, just the desire to sit on the little plum with a condom on it. She didn't mind. She didn't mind Dr. Nurse Operator Man, not in the slightest. But he wasn't a big part of her turn-on, either. It was the pure play of it all, the feeling of being in a fit, strong body, the sensation and numbness and strangeness and laughter and weird nerve jolts coursing through her. There's a German word, functionslust, that has no equivalent in English. It means the pleasure of functioning, the enjoyment taken in performing something you do well, like a bird flying or an athlete scoring. On the Sybarit, Veronica felt functionslust. Thank you.",
