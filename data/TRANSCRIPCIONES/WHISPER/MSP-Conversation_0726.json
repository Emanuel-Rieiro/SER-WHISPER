    "text": " and this was based on a video that I saw. I don't remember the video. It might have been a BuzzFeed video but it was when like these two people who were together for some time, they broke up and then they got them back together for the video to just talk about their relationships and everything like that and it seemed like a very vulnerable experience and like you guys know that's kind of what this whole podcast is supposed to be about. It's about focusing on the vulnerabilities of people's experiences, the things that we face as people of color and one of the most intimate points of that is like, you know, relationships and long-term relationships. So me and Jess were together for two years and then we separated. That sounds like a divorce but yeah, so that's kind of what the premise of this was and I want to thank Jess in advance for agreeing to do this. So yeah, hopefully it will be a great listen and we're just gonna jump right in. So what's up Jess? How you doing today? I'm good. You're awake. Are you sure? Nervous. Why are you nervous? Let's talk about that. Why are you nervous? Because we're talking about breakups. Like it's one, you were my first real relationship, my first love and it's something I'm still working to get through a year something later. And why do you think? You're still from Detroit? Why do you think that is? Like why do you? Why do you think? Why do you think you're still working through it? I think it just because after we separated, broke up, whatever term we I want to use. Um, I kind of forced myself to just get really busy and focus on other things I had going on. So DR. Whatever I was doing when I was out in the DR and then getting ready for graduation the whole time, and was just kind of like, yeah I'm working to get through this like one day at a time type of thing. type of thing but I still had to kind of find myself in the places that I felt comfortable in the spaces that I could inhabit I think without having that like oh Kyle's girlfriend or Kyle's ex-girlfriend thing still attached to me for a really long time um which is again why I couldn't like get myself to live in the house I couldn't be around the apartments that much like didn't really want to do the dance thing again because I needed to find me and it's just now that like okay college is done with and I have like my place I have a job and I'm doing all these other things that I get to one see all the growth that happened throughout the relationship and then the growth that came after and it's still coming so when you say when you say that title of of Kyle's ex-girlfriend or Kyle's girlfriend like did you place that upon yourself after the fact or was it like other people were placing that on you or you thought other people were placing that I think it was both like the younger classes I think it was both like the younger classes that I was in and I was in college and I was in college I definitely only knew you because I mean who didn't really know you I was like oh Kyle's girlfriend or the girl that also just is making me seem like Mr. Popular I'm not I'm not really I don't think you were I don't think that's an accurate view um uh but we can we can we can that's debatable there was that and then it was just like even people that knew me only by association um I was like oh you were with Kyle or oh I thought you graduated like because Kyle no like I'm a 15 doesn't go here anymore um and then it was just me too like because you said we were together like two years so whatever started between us my freshman year for like us to break up going into senior year made it be like you're about to have a completely different like experience for what is your senior year so I had to figure out what I needed or wanted that to be so there's a lot of background story to everything um so I'm trying to like not confuse the people as we as we jump into this so uh me me and Jess met her freshman year my sophomore year uh a little bit I mean a little bit into it like I was abroad and then I came back and then I met her um you know top of 2012 12 2012 um yeah and then we didn't start going out like officially until September of that year um and so that's just a little bit of backstory um and basically to the the decision to kind of end things was on me uh because I just felt like I wasn't in my I wasn't at a place in life where I wanted to be in terms of my own happiness and I didn't want that to affect me I didn't want that to affect me I didn't want that to affect me I didn't want that to affect me I didn't want that to affect me I I built a life where I would finish my lives without uh these educated people I um you know these people that I grew up with my brother fun friends who was just basically amazing they found a challenge at a specific level but nothing I can do it was just you know means having these friends feel that we are awesome yeah um I\ubcf4 transformationalist access I kwestiy Mario or ponderm constructive subject and selling I so that like that get passed my follow someone way too early 0 0 0 say and think I don't know a talking to a number very deep 0 um so uh stick around and stay tuned and find out on the next episode of dragon ball z like you know like you never really know what's gonna happen and i i to be to be honest it's like a self it's like a selfless thing and it's a very selfish move on my end i think in terms of wanting that because in doing something like that you're choosing to end something that that two people enter together and it's so it's been for so long and so intimate you get so close to each other um that it's uh it's a hard thing to do and it's a hard thing to say out loud and it's a hard thing to accept um in the long run so i guess how at the beginning like how how did you first deal with it like deal with the breakup first deal with it um other than those hours of crying or what felt like hours of crying in your house um really really sad and pathetic moment but um the flight to dr was really rough um the first one so from new york to miami i was one of those sad burrito things like you see those things on tumblr it's gonna be like i'm gonna go be a sad burrito thing i took out the blanket that i had in my backpack wrapped myself in it because i happened to like have a road to myself in the um airplane first time that's happened wrapped myself in it and just like bald slash knocked out for the flight done um the flight attendant had to wake me up when we got to miami and then i was just kind of like did that happen did it really happen because i had already texted you before i took off and i was still trying to process it um i think i had texted or called donnie before then and then i had to call my dad and that's when it got really rough because i was waiting for the flight from miami to dr i'm sitting there being like one i'm not gonna be really calling my dad that much because it'll be facetime if anything um and i felt like i needed to let him know because it's something that he had kind of like warned me about like part of it and felt like something was gonna happen and he had tried telling me this before and just one of those like i want you to be like prepared i want you to like kind of know what might be happening know how to take things um because he's always asking about you so when i called him and then i was like maybe 20 seconds into the call and like i like broke down while i was talking to him because one i needed to say it in spanish i needed it to feel comfortable for me it was like kind of downhill and then it was a lot of crying but i think after that once i got to the dr i kind of had to like straighten up i didn't really want to talk about it pretended like nothing was happening um lived with my roommates did all the work and then at night is when it'd be really rough because i felt like i needed to talk to somebody or i needed to write couldn't really write that's when tumblr pretty much became my diary that point because i just needed to get things out um but it helped for me to be away and to not have to deal with it at school right from the beginning um i leaned on my brother and my dad a lot while i was going through it which was very really helpful because they were just understanding mad yes but very understanding um and one of the girls who happened to be my roommate out there joannine she was literally like my saving grace she's she's 26 and she turned 26 while we were out there and she just kind of helped me see things from like a different perspective and then just kind of talk things out it also helped as a therapist oh wow yeah yeah wait and see things in a different way like how like what what did she what did she say that you think stuck with you i think it wasn't so much like what she said but it was just kind of like me irritating not irritating like reiterating your reasons and then like again it's not like i ever doubted your reasons or anything but it was just still really hard to hear and then kind of like going it through my head like maybe like what happened or like why that came about and how things happened um is what i was trying to do and like i talked to my mom and my dad and my dad was like i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know what to talk to her about but also i was out in the dr so like going to the beach and like giving myself that time or taking it while i was with the girls um like kind of working to accept it because i mean what i was i turned 21 and for them it was really awkward to see a girl or a woman who's 21 who's not married who doesn't have kids oh yeah they would ask all the time like where is your husband where are your kids do you have anything like that and i was like i don't know type of thing and you're talking about men in the dr no i'm talking about the girls the ones that i worked with like the 8 to 14 year olds i was working with oh okay wow all right yeah i'd ask all the time and i think it was just those things where i was like i had to kind of take and process and then just be like well this is kind of what things are right now",
