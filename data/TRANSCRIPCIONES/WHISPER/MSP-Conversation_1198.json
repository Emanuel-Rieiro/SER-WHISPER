    "text": " and news at BlogHer, and my personal political blog, where you can find me, is called Pundit Mom. I'd like to welcome you to our podcast this afternoon. I have the honor of interviewing Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Feminist Majority, a group that advocates for a variety of women's issues, including women's equality, reproductive rights and health issues, as well as for rights for all women around the world. She's one of the most notable leaders of our feminist movement, and she's also a former president of NOW, the National Organization for Women. Ellie, thank you so much for joining us today. Oh, it's great to do so. So the first thing I wanted to ask you, and a very timely reason for having you here today, is that the Feminist Majority and NOW just issued a press release announcing that you were jointly endorsing New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney as your choice, and the choice you would like to see to fill Hillary Clinton's seat. Senate seat from New York. So I wanted to find out why you did that and why you felt it was necessary to make such an endorsement. Well, it's unusual for us to do an endorsement, you know, in these special occasions where you need appointments, but we thought that Senator Clinton had occupied such a unique role, certainly a worldwide advocate for women, and also there's only 16 women without her in Congress. So I wanted to find out why you did that, and why you felt it was necessary to make such an endorsement. So I wanted to find out why you did that, and why you felt it was necessary to make such an endorsement. So I wanted to find out why you did that, and why you felt it was necessary to make such an endorsement. So I wanted to find out why you did that, and why you felt it was necessary to make such an endorsement. So we wanted to make sure that this seat would go to a women's rights leader who has proven to be a women's rights leader, and looking at New York, which is one of the strongest areas in the whole country and world for women's rights, we thought that Carolyn Maloney would be perfect, because she's been an advocate for women in the House. She's been in the House 16 years. She has a... extensive... She's shown over and over again her creativity, her determination, her tenacity in fighting for women's rights. She has passed a host of bills in many different areas, both national and global, with both national and global importance for women. And she's on a chair of a finance committee, so essentially in this economic crisis, we thought she would be perfect. Can you give us a couple of examples of some of the legislation that... she's worked on over the years that had specific and particular significance for women. Sure. She led the fight to make sure that DNA evidence kits are processed and passed the Debbie Smith bill. When no one almost would listen to us on the whole issue of the Taliban and its treatment of women, she helped pass the Afghan Women's Empowerment Act. This was before, or it was in the time when it didn't have the attention it does have now. It was before 9-11. And she's been a consistent fighter for Afghan women, but also for international family planning bills. Carolyn is the kind of legislator who, whether she's in the majority or the minority, whether her party's in the majority or the minority, she doesn't take no for an answer. And she frequently calls women leaders and say, I think we should do this. This is really necessary for women. And so she hangs in there and gets bills passed when people think it's not possible. Now, one of the names that's been floated out there, and actually I was watching the news a little bit before we got on the phone, and one of the other potential candidates for Hillary's seat that we've heard mentioned is Caroline Kennedy. And apparently today she told some people in the media that she is interested in Hillary's seat. Why Congresswoman Maloney as opposed to Caroline Kennedy? Well, we didn't look at it like that. We looked at it, why Caroline Maloney? Of course, we didn't know about Caroline Kennedy, but we do know, and this is not against somebody. This is for somebody who we know has had a proven record. It's 16 years in the House, 10 years on the City Council of New York City. And she's been a very, very good candidate. And she's been a very good She has shown her determination to pass legislation. She knows how the legislature works. She is very, very comfortable with a whole host of issues. But on women's issues, she is really just one of the few people who understands that women are not only half of the world and half the United States, but they need an advocate, that they have to have a voice. And she's been very, very good candidate. So I think that's one of the things that she's been very, very good at. have advocacy, that our issues cannot be ignored. So she's there day in and day out for us and for women of this country and of the world. But she also never forgets the citizens of New York. And she's been, as you know, a trailblazer for 9-11, commissioned for the financial district, etc. So to us, it was a perfect combination. And frankly, I've been here a long time working for women. I have had, you know, I've been here since 75 when I was chair of the board of now and president in 77. These are long years. And this is an unusual legislator. She knows how to get something done. And as I say, it doesn't matter if she's in the majority or minority. It doesn't matter if she's chair of a committee or not. She can figure out how to get a piece of legislation passed. And that's what is, it's a unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, unique, quality. It's also, she thinks up things that needs to be done. I mean, she doesn't wait to have us push for it. She's there thinking about, okay, what do we do? For example, you know, no one thinks you can pass the paid family medical leave back. She passed it through the house. I mean, it's just, she's there. She knows the issues and she makes sure they get done. And you mentioned that one of the jobs that she currently has in Congress, is that she, I believe she's the chair of a joint committee on economic issues for the house and the Senate. What sort of, what work has she done in that committee that you think uniquely qualifies her now, given our economic situation? Well, she's done a lot of work on the, on the pay gap between women and men. And she pointed out that, you know, the country, it, we don't have equality and how women's pay is not commensurate with men and not, you know, keeping up. And so, she, she used that a seat to show the, you know, the glass ceiling is still there, and how it should be changed. But on the other hand, she also knows the inner workings of the banking system, and so she's there making sure that the average person is going to be taken care of in this recovery plan. That, you know, that on-employment compensation is spread to more people and, and you know, they're, they're, they're, they're, you know, there, you know, they're not seeking back. because a lot of women are cut out of that. You know, she knows the financial issues. That's why we thought she was perfect, because we're in, as you know, a financial crisis, an economic crisis, and I know that she'll see the whole picture. She understands the whole picture. She is comfortable with these issues because she has chaired the committee, and she's dogged it, and will make sure the average woman and man is represented, as well as making sure that our financial system stays afloat. In other words, she gets it, and she has represented the financial district, but she also represents the average person, and definitely the average woman. In addition to the first few questions that I had, I also had a chance to gather some questions from some of our other BlogHer members that we wanted to ask sort of in connection with your announcements regarding Congresswoman. I'm going to start with Congresswoman Maloney. Lori White writes a blog called Lori Writes, and she wanted to know from you, why is it important that a woman hold this seat being vacated by Hillary Clinton? Would it be just as effective for women if a man was in that position who had the exact same views on issues that Congresswoman Maloney has? Well, you know, I'm not a prejudiced person, and I've worked with many male legislators, and I've worked with many female legislators, and some have been excellent for us. So I'm not speaking against a class of people. But on the other hand, we have so few women in Congress. We are so underrepresented. And whether we like it or not, we are in an era that still the women, the handful that are there, have two jobs. They represent the constituency that they're from, and they also represent the women. And so I think it's important to think about the women of the nation or the state, or sometimes, as Maloney has done, of the world. And I mean, how many men would have gone onto the floor of the House as Carolyn Maloney did, and wear a burka to show the plight of Afghan women? You know, she identifies with the possibility of being raped. That's why she hung in there for the Debbie Smith bill. So it's essential. And if we can't get a prominent woman in New York, where can we? I mean, there's so many states that have never even had a woman senator. We're still on our first this and our first that. And this seat is an important seat that she's sitting in. And I think that we're just fortunate that you have an experienced legislator, 26 years of fighting for our issues, in line. I mean, there's nobody. There's no man nor woman that is being mentioned that has the legislative experience that she has, and the passion in her heart for advancing the cause of women.",
