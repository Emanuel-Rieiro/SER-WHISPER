    "text": " I bought a hundred dollars worth of bitcoin. Each bitcoin was two dollars, so I bought like fifty. Next week, I bought another fifty. Then you're like, oh yeah, so... Wow! This is how it actually works. Three months later, it goes from two dollars to eight dollars. I go, yeah! Score! I quadrupled my investment. Which means that now, if I sell my two hundred dollars, I have eight hundred fucking dollars! I can buy an Xbox! So I sold it all and bought an Xbox. This keeps happening again. This has happened to me. This has happened to everybody who has gotten involved. It is very easy to think, I would immediately understand that this investment would go to thousands of dollars. But if you told me in 2012, it is two dollars now, but in 2019 it will be thirteen thousand dollars, I would be like, yeah, right. That is never going to happen. Let's do the same experiment. If I told you today, in three years, it will be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, how many of you would say, that is not going to happen? How many of you would say, yes? Okay. That is unrealistic. That is totally unrealistic. It might happen, but it might not. Do you take that kind of risk? Do you take the risk in January to say, it is three thousand dollars, it has been crashing for two years straight, now is a good time to buy? Everybody thinks they do that. The strategy seems simple. On its face, buy low, sell high. In practice, what you end up doing is a somewhat similar strategy called buy high, sell low. What you do is, when everybody gets excited, you buy some. Then it crashes, then you panic, then you sell it at the lowest price, and then you keep repeating that. How do I know? Done it. Right? Who hasn't? Okay, really, who hasn't? Oh, okay, five people. Very good. The bottom line is, we are all looking for this next opportunity. The reason it is not going to happen is because of the unique circumstances. I like to think of this a bit by comparing it to biology. If you think about biology, and you understand how evolution works, and how an environmental niche or area works, if there is a very successful species, and that species finds an environment in which it is very successful, it has the right amount of food, it has no predators, etc., it will dominate that environment. Dominate it. Think, for example, what happened when stupid Europeans introduced rabbits to Australia. There was nothing that could eat rabbits. Rabbits everywhere. Then they were like, let's introduce this other species that will eat that species, and then they have too many of those. If you do that in an environment where there is no fitting in that particular niche, it has no predators, and it has plenty of food, what is it going to do? It is going to all day until there are lots of rabbits. Right? That is what it is going to do. Then you have a lot of rabbits. They pop out eight in every generation, which is approximately every six days. Before you know it, talk about exponential growth. Bitcoin has nothing compared to rabbits. The bottom line is that if you have an environment in which a species becomes successful, it dominates that environment. Interestingly enough, if you then introduce another species that is similar, but slightly more efficient or more successful, it fails completely. Why? Because that environment has already been dominated. Simply sheer numbers mean that the new species, even if it is more efficient, cannot propagate in that environment. There are five of it, and there are six million rabbits. Even if it manages to be very successful, it doesn't meet very many of its own kind. But it keeps meeting rabbits. Every time there is an opportunity for food, a whole bunch of rabbits show up. This is the idea of biological evolution. If you have an environment in which there is one organism that is very successful, it dominates that environment, and it then closes that environment to everything else that can fit in that environment. What happened with Bitcoin? Bitcoin found a very unique application. That was non-government money. It can spread globally. It is completely uncensorable, decentralized, unstoppable, and borderless in a pure digital form. That application in that environment is now taken. When someone comes and says, we can do a slightly better Bitcoin, great. You can do a slightly better Bitcoin. Nobody will care. Because all of the software developers have not been trained in your slightly better Bitcoin. Right? If Bitcoin is B, let's call the other one C. It is the next iteration. Sitcoin. Let's say you have Sitcoin. It comes along and says, we are the next Bitcoin. Maybe that is true. Maybe it is a bit more scalable, has better security characteristics, or is easier to use. It has enough differentiation that if they both started out, it would win. It would absolutely win. If they both started out at the same time, it would win. But now, it starts out in an environment where all of the developers already know how to do Bitcoin. The book says, mastering Bitcoin. The software libraries are for Bitcoin. The exchanges have Bitcoin. It has a lot of liquidity. There are 26 different wallets for it. You can easily find people. You can find people at the local Starbucks or some better coffee shop to trade and get some Bitcoin. But if you start going, do you have some shitcoin? No, but we do have some Bitcoin. It is better. But I don't have any, and everybody I know is already interested in this other thing. So... How much does the new thing have to differentiate? Well, this is the real challenge. Because if it differentiates enough, if it is different enough from Bitcoin, then it is no longer occupying the same environmental niche. It is no longer competing against Bitcoin. Now it is competing for something else. Maybe it becomes dominant in that space. In order to do that, you have to do a lot of hard work. Because if you want to start a new cryptocurrency with its own security, you have to bootstrap that security in an environment where people are going to attack you on day one. On day one, nobody attacked Bitcoin. On day two, nobody attacked Bitcoin. On day 1074, nobody attacked Bitcoin. Nobody had really heard of it. Nobody thought it would work. On day 2500, nobody attacked Bitcoin. It took years before anybody thought this thing would actually work to start attacking it. By that time, it was strong enough to resist the attack. Now you go out and you're like, I have an idea, and it is better than Bitcoin. Everyone goes, They attack your system, and the next morning it is gone. Because you get hacked, you get crashed. You go out and do proof-of-work. I have a new proof-of-work algorithm. Everybody comes in with their GPUs. Why do they have GPUs? Because they have spent the last five years mining Ethereum. They have plenty of GPUs. They are like, could I take a few thousand GPUs and throw it to this new coin and see if I can dominate the network? They sure can. Then they dominate the network, and there goes your security. They are like, we can't do proof-of-work. Let's do proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake is going to be much easier. Because then, what it really needs in order for someone to attack it is rich people. Oh shit. There are lots of them, and they are all trying to break crypto now. You start proof-of-stake, and who buys all of the stake? Rich people. The only reason rich people didn't buy all of the Bitcoin in the beginning is because they thought it wasn't going to work. But if you try to do it today, they are all looking for the next Bitcoin that they can sell. To you. To the people who don't know any better. I remember when Ethereum launched. I remember receiving the email that Vitalik sent out to ask for comments. This was in December of 2013. He sent it out to a bunch of people in the space. He said, listen, I have this new idea. We are looking for developers. We are looking for investors. I would like to invite you all to read the whitepaper. So I went and read the whitepaper. I had one question. This question was, why are you not doing this on Bitcoin? Why would you go to all of the effort of launching a separate chain? So I called Vitalik on Skype. I talked to Vitalik in his kitchen. . He patiently explained to me that he had already tried to do it on Bitcoin. He had tried to do it with what is called the MasterCoin protocol on top of Bitcoin. He had very quickly realized that Bitcoin was too specific to work for the purpose that Ethereum was. You couldn't really do the same security model. He said, I think this is general enough, different enough, and important enough that it is worth the effort. To bootstrap a new security chain. It is really, really hard to do. Ethereum was different enough that it did it. Maybe. We will see. Maybe it will work. It is not yet certain. It seems to be doing okay so far, sometimes. Sometimes not so well. They managed to bootstrap a new security chain because it was different enough from Bitcoin. The interesting thing that happened is, if you talk to people who are really into Ethereum, they are like, we can do everything, including what Bitcoin does. No, you can't. No, you can't. All of the things you did to differentiate enough from Bitcoin means that you are playing in a completely different environment. You are playing for the generalized flexible smart contract space. Every choice you make for that design means you can't do it. You can't play in the highly specialized, highly secure, robust, we-can-resist attacks from governments space... for the open, free money of the world application that Bitcoin already fully occupies. Ethereum can't be the next Bitcoin. The funny thing that happens next is, while Ethereum people are like, we could be the next Bitcoin, some other people are going, yeah, but we could be the next Ethereum. Before you know it, everyone in Ethereum is looking over their shoulder and going, who are you? Where did you come from? Why are you coming from my application? It is okay, because they can't be the next Ethereum either, for exactly the same reason. The application space for a virtual machine-based, general smart contracts application platform... is solidly occupied by Ethereum. Not because it is the best, but because it got there first. It survived long enough, and it okay-ish for long enough to dominate the space. Now all of the libraries are for Ethereum, all of the application developers are for Ethereum. As a result, if you're trying to make your own thing to compete against that, you can't find enough attention. There isn't a next Ethereum, because that space is already taken. What does it take for one of these technologies to be replaced? What does it take for something to replace Bitcoin or to replace Ethereum? It doesn't happen because someone invented a slightly better solution, or even a much better solution. That will work. Instead, it can only happen if the system that already occupies this space fully fails on its own. So in order for something to be the next Bitcoin, first, Bitcoin has to fail. Like really spectacularly fail. Not a bit, not like, oh we lost $200 million because someone hacked an exchange again. Obviously, that's not enough. Not, we've been banned by China for the 37th time, and this time they really mean it. That's not enough. Right? Trump just called us drug dealers. Not enough. We've been called drug dealers before, by more serious people. It's not enough for even Facebook or JP Morgan to say, hey we can do cryptocurrency too. No you can't. Not enough. The only way Bitcoin fails is from the inside. It has to fail because of a critical vulnerability that cannot be fixed, or that people don't want to fix. It has to fail because of a failure of community. It has to fail because of a failure of trust or culture. That's really difficult to do in a technology that has so many participants, who have so many different motivations, different cultures, different languages, different operating systems, different software platforms, all collaborating around one core basic set of ideas. They have to all be disappointed for different reasons simultaneously. Very difficult to happen. For the same reason, if you want to find the next Ethereum, first Ethereum has to fail at being the current Ethereum, in order for something else to pop up. This is both good news and bad news. If you're trying to push the next shitcoin, it's bad news. I'm sorry to tell you, you don't have the next Bitcoin or the next Ethereum.",
