    "text": " In the health center delivery rooms, we were starting to also see some impacts. And the drastic reduction in rainfall was starting to impact on health services. As patients were, you know, there was no, most of the health services at the moment don't have access to clean water throughout the year. So this is something, and water and sanitation issues is a big issue in all the health centers and also schools. So it's certainly something that where people had access, health centers could continue to work. But in many cases, people don't have access to that. So health centers also had to reduce their regular work and so on. And women needing to deliver at health centers had to bring their liters and liters of their own water to be able to help in the post delivery stage and so on. So Margaret's son in. Middle fly. Mogulu. You know, he's a fire early this early this year, the signs of prolonged food insecurity were definitely very clearly evident. Increasingly indications of severe and acute malnutrition in many parts of the many, many parts of the country, but particularly in Western province, which is one of the more remote areas of Papua New Guinea. There were scenes, you know, normally you won't. See these kind of scenes and actually, when we managed to get one of the people, Sally Lloyd, who's working there and is part of the network of people, missionaries who are based at community level. When she came down to mores, we showed some of the pictures. I think many people, including in Port Moresby were quite shocked at the level of distress for families from the first reports of the drought in the middle of twenty. Fifteen. The government actually had begun. To start to respond together with partners. We, there was, there were a series of assessment missions that were sent out government together with development partners. Going to four different locations, trying to assess. Where were where were the really severe needs? Where were where were people able to cope and so on. The government allocated two hundred and three million, which is roughly. Seventy million. U. S. dollars for the response. And. This certainly isn't a small contribution. This is actually quite a significant contribution in Papua New Guinea. But as I think most of you will know, Papua New Guinea is an extremely high cost location to travel to to get supplies from Port Moresby up to some of the remote areas is extremely costly. The way that the government approached this was to allocate a large amount of that funding. Through the. Mps and I think many Mps, of course, did respond in their own constituencies and so on. And that has both positives and negatives. I mean, on the one hand, it definitely enables the local member to try and build the relationships with the constituencies. But, you know, there are obvious issues there as well about which people are local members most likely to support. Are they likely to get out into the most remote areas and so on? And I think that's a really important issue. And I think that's a really important issue. And I think that's a really important issue. And I think that's a really important issue. And I think that's a really important issue. And I think that's a really important issue. There are a whole series of issues that I think in the lesson learning workshops that are now being planned are starting to to be to be talked about much more. And humanitarian partners, including the churches, the nongovernmental organizations, PNG, Red Cross, the bilaterals, including Australia, New Zealand, European Union as well. And the U.N. system started also supporting a lot of the humanitarian activities. And I think that's a really important issue that we can all have a real sense of. activities both in terms of assessment but also in terms of starting the response in sectors like water and sanitation agricultural recovery health and education and so on now in january february of 2016 we did there was a much more comprehensive country-wide assessment which was done by the world food program and which this they used a telephone survey methodology as well as using the contacts from all of the development partners and here i'd like to pay particular tribute to colleagues from the church partnership but also mike book who is one of the leading agronomists looking from australia working very closely with a range of church partners including matthew canoe ex-secretary of the agriculture and livestock department here together using all of our networks the near near sort of country-wide assessment was done in january february and there we found that 1.4 million people were in what we would regard as you know pretty severe food insecure uh 162 000 1.4 billion sorry uh in food insecure and then 162 000 to our uh 162 000 to our to our up to about 200 000 people in what we would regard as extremely food insecure where perhaps they're having to manage on perhaps just one meal a day or even skip the one meal a day so this assessment coupled with additional reports from partners all pointed towards the need for a much more concerted longer-term support which would be required and the pro one of the things that that assessment also did was to look at some of the priority sectors the disaster management team and the joint interagency coordination mechanism for humanitarian response in papua new guinea right really had been working from the previous year but from april to september this year there's been a lot more concerted effort there was a what we regarded as a surf appeal which is an emergency appeal also where um I think in the first instance looking at all of these priority sectors we estimated that approximately to do this really effectively up to 37 million dollars would be required to be respon to be able to respond to this and to ensure that people were fed were able to look after themselves right up to the time where at least they could harvest a full harvest and be ready to plant for the next uh growing season so that's that's the first thing that we're looking at and then the 12th and 13th persons who are now at higher risk and are more economically needed\uc885 avete involved in this research and and working towards making sure that they're researched you know and invested and used and set forth in these priorities would allow people to focus less on physical activity while the most precisamente the more braucht\u1edd would be them you know those people who cannot visit the country when they are we know there's quite a number of practically education restricted and disenfranchised groups who are very much not willing to come into public health if they feel expressly Life Saving makes me \u05d4\u05d4 arbred by this futur andaccoon and\u6628 pertama time whole race which came Um strategic thinking aboutcie\u017c has only been thought through setting the agenda yet we aren't that we're looking at it now though but I'm doing this project we're focusing on this the infrastructure the way in which what we see in particular and adviser these are key categories supporting health facilities in the wash water and sanitation to try and improve clean water and hygiene practices and support for people but also in agricultural recovery thinking about seeds and tools that communities would need and also thinking about early recovery work of the 37 million appeal we received 39 percent of funding to date this work has now led to food response for that hundred six hundred and sixty two thousand food and nutrition support and we're focusing very much in the high altitude areas as well as in Milne Bay the outer islands of Milne Bay where there was also acute acute requirement for support other sectors you know have been left behind in the last few years and we've seen a lot of change in the way that we to a range of sort of more traditional mechanisms the church partnership the bilaterals the also some of the foundations to support one of the things to mention here is that unfortunately to date we haven't been able to get a lot of the early recovery work which is to try and tide communities over not just to deal with the current crisis but to help them for the longer term and to support their resilience efforts but there's a range of needs still out there but we're working with the funds that we received so in the food distribution points and here we work very closely with the non-governmental organizations and particularly care international who were the implementing partner up in the up in the Highlands for this work and I was fortunate to go up there about five weeks ago six weeks ago to see some of the food distribution taking place the food distribution is primarily focused on support with rice support for each family with very close work with the provincial authorities and with the National Disaster Management Center working with local leaders as well trying to ensure that every family has in the in in those areas up to eight weeks of support which could at least tied them to the point where they could harvest the first set of their own from their own gardens and in this we were particularly looking at the most vulnerable segments of the population female-headed households the elderly persons with disability also thinking about very hard about how to ensure that it wasn't just men who controlled this food but also women and and children who had access to this and so on so in addition to the blanket distribution you know one of the issues that has surfaced there is also a lack of access to food distribution so we're working with local governments to address this issue and we're also working with local governments to address this issue and we're also working with issues around how to deal with conflict because inevitably in a lot of these areas particularly in remote areas if you're not careful it can lead to high levels of conflict and that's something that we've need needed to navigate very closely so we are supporting the UN is supporting provincial government distribution of emergency food supplies in remote areas in Mogollon as well as in Western District as well as anger and hella and in as I said the the outer islands of Milne Bay and it is an extremely costly operation because the logistics of these areas mean that you actually have to fly a lot of these supplies up to these remote areas we're particularly thankful for one of the one of the hallmarks of this the way we have managed this is really good partnership not just between government and development partners and and non-governmental organizations but also with some of the businesses and particularly the foundations the octet II foundation the digicel foundation that I'd like to mention but also the rotary club who have played an important role as well as the sort of more traditional humanitarian partners bilaterals Australia New Zealand the European Union the USAID and others working with the UN system and with the churches and the churches and so on rice distributions are taking place in remote coastal locations as I mentioned also in Milne Bay and people living on the really remote atoll areas and one of the things we were able to do just a couple of months ago was also to take ambassador Macharia who is the Kenyan permanent representative to the United Nations and the Secretary General's one of two climate envoys we were able he came to the Pacific and we were able to get a look at the climate change in the Pacific and we were able to take him to Kiribati now out in the tropics where he saw some of the the really difficult struggles that Islanders in these remote areas were really struggling with getting sort of access to clean water and so on and it was really great to be able to take him there and actually see the impact of climate change in the longer run okay so the UN clearly recognizes Papua New Guinea as a severely disadvantaged country by the El Nino globally we have you know as I said we've been fortunately being able to also help to shine a bit more Spotlight and highlight the impact of on smaller communities and you know people living in remote areas and long atolls and so on and part of all of this also is helping us just now rethink with the national government about disaster planning for the medium and longer term. And there are a set of lessons that we're starting to learn and sharing across the development partners on some of this. And of course, at a time when this is the first year of the Sustainable Development Goals, this is really important trying to get communities also really more aware of these Sustainable Development Goals and their own role in support in working with governments, but also with others in supporting better action towards the achievement of the SDGs. PNG response this time round, more than 17 active humanitarian partners, including a lot of the donors, six priority sectors being supported. As I said, one of the new things this time round compared to 97 was the new partnerships, particularly involving private sector, working with... government, non-governmental organisations and the official aid agencies and so on. So far, we have supported up to 144,000 people during this particular... particularly in the last sort of this year, part of this year, the last five months. But actually, over the course of this, more than that number of people have been supported. A little bit about the need to continue this work, because clearly one of the big lessons of humanitarian action is that it doesn't end when the... when the rains start. These things have longer term implications because they impact on people's health, their ability to support future development interventions in their own communities and so on. But there's definitely a lot of lessons to be learned from all of us about how we could improve further next time round. But overall, I feel that we have done a pretty good job in building the right relationships, building the right partnerships and helping communities to respond. Let me stop there. It's... I've tried to cover in quite quickly some of the things, but happy to take questions or any comments.",
