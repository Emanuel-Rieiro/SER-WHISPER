I asked her if we could and then I told her to send it to us. Oh, and then I emailed her and asked her for you. So, she tagged me on it in Instagram, I think she probably tagged you on it, and then I asked her if we could have it, and yeah, we can. So I'm going to figure out how to make that into an intro. But anyways, thanks for it, your links are down below because she gave me some stuff to put down there. Oh, did she? Yeah. Awesome.

What did you do this week? Oh, okay. So, in the three days since we filmed my hair, I had Thanksgiving dinner on Saturday. On Saturday? Yeah. Is that supposed to be on Sunday? Well, it's technically supposed to be today, but Jesse worked Sunday, so we did it Saturday. And then we had... Should've just told him not to come. Just fuck you, Jesse. Yesterday, I went and watched Walking Dead with some friends, and then went over to their place, and... Yeah, that was good. It was fun. And then today we're doing the podcast, and then I'm gonna go for pizza later with someone, so that's kinda good. Yeah. Sounds good. It's good. Yeah. Good. It's good. What did you do? I... Okay, so... This is an exciting weekend for me. Not really. Okay, let's start with Saturday... Yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday. I forget what I did the first two days of the weekend. What did you do yesterday? Yesterday? So I woke up in the morning, and I got a call from Stephen. Uh-huh. Oh. And I was like, Hey, I'm going to pick up something by your house. I live out in, like, the middle of nowhere, and he does too, but he's like, okay, I'm coming to pick up something by your house, and then I'll stop by. I was like, okay, what is it? He's like, oh, you'll see. I was like, okay. So then, he comes in, he just, like, walks into my house, and, uh, because we're eating breakfast, and he's like, my mom's sitting there, she's like, what did you buy? And he was like, what do you mean, what did I buy? She's like, you bought something stupid. We all know you bought something stupid. What is it? And he's like, I bought a go-kart. And... She's an idiot. I was like, that is awesome! My mom's like, you're so dumb! And I was like, because one of the amusement parks in Edmonton, White Mountain Amusement Park, just closed down. Oh my god. So he went there, and he was like, are you guys selling your go-karts? And they were like, yeah. And they were like, oh yeah, it's $3,000 for one. Because they're, like, the super fast ones, right? And he was like, okay, can I talk you down a bit? So he, like, started, like, wheeling and dealing with them, and then so, I, like, go outside, I'm, like, looking in his truck, he has the go-kart at the back of his truck, and I'm like, this thing's awesome! Oh my god. And, uh, and he's like, oh yeah, but, I didn't buy one. I was like, how many did you buy? He's like, I bought five. I was like, what? So he bought five go-karts. What the fuck is he gonna do with five go-karts? He said he went in, and he started talking to them, and he said, okay, like, buying one go-kart is, like, fun, but, like, you can't go with anybody. Oh my god. So he needed to buy two, so that they could have, like, a race, but then, like, three makes a better race, because there's three, and then, like, five is just, like, a fleet that you can, like, Oh, that makes sense. So he bought five go-karts, and he got them for, like, a really good deal, because he just started wheeling and dealing them, but, uh, so yeah, he just brought over a go-kart. He's like, yeah, wanna go for a rip? I was like, sure! So then we got the go-kart down and started it, and I have videos. I should, uh, I should post a couple videos of us. You should! They're so much fun. They go, well, the one that he brought over goes just over 40 miles an hour. Oh my god. Which is, like, 70 kilometers an hour. And we're, like, ripping around my area, and, like, you just go sideways, you're just, like, drifting everywhere. That's fucking crazy. It was so much fun. Oh my god. And we burnt the seatbelt in half. No! On the muffler, so we didn't have a seatbelt either, so we were just like, woohoo! Oh my god. It hit the ditch a couple times, but yeah, it was fun. Wait, which place, is that the one with the batting cage, too? Yeah. That's where I went go-karting! Yeah. It's, like, right on, like, white mud, and, uh, 66. Yeah! I went there with that religious guy! Oh, yeah! Yeah! And he brought his own helmets, and he's like, I'm not gonna give you lice on our first date, so here. Oh, yeah. I've gone there with him before, actually. Have you? Yeah. A couple times. Did you bring helmets? Yeah. Yeah. I went go-karting with him there. He sucks at go-karting. I'm awesome. Um. He waited for me to catch up, which I thought was nice. Oh, yeah, I wouldn't have done that. I would have lapped you, and then just hit you. Yeah, yeah, well. I've done that before. Right out of the gate, they, like, fell on the side, and I was like, I'm not gonna be the loser this time! And I was. I was still the loser. Yeah, you were. You probably were. Um. So, yeah, that was fun. Yeah. That was an exciting morning, and then right after that, I went to Jamie So's for Thanksgiving dinner. Mm-hmm. And, um. Your mom was collected, and. And my parents came, and my mom got very drunk. Like, obnoxiously drunk. Uh, which is normal. That's totally normal. Um. Don't worry about it. And then we started playing Apples to Apples, which is the funniest game ever to play around drunk people. Fact. So, if you guys don't know what Apples to Apples is, they, you draw an, uh, adjective? Is it an adjective? Sure. It's a describing word, right? Yeah. It'll say, like, um, clumsy. And then you have seven cards in your hand that are all nouns, and you're like, you have to try and find the one that fits it the best, and it's like, clumsy, and I go, elephants! And then whoever's is the best gets the card. It's the Childhood Cards Against Humanity. Yeah, yeah, it's like the, yeah. Um, so then my dad got a card, and he's like, I don't even know what this is! And I was like, what do you mean? He's like, I was like, sound it out, he's like, Tupac Shacker. Tupac Shacker. I was like, I was like, what is this? And there's like a little description. I was like, what does this description say? He's like, he's an American raper. I was like, Tupac Shacker. I was like, Dad. Dad. I was like, Tupac Shacker. The American rapper, you idiot. And he was like, I was like, you don't know who Tupac is? He's like, no. He's like, he's an American raper. And then, my mom got super drunk, and every time she put down a card, she would always forget which card she put down. So we would be like, okay, this one wins. And everyone would be like, looking around, be like, oh, that's not mine, that's not mine. And my mom would just be like, who won? And we're like, mom, it's you. She's like, oh, I put that, oh, cool! She had no idea what she was putting down half the time, and she won, like, half of them. That's great. And then she got one, what was it? Oh, she got one that says, picking your nose? And she couldn't read it? She was like, pickling your nose? She's like, that doesn't even make any sense! What's pickling your nose mean? I just like your pickling. They just got drunk and said stupid things.",
