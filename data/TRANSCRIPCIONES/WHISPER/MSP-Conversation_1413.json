    "text": " I am really pleased to be here. I'm really pleased to have heard David talk about how this event is going to be full of fun and charity. I was a missionary of charity for 20 years. We didn't have a lot of fun. But I want to thank everyone for inviting me here, especially Pamela and David and the audio-visual guru Bruce and all of his friends for patiently helping me with the mechanics of this presentation. I'm going to talk a little quickly because I know you're all smart and can keep up, and also because I think I'm starting my presentation a little late and don't want to throw everything off schedule. So here we go. Follow along for the ride. Exploring new questions intrigues me, and for this presentation I knew that I wanted to think about stories. As I explore new questions, the words I send in response to the email you send saying, we need your title now, we're sending the program to press, don't quite fit when I actually get around to talking to you. So this is the title about stories that you all have in your programs. But if I were asked for a title today, I think it would be this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. repeat what the fuck 77 times during our presentation. Stories are important. Our brains have designed themselves for stories. The brain's basal ganglia arranges events, thoughts, desires, memories, and so much more into narratives with beginnings, middles, and ends. Stories give us a way of organizing the world. They inspire us. Stories sometimes place us within a tradition and sometimes invite us to dream of worlds far, far away. Stories help us to imagine that our future can be different from our past. Stories help us to know who we are and who we can be and so much more. Stories convey values. A lack of stories can be dangerous and dangerous. Let's give you a very personal example. My only brother Joe came to recognize that he felt no romantic feelings towards girls. He was drawn to other young men his age. He was a teenager in southeast Texas in the 1980s. The beloved son of a Catholic family where his parents obviously had plenty of sex but never ever talked about sex. Joe knew of no one else who felt the way he did. He had a lot of friends and family. He had a lot of friends and family. He had a lot of friends and family. He occasionally heard mention of fags and the local Christian radio and TV shows often ranted about homosexuals. But he couldn't understand how feeling the way he did made him an evil person. And he couldn't find anyone he felt safe talking to about this. The result? Extreme shame, confusion, and eventual suicide attempts accompanied by long-term hospitalizations on psychiatric wards during his high school years. How I wish Joe had been a teenager in the era of Will and Grace. How I wish he had been taught Oscar Wilde and James Baldwin and E.M. Forster in his high school English classes. I even find myself wishing that my brother had been a teenager in the age of the internet. Joe didn't have a story that could help him make sense of his life. But just as a lack of stories can be dangerous, so can a multiplicity of stories, especially when we believe very firmly in those stories. Think what happens when stories of ongoing racial discrimination meet stories of white supremacy. Or when scientists explain how the actions of human beings are changing the climate, then they meet other people who claim climate change is God's way of hastening the end so that we may enter paradise more quickly. Stories are powerful. Stories portray, explore, and convey values. I originally hadn't planned to talk much about my personal story. I mean, I lived as a nun for 20 years, then I wrote about it for 10 years, and I sincerely hope I do not have to keep telling this story for the rest of my life. But karma is a bitch, and Pam told me, your story is unique, you have to tell it. Then when I asked her for a whiteboard for my simple presentation, she said, don't you want to share some of those great photos you have? We're going to spend what I hope will not seem to you like an inordinate amount of time telling my story. Then we'll talk a little bit about your stories, fictional stories, God stories, which are, of course, a sub-genre of fiction. And then I want to spend some time talking about American stories, because I think that's especially important. Today, before we move into any of these stories, though, I want to return to the most important part of this presentation. We've all had what the fuck moments. Moments when you heard or experienced or saw something that caused such a visceral reaction of shock, disbelief, or consternation. That you set aside all rules of public decency and said either aloud or to yourself or to the person next to you or to your television or phone screen, what the fuck? Right now, I want everyone to think about a recent or not so recent what the fuck moment in your own life. For some of us, those moments might have involved a family member, a church, a mosque, an election, something you read on the internet. Something that you couldn't immediately make sense of. A moment when you felt something resembling an electric shock. Can everyone think of a moment like that? Now, I'd like to hear about those moments from all of you, but that's not possible today. So, these are my requirements. I'll hear from four of you, but only with these conditions. If you can speak really loudly from where you are. And only if you can speak really loudly from where you are. If you can tell us about your what the fuck moment in three sentences or less. A beginning, a middle, and an end, if required. Perhaps your WTF moment will not even require an entire sentence. If you are brave enough to tell us about your WTF moment, we will all appreciate it. But, the one who tells it in the least amount of time is the one who will get a free copy of my book when I sign books at noon today. Brian is going to keep the stopwatch. And the lights are a little hard, but I'm going to try to see who are the first four people who raise your hands. One, two, three, four. I don't know if you were first, but you're the ones I saw first. Okay, so in that order, stand up. Number one, very loudly. Brian, you got your stopwatch going? Let's go. This is the last presidential election. Number two. Number two. I'm David, and I want to say that I have to send eight kids on the way here to the doctor, because he actually asked me if I was naked. I would like to see that. Yeah. Number three. Trump. Number three. Number four. The people paying to get into the creationist or park museum. Yeah, and I think number five over here was actually number two or three or something. Somebody already said it, Donald Trump. I think we're all going to agree on that one. So, Brian, who is the one who said it shortest? Number three. Number three over here with Trump, come see me afterwards. Yeah, we've all had those moments. We've all had those moments. And now I want something similar. I want some participation. What are the characteristics of those moments? What did they feel like to you, whether it was Trump, whether it was I am clearly labeled an atheist, yet still you don't believe me, or whatever it was in your life? For example, I will say that one of the characteristics is that this event is probably something that I was not consciously expecting. It was a surprise. Anybody else with a loud voice who can think of another element common to what the fuck moments? Yes? Yes, please, quickly. Okay. What's common is that it challenges everything. It challenges what you thought you knew up to that point. It does. It challenges what you thought you knew. It challenges your story. Another characteristic? Disgust. Disgust. You have a certain amount of disgust. That doesn't accompany all what the fuck moments, but many of them are accompanied by disgust. And a front. It feels like an affront. Like it's slapping you in the face. It's slapping you in your body. It's slapping you in your heart. It's slapping you where you never thought. Where anybody was going to slap them or anything. The print. Depression. It can lead to depression. It's like, ahhh. And what can I do about this situation? And all kinds of, one more. They weren't the person I thought they were. One more. They weren't the person I thought they were. The person who's speaking to you is not the person you thought they were. Oh yeah, isn't that scary? These fuck the fuck moments when, oh my god. Yeah, okay. So. Okay. So, as we continue to think about stories and clashes between reality and stories, the story we had about the person we thought we knew, the story we had about the America we thought we knew, we're going to examine these what the fuck moments and going to look at those five different kinds of stories I promised you. And there's no way to say everything that could be said about these kinds of stories. We'll touch on them briefly, and as I said, we're going to spend an inordinate time on the story of Mary Doctrine. We're going to talk about the story of Mary Johnson, but if you want more, you can always buy the book.",
