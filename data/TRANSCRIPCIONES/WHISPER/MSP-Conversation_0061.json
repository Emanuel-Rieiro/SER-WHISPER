    "text": " So Nafis, here we are. We're in some strange little room at Cambridge University waiting for our film, The Crisis of Civilisation, to finish playing so we can go in and do a Q&A. And I thought I'd just snatch a few moments with you just to talk to you a little bit about some of the things that are going on in the world right now. So maybe we could just start by saying, maybe we could just start talking a little bit about the situation in Syria. Okay, well, that's a big question. I mean, obviously, it's pretty clear that things are really kicking off at the moment as we speak. There's a lot of violence. There's lots of reports of civilians being killed in bomb attacks, as well as violence from rebel groups as well. So it's pretty clear that the situation in Syria is just deteriorating. But I think... Unfortunately... The problem with the way that the debate has been framed about Syria is that it's very one-sided. It's kind of like the Assad regime is rightly being criticised for its very, very brutal response to what's happening on the ground and the mobilisation of rebel forces. And we're seeing innocent civilians. Hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed. And others... Thousands have been injured and seriously injured. And there's a lot... It's indiscriminate and it's brutal. But the problem with the way it's been framed is that this is being used as a kind of a carte blanche to call for military intervention. Or some kind of increased intervention from the Western powers in order to remove and topple the Assad regime. I don't know what to say. Okay. So this is like an a cappella group. They've just come past us at Cambridge. They're about to do a load of singing in this strange little room. And so now for the background of the rest of this interview with Nafis, you'll hear some sort of Cambridge a cappella singing group. So anyway, you were saying that the debate was being framed around, you know, being used as a pretext for intervention. Yeah, I think it's a mistake to... To... To... I think the international community's response, which has been to kind of look at what's happening in Syria as something which we should think about intervening in, either militarily or through sanctions or whatever. I understand that. But I think it's definitely a mistake for activists to kind of fall into this line that a military intervention is the way forward and is the way to basically deal with the problem in Syria. Because it looks... It doesn't look at the complexities of what's happening. And one of the issues that is very, very difficult is the fact that who is arming and training the Syrian rebels? And where are they coming from? And who is actually responsible for a lot of the violence? And unfortunately, the way the mainstream media has been reporting this, it's as if the Assad regime has just suddenly gone crazy and is randomly killing people on the streets. What's happening is that, yes, there is a genuine... There is a genuine civil society movement in Syria that wants freedom and wants reform and wants political change. What's happened is that that movement has been hijacked by a minority of rebel groups who have started to use violence. And where did these groups come from? Well, it's a very interesting question, and it's quite a murky issue. Because what we're finding, as you look at the background to this, is that we have credible reports that the Saudis and the Qataris... ...have been plying them arms and have been financing the rebels. We have credible reports, and we know for a fact that people who have already been financed in Libya, part of the rebel movement... ...people who had... So, for example, the head of the Libyan Transitional Military Council, Abdul Hakim... I can't remember his surname, a guy called Abdul Hakim, basically. He was actually affiliated to the Islamic Front. He was part of the Islamic Front, which is a fighting group, which is an al-Qaeda network in Libya. Now, this guy has been in receipt of support from the Western powers as part of his position. This guy was consulting with the Syrians, with elements of the Syrian rebel movement, in terms of how they should basically carry out operations. We know that the Turks have also been conducting some kind of training exercises. And there's been quite... We have credible reports from sources like Debka File, which is an Israeli intelligence, private intelligence outlet... ...which has been confirming that the United States and Britain and various regional powers like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar... ...have been providing training, have been... British special forces are on the ground in Jordan, on the border, and have been actually providing hands-off advice... ...as to how these guys should carry out operations. So there is a very concerted effort from behind the scenes on the part of certain elements of the military intelligence community in the West... ...specifically Britain and America, allying themselves with these key regional powers... ...which are trying to kind of push forward the most virulent elements of the rebel movement... ...who basically are very... ...a kind of extremist... ...a kind of extremist... ...extremist Sunni factions linked with... ...with some of them with affiliations to Al-Qaeda and also affiliations to, as we can see, rebel groups that have already been armed by the United States. I mean, apparently there was one report from Asia Times that... ...and elsewhere as well, that Turkey had actually airlifted volunteers from Libya into Syria in order to kind of support the rebel movement. And, you know, we've had reports about jihadists from Iraq flooding in. So, I mean, now there's kind of an acknowledgement of this. Recently, even Hillary Clinton came out and acknowledged just a couple of days ago that elements of Al-Qaeda are actually... ...and, you know, Hamas and some other groups are actually involved also in the Syrian rebel movement. So there's some element here of the civilian government now becoming aware that this is clearly... ...not a good thing and they're slightly worried about it and have made public statements about it. The question that we need to be asking ourselves is why is it that elements of the secret national security apparatus... ...has been basically facilitating these kind of operations and facilitating these very dodgy connections with extremist groups... ...who were supposed to be fighting in the war on terror. Why are they doing that under the noses of the civilian administration? What is the game plan? What is the goal? And I think that's really my concern about what's happening in Syria. That there is a desire to control the outcome. And there's an uncertainty as to what could happen. Because I think before Assad started to crack down on the protest movements in Syria... ...there was this uncertainty within the West about where this would go. As was the case with Libya. There was this uncertainty within the West about where this would go. There was uncertainty about where this would go. Qaddafi was basically one of our guys. He was a bastard, but he was one of our bastards. To quote, to paraphrase something Henry Kissinger said back in the 80s. But I think there was a decision that was made that something needs to be done to control the possible outcome... ...in case Qaddafi does become overwhelmed by the kind of popular movement and the rebel movement that was there. And that's when we started to see an influx of arms. And that's when we started to see an influx of arms. Into the rebel movement. And we started to see the support for the rebels accelerate even backed by NATO intervention. I think a different thing is happening in Syria. I think it's the same kind of concerns of Assad. We don't really like him that much. You know, he's kind of a bit of an ally of Iran. He's kind of supporting his beloved from behind the scenes. We don't really like him. He is a dictator. But at the same time, Syria is kind of stable. You know, why rock the boat too much? He's not that bad. You know, he's kind of like... We've been tolerating the fact that he exists and we've been tolerating his human rights abuses. We've still been supporting him with a police training, military training. So we have to remember, as much as we might not like Syria ostensibly, we have been propping up his regime with military support as well. So the question is, why have the tables turned? Why is there suddenly this desire to kind of pinpoint what's happening... beyond the kind of violence on the ground? And why are we supporting the rebel movement there if we were kind of happy with the status quo before? And I think that's because there is again an uncertainty about where this could lead. And there is a desire to try and calibrate the violence, to control it, and to be able to in that way control the possible outcome. I think they're not sure whether Assad will fall or whether the rebels might win. They're not really sure what might the outcome be. So the game plan... The other game plan is to kind of make sure you kind of have play off both sides until you kind of see where the conflict is going. I mean that's certainly one possibility. The other possibility is that there is a long-term game plan here which is linked to very neoconservative agendas. That's what I was going to... Just to quickly just to... I was going to say that you could almost say that what's shaping up here is... You look at Libya and you look at Syria. And you look actually what's been happening in Pakistan is a new form of foreign policy strategy which you could almost call the Obama doctrine. Which is very different to the Bush doctrine but it kind of seems to be almost trying to achieve the same aims. Yeah. It's very interesting that if you go back to shortly after 9-11, in fact even before 9-11, and you had the neocon kind of faction in the United States in the defense and security industry, who were basically... Quite openly calling for a series of direct interventions in large areas of the Middle East to reconfigure the whole region. And all of the countries that we're now looking at in terms of the prospect of either military intervention or there's a lot of chaos there in the United States seems to be covertly involved. We're looking at Iran, we're looking at Syria, we're looking at Libya. We've already had Iraq. We've got eyes on Lebanon. We've got Balochistan. All of these regions have actually come under... They've actually been named as regions that we should be intervening in by neocons. So it's kind of strange that we find a Democrat president pursuing a strategy of response to the Arab Spring which has ended up involving the United States somewhere or another in some of the very same countries that were highlighted by neocons as strategic regions we need to be targeting to reconfigure the whole region. So I think there is certainly a possibility that elements of the defense and security establishment are very concerned by what the Arab Spring might mean. That this is something that took them utterly by surprise and they want to control it in some way. And this is dovetailed, I think, with some of those neocon elements within the defense establishment who are proposing this idea that, look, at some point or another, in order to control it, we need to do something about it. And this is something that's happening. And I think that's what's happening. And we are going to have to reconfigure the power structures across the region in order to control events in the Middle East. We are going to have to intervene in these regions and really reconfigure the power structures across the region in order to benefit Israel and... And also benefit the United States and keep hegemony. Where does the UK fit into that? Well, the UK has always been, kind of, played a subsidiary role from a defense perspective to the United States going back to shortly after World War II.",
