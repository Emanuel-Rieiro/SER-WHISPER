    "text": " What do you hope to see more of in the feminist movement? I think just kind of like what I touched on earlier, which is those who consider themselves feminist finding themselves involved in other movements, not just focusing on the middle class white women's agenda, but all agendas. We have so many issues that need to be talked about and discussed and get active. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about those very, very complicated ideas of privilege and class and race and sexism and talk about it all. Right. Because women are part of every movement. Yeah. And so so really supporting all women. OK, well, that's amazing. Thank you so much. I'm so glad we got to do this. OK, we'll talk. See you later. Wow. Really amazing interview. So glad Kenzie did that. And thank you so much, Takesha, for your wise words. Yeah, thank you so much, Mackenzie. Really good job. And thank you for introducing us to Takesha, who is definitely my new BFF. And we do want to mention also that it is just the four of us in the studio today. Our sisters Bella and Mackenzie couldn't be here because they're off working hard at school and we miss them. But we're going to have a good discussion. We're going to start talking about intersectionality and kind of go off of Keisha's interview and talk about what it means for us in our podcast. What is intersectionality? Someone tell us. OK. So what intersectional feminism is, is it's a type of inclusive feminism that includes everybody. And rather than speaking from a white upper class, cisgender, heteronormative perspective, it speaks from all perspectives. And it was coined by Kimberly Crenshaw. And I think it was, you know, in relation to the fact that up until that point, feminism had been very white. And the voice, like the main voice that was being heard was this white upper class feminist voice. So what Kimberly Crenshaw said was that intersectional feminism is the view that women experience oppression in varying configurations and in varying degrees of intensity. Cultural patterns. Patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society. Examples of this include race, gender, class, ability and ethnicity. So why do we want to talk about this today now that we've kind of defined it for everybody? Well, we were talking about this before we started the podcast, but feminism also like issues in the movement are not just, you know, gender. That's not like a static issue in the movement. Like racism. Racism also plays a role in feminism. So kind of when you're taking this in an intersectional framework, you realize how different aspects of people's identities privilege them and oppress them. And those need to be acknowledged. We're going to talk later about checking your privilege. But kind of what Shelby was saying, we can't make blanket statements about about women's experiences because they're all different. So you can have, for example, class privilege. Privilege. You can have heterosexual privilege, you know. So there's a lot of a lot of factors that need to be considered in the movement. And it's really important for us to talk about them and acknowledge your own privilege so you can leverage that privilege to help other people and be an ally. Yeah. And I think another reason why we wanted to talk about this today is that when you are doing something like this, like hosting a podcast and you're claiming it's about feminism. We really want to make sure we are being an inclusive, inclusive podcast. And, you know, we really can't say we have a feminist podcast if it's going to be from only one perspective. So that's just something that we have been thinking about a lot. But also with, you know, sometimes it's easy to not talk about these issues because that's, you know, the easier thing to do sometimes. Or you might not feel like you're. The most knowledgeable person on that topic. But by not talking about them, you're almost erasing them. So we'd rather talk about it and and maybe get it wrong sometimes and apologize when we do and learn from our mistakes than not talk about it at all. It's definitely hard. But we're I think it's yeah, it's OK to make mistakes and to learn from them. And we're definitely just trying to make sure dialogue is opened up and that we are not silenced by. Our fear of getting things wrong. And at the same time, not silencing others. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And truly, you know, we are all white and we've been thinking about this a lot in our past podcasts. Sometimes we didn't want to bring up race and sometimes we did just because we do feel like we have a privilege. And sometimes it's impossible for us to bring in the points of views of other races and classes, etc. So it's just good for us to start this discussion. Yeah, definitely. And because we're talking about, yeah, quote unquote, women's issues. Like, for example, we will talk about sexual violence and we'll talk about the wage gap and we'll talk about periods. And it's always important to acknowledge that there's so many different ways these issues can be experienced. Right. Like, for example, sexual violence is like felt harder in communities of black women and in communities of trans women. And for example, trans women don't get their periods. And so if we're talking about periods and that that's not mentioned, then that's not intersectional feminism. That is just one perspective. And that is that's not the full picture. And we always want to be giving the full picture. Yeah, definitely. Not all women are feel misogyny equally. Exactly. I wanted to talk a little bit about what's going on in the feminist community right now and particularly something that I'm really excited about. What is going on in the young feminist community? Because what I think is really cool is that a lot of young people are starting these conversations because of things like the Internet and just because we're younger. And so we haven't lived for that as long in the white feminist society. And so, quote unquote, third wave feminism. And so I think that intersectional feminism is supposedly one of its core values is intersectionality. And I really agree with that. And I think I see a lot of cool young people who are making this a priority. And the main one which got like a ton of talk about was the 13 year old Disney star who posted an essay on Tumblr and Instagram, which is like really cool about intersectional feminism. And she basically, yeah, she defined it for people who don't know. And she talks about the importance of. Um. Yeah. You know, the importance of talking about things like racism and Black Lives Matter and police brutality as feminist issues and also talking about trans issues as feminist issues. So it's a really good essay. I really recommend you check it out if you haven't seen it before. What's her name? Her name's Rowan Blanchard. Awesome. Thanks for asking. I feel like that's something that young feminists get criticized with often is just like posting a Facebook status or an Instagram photo or whatever about. Do they? Um. Yeah. You know. Um. Um. Uh. I. I think as a woman\u6211\u662f. Yes. I feel like I we I mean we all have um found so many spaces in uh on the internet just with different feminist blogs we follow or even like pages on Facebook that we like where we're constantly seeing a variety of opinions that help you create and mold your own like from the most radical to the most white feminist to the most you know it's like and then you kind of read all these opinions and you're like these are ones I agree with these are ones I don't agree with and it's a great like learning moment yeah some are things that you never even thought of before yeah kiss I better wash my mouth out with soap god I wish I never spoke now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap I feel it coming on my throat kiss I better wash my mouth out with soap god I wish I never spoke now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap so what are some of the things that we're really trying to consider now as feminists putting out a feminist podcast um well yeah I think the first one kind of going off what Bianca was just talking about is um I think the first one is um I think the first one is um I think the first one is um is to listen and not get defensive if you're trying to be an intersectional feminist um I think that's number one and so we have this podcast and it's been a learning it's been a learning opportunity for all of us and we'll get well you know we're constantly engaging we're engaging with people that we've never been engaging with before when you put something out there in the world you get feedback that is what we've learned and um it's awesome and we're learning to listen to the feedback and not get defensive and we're learning to listen to the feedback and not get defensive and we're learning to listen to the feedback and not get defensive not say but we do this but oh but this is what we really meant and so on and so forth and by not doing that you're opening up a dialogue because if you listen to someone and if you don't let yourself get defensive then you have the opportunity to learn and through that we've learned so much which is really cool um something that Claire was just telling me was that um something to consider is that intent is often irrelevant and I think that's a really good point so if you say something that you're not going to listen to then you're not going to listen to it something offensive um and someone calls you on it I think it's easy to be like but you don't understand I'm not really racist um because what I meant is so on and so forth and that's often not helpful what is helpful is to acknowledge that what you said was harmful and it was offensive and it was like potentially oppressive language whether or not you meant it that way is not the point I think the best way to move forward is to apologize learn from it and then hopefully move on um so that's one of the things that we consider when we're putting out this podcast and when you're feeling defensive too just to like personally reflect and be like why am I feeling so defensive is really important because if you think about it those feelings of being defensive kind of like reinforces the system you're protecting your position you're defending your position in the system right and when other people are gaining power like women women of color that's not supposed to be like you know making your power go away you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not supposed to be like you're not It's just bringing them up to where we're all supposed to be you know so we don't want to keep perpetuating the system we want to break it down mm-hmm right oh oh hey go go go good bye bye oh go bye bye um so another thing that we've been talking about that we think is a good thing to consider is checking your privilege and self-reflecting and what does that even really mean I guess is that really looking at your own identity and thinking about your class sex gender and sexuality and thinking about the ways that you have been privileged in certain areas of your identity or maybe oppressed in others and how those interact to form the way that you are able to live in society basically like when I think about checking my own privilege it's about being able to maybe do something that I know that I'm not going to get pulled over for by a cop or walking through certain areas and not being afraid that a white male cop is going to pull me over just because I'm a black male inhabiting the space so those are ways that I just think about that my life is easy to be a black male and I'm not going to be a white male and I'm not going to be a black male and I'm not going to be a white male and I'm not going to be a white male and I'm not going to be a black male and I'm not going to be a white male and I'm not going to be a white male and I'm not going to be a black male than other people's on a day to day basis and that's really easy to ignore it's really easy to just pave your way through life without even thinking about those or like we've been saying be defensive about them like especially with class I feel like people really feel like they have like earned something or like well I've worked really hard to be where I am and you know while that is you know sure maybe parts of that is valid honestly i'm gonna call bs though because everyone's out here working hard like it's like what i don't really understand how anyone's like working harder than anyone else we're all working hard but you got to start yeah 300 steps ahead exactly maybe where someone else got to start yeah and you might get to end at a much higher place because of where you started so exactly",
