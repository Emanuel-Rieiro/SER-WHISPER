    "text": " Welcome to Generation Fangirl. You were born in the 80s. And you were born in the 90s. And together we talk about trading cards you could only get at midnight releases, adorable frog cabbage creatures, and everything in between. Were you surprised that I had to talk about the best voice? They're both very specific, but I love them both. I saw a tweet about somebody that went to go see this movie with their mom, and their mom couldn't remember any of the Pokemon, but she liked the onion baby. If our podcast could only be dedicated to Bulbasaur, I would live a long, happy life. That would be content for me. You just made me realize that I am the only one who has been consistently drinking through every episode. I just never wanted to say it, and then it just became a thing, and I thought it was adorable. And I was like... Oh my god. Oh my god. I've never felt so called out, and yet... Like... I'm still sitting here. I've got my champagne and my orange juice on the desk with me, because of course I'm going to have a refill. But now it's too late for me to turn back and take it to the kitchen, so this is just the... This drink is straight out of... No, it's just like we always set up, and then I always have my energy drink so that I can power through this at optimal speed. Oh my god. And then you're like, I got my wine, and I'm like... The youth... Oh my god. The youth... I'm jealous. I didn't know you had to have an energy drink for everyone. This is a very exclusive... I've got an energy drink to be awake. An exclusive sneak peek behind the scenes at Generation Fangirl HQ. No, this will never be... In our very spacious offices with all of our recording booths. I think it's very obvious that we're not in the same room. It's fine. It's okay, because I think only like you, me, and maybe a robot listens to this podcast. So it's okay. But that's fine. I just like to have it for my records. So then later when I'm older, I can look back and say, look, I did have some friends. Jeez. So guess what I did this morning? What? After I woke up at like 10.30. Wait, did you watch the entire movie? I watched most of the beginning, and then I fast-forwarded to the end, because I really wanted context. Because I love Mewtwo. So anyway. I have not watched that movie since... Right? I think... So I was thinking as I started watching it, I'm like, man, we should do an episode about this. But not... I think just doing one movie would be a lot. But we could do the first three Pokemon movies, and just we could re-watch them and then talk about them or something. I think that would be really fun. Yeah, because I've only seen the one with Mewtwo and the one with the legendary birds. Okay, that's one and two. That's it. Yeah. The third one is like 20 of them. Yeah, there are a lot. I own the first five. Because the first five are really good. I haven't watched the other ones. But there's like Pokemon... Pokemon... The first movie, Pokemon 2000, the second movie, with the birds. Pokemon 3, which has Entei in it. Pokemon 4, aka Pokemon Forever, which has Celebi in it. And there's like time travel. And then there's Pokemon 5, which has Latios and Latias in it. The other legendary birds. They're not really birds. They're kind of like weird, smooth dolphins that can fly. The smooth dolphins? As opposed to a rough dolphin? Yes. Which would also be known as a shark, perhaps? No, they're both smooth. Are sharks smooth? Yes. I think they're not sandpaper skin. I think you're wrong about that. I think you, the scientist, are incorrect. No! And my memories are right. Because I have definitely never touched a shark before. These are just my thoughts. So this is Generation Fangirl. Welcome. Oh my god. We're keeping everything in. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! That's charming. Anyway, today we are talking about Detective Pikachu. The newest in a long, long line of Pokemon movies. But the first live-action one, right? I'm excited. Yeah, which is, this is such a very bizarre. There's been a bunch of Pokemon movies since, you know, the 90s. But this is the first Pokemon movie kind of, you know, like this. So I felt really weird about it. at first but now that I've seen it I've been like this is the best when you when you say like this do you mean like like 3d animated like yeah like live action because it's like I don't know it's it it was just so I didn't know what to expect when it came to how everybody looked like the trailer came out and I think everybody I know a lot of people said that they were surprised at how like furry Pikachu looked yeah I think that's because we forget that it's supposed to be a mouse that he's not he's not he's not smooth like silicone yeah he's so I was like okay it's very realistic and we just because I don't know if you've seen so it's not like a brand new concept but there's definitely been artists out there that have made like fan art of realistic Pokemon and sometimes they're really cool looking and sometimes they're fine yeah sometimes and that's what this movie was yeah I remember I can't I can't recall if we talked about it when it was being announced in previous episodes but I definitely remember being creeped out at first that Pikachu okay not not necessarily that Pikachu was furry because I was like I love like furry little babies but the talking thing definitely threw me off and I was not on board for Ryan Reynolds's voice at the beginning mostly because um so Detective Pikachu the video game had come out pre-release and there was jokes that like Danny DeVito should voice Pikachu because he can be the the the dissonance between having cute Pikachu in a little hat and the gruff voice of Danny DeVito would work very well they're also both kind of like round and like chubby and short so I think that was in people's minds a lot um and when right when Ryan Reynolds was announced I was a little trepidatious about it because okay now Pikachu's Deadpool I guess but with when the second trailer came out or Pikachu like interacting with Tim the main character I was just like okay no this looks hilarious I'm totally on board for this yeah I and I I spoiler alert I really loved it obviously we saw it together you saw it it was your second time seeing it and my first time seeing it yeah and I almost spoiled it for you I know because I'm so used to you seeing movies before they like come out to the public because you're always like oh yeah I saw it like on Wednesday and I'm like it came out Friday anyways we caught Pikachu in a dream you know up till like since \uc774\ub7f0 quygestination\u304a\u524dcept\u043e\u0440\u0430 seen it but if Either Arm's \uc774 Quem \u0442\u044b \u0432 Alab Da Dead Bo screened it Tak curiosity we're reading that conversation not really being the consumer of that their own video but it it is MrDpaper's colder cartoon part upstairs sotto \u043e\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 pizza aqui Saturday and I had been traveling we were just walking around a comic palooza and and P&E was like so do you like that uh that what was it that guest appearance at the end of the cameo and I was like I don't know what you mean because I haven't seen it yet and her face just like clammed up and you were just like nothing and I honestly like oh well there's a cameo and I'm so glad that I had no idea at that time I was like I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that and I have no idea what context context that could possibly be in but um no it's really funny because I so when I saw it I saw it the Friday that it came out immediately after work and so I was already tired from work and I saw it at a movie theater that had a bar so I was like heck yeah I'm gonna have some have some booze and then like it's a very simple plot and yeah it's kind of predictable you know if you're over the age of like 12 but for some reason I just did not see that big twist at the incoming and I think it's just because I was so tired I was just like the entire entire third act is just wild and I'm just like whoa I was so glad that my co-workers hadn't seen it yet but I was like I went back to work and I was like I'm dying to talk with someone about this movie everyone needs to come see it with me and it took a while but I finally saw it a second time this past week you know I'm so tired of it and I'm like I'm so tired of it and I'm like I'm dying to talk with co-workers and during the whole third part I was kind of like side-eyeing them and just waiting and when yeah when it was revealed that oh like the pokemon could be infused with people um I was like looking at them and they hadn't an idea yet that didn't even like register with me I thought that Pikachu was just special I remember at one point like hitting your arm and being like wait a second and you turn you look at me like this little this little smirk like oh my god I'm so tired of it and I'm like I'm so tired of it and I'm like I'm so tired of it I'm like I don't know but yeah you figured it out like 10 seconds before it showed up on screen and I was like so good and right when it pans out when Tim is waiting for his dad and it pans out to the voice that you see Pikachu and then it pans over to Ryan Reynolds the big ending like reveal with the train ticket I turned and I looked at my co-workers and they were like like hand in their like head in their hands like like covering their face and they were like like covering their face like like covering their mouths like oh my god I can't believe I'm seeing this with my own eyes his dad Pikachu is dad I mean Pikachu was his dad the entire time Pikachu is dad it's so good they slowly looked at me as if I had betrayed them like oh god this movie's so good and then of course they texted our group chain like everyone go see detective Pikachu right now please like yes converted them but that was the most fun like bizarre well-kept little spoiler like fun spoiler I think I've seen in a while but it's also like not that surprising the third act is wild but Mewtwo does some really weird shit just in general that whole part is just but Mewtwo as a character we know he can it's just I don't we just know that he is unknowable and it's hard to understand all of his powers so watching it I was kind of like yeah this tracks um yep to go back to the whole dad reveal thing I think for me it's it's so weird because like you know they were obviously covering up Tim's dad's face and everything and all the flashbacks and all these like just instances where his character showed up he never saw his face it was like always from behind and I thought it was supposed to be because his dad's like secretly the villain or something I don't know why it just didn't occur to me like oh that's Ryan Reynolds yeah I thought I I pictured it more as like oh because Tim kind of had a difficult relationship with his dad like he didn't really like see him that much in his past so he kind of like maybe doesn't remember his face kind of thing I went for a more like metaphorical like oh it's like the mysterious dad detective figure but I should have like I thought that his character had already showed up and we just didn't know that it was the same guy and frankly we were hiding his face and then I was like what a fool I was also though with your with your little hint of like didn't you like that cameo I thought he would be revealed at the end but I had no fucking clue it would be Ryan Reynolds until their bodies like were or whatever until that was revealed and I was like wait holy shit it's in front of us this whole time what I also loved about this movie though like mystery wise seeing a second time was really fun because you get to see the funny and like kind of sad lines that Pikachu says like when they're talking with Mr. Mom he's like I push people away and then hate them for leaving yeah and like how he is talking with Tim lost relationship with his dad and he's like I bet if your dad were here now like he'd be so proud of you and all this stuff oh I'm weepy it's a it's good the second time around too yeah and it's hard to find movies like that these days because there's so many movies that I'm like oh I loved it but I have no desire to go see it again and this was because I saw it with you guys the second time the following day yeah I saw it on Friday and then I saw it on Saturday and that has been like never happened to me in in my adult life and so I was like oh yeah yeah no I'm very excited to watch all of this all over again it's very exciting this movie has like for for our generation also our generations it has multiple levels because like one I'll go see it I'm like this is a fun story I love seeing the world of Pokemon and stuff but then the second time I see it I can really focus on like taking in all the pretty visuals and even the opening shot seeing it for the town and you see pidgeys flying in the air and oh I almost cried both times and it was it was just great because I think because I know that like okay we're gonna get into the generational side of this oh yeah okay obviously we both played it when we were younger but I remember because this Pokemon came out in America when I actually was like nine ten years old it was like the first Game Boy game that I had like I got a Game Boy so that I could play Pokemon because it was it was huge it was a big deal everyone was talking about it and it was like all over the place and so like I remember playing that during the summer like I would go to I don't want to say it was like a summer camp or a daycare I don't know what it was but basically I just like got dropped off at like YMCA and then some like teenagers were just kind of watching over all of us but we were all outside and then it's like if you wanted to play soccer you could play soccer you could sit on the like picnic tables or whatever and so I would do that and just play Pokemon a good use of your time you're right yeah but I mean like I was a gamer yeah but I'm saying that is that like I played it like while I was outside like I was in like fields and woods and stuff and so yeah I I think for a lot of us that played it when we were younger we we always wanted to pretend that Pokemon were real that you could just walk into the woods and play Pokemon and stuff and so I think that's what I did and I think that's what I did and I think that's what I did and I think that's what I did and I think that's what I did and you can see some Caterpie or something and so to see that like presented to you on a big screen where it's just like a normal thing it's just like oh it's just a flock of pidgeys and you're just like oh my god they're beautiful even though they're just birds and I've always like loved the the coming of age storyline of okay now they're now they're 10 or 15 or whatever they're gonna go off and become Pokemon masters so it's just such a good and like like informative uh narrative for a lot of kids growing up um and seeing that first scene of Tim and his friend kind of like pulling him along and like hey we gotta go we're gonna go catch you a Pokemon um and the friend's like yeah so I'm leaving town soon I just want to make sure that you'll be okay and not lonely and his friend with the backpack and everything and how there's just a perfect like quintessential Pokemon trainer chic look that Lucy also wears later in the movie the reporter when she's in her red with her side up she is like she is such a Pokemon go trainer she's so that's exactly what she looks like and I think because that's another thing is that like I got this I guess mostly from the anime and stuff where it's like oh yeah in the Pokemon world when you're 10 years old you get to leave home and go be a Pokemon trainer which is like sounds cool when you're actually 10 but then when you're like 20 and you're looking back on it and you're like what 10 year old just goes off on their own to live in the wilderness and everyone's like oh my god I'm gonna be a Pokemon trainer okay with it it's a little nostalgic though like oh I wish I could have done that though yeah yeah but it's like it's so cool yeah it's just it's so cool to see like an environment where that is totally normal because I guess because the characters are older because I think I think Tim and his friends and everybody they're like in their 20s and so it kind of makes sense to be like hey you know I'm getting ready to leave town I'm gonna go get some Pokemon and I'm all packed up like they're out gonna go hiking you know they have all their stuff they got their hat and all their Pokeballs and I'm like this is awesome it it does frankly want like makes me want to be a little more active in my day-to-day life like hiking and shit but if Pokemon were out there I'd be like oh hell yeah um but I do okay it's hot outside yeah I went I I personally went out into nature this morning and it was great even though the temperature said that it was 70 degrees and it felt like a hundred and ten degrees and I was like oh boy oh boy here we go oh boy yeah but I I also like that they had a like older protagonists in this movie because I know the original detective Pikachu game uh I think it's like a I think he's like 11 or something but it's like a little kid looking for his dad um and it was fun to see a slightly older but still relatable to younger kids the protagonist but also still relatable to like older like I love that he's an insurance I was like oh man what a I was like oh it's like stabbed me right through the heart I was like what a mood he's just you know yeah I wanted to be trying to trying to he's taking care of himself yeah and and dealing with just living on his own and I feel like I I really enjoyed his character the protagonist I felt like he was very relatable and it wasn't super cliche it was kind of like oh yeah you know you look in his in his like childhood bedroom and stuff and it's like oh of course he was he loved Pokemon when he was 10 years old because he was 10 years old and it's like now he's 21 and he's like I gotta make money and just that was a fun thing that I used to do but you know but you also understand yeah I can understand how he's like kind of bitter about like well my dad wanted to hang out with Pokemon more than his own kid so I kind of am just like not really into Pokemon anymore and like okay I could get that watching it again you also like see I mean I got to see more hints of like oh this was his dream because his old childhood room is like plaster the one that his dad remade in the in rhyme setting and also his past one in flashbacks is like plastered with Pokemon battle posters and stuff like that and he looks at one in particular it's for like a specific Championship um also the poster said articuno versus Steelix and I looked at that and I was like articuno's a legendary bird is there only one who the is training articuno and putting it against a Steelix for the championships I'm like excuse me how is this Steelix is just like a rock right anyway so uh that was just my own little like articuno shouldn't be out there somewhere but anyway pushes up my glasses uh but I like that they showed all of the different posters and like how it really was like his thing as a kid and even when they were in the Pokemon battle with um the wizard and Pikachu's like when the sudden did you become a Pokemon trainer because he knew all of those moves and he knew exactly like how to direct it how to direct Pikachu's moves and stuff",
