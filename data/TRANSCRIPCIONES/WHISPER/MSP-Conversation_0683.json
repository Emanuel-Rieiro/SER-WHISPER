    "text": " the actresses playing this trio that Michael goes after are awful. They're really bad. They're not the best. But, like, and that's, like, the whole middle section of the movie. And it's really doing, like, very similar, like, the shots of them on the street and, like, taunting him in the school and, like, all that stuff. And I was just like, ugh, this is. But the beginning was so interesting. And then when it kind of, like, gets into gear, when they do start doing, like, babysitting and Michael, like, shows up, it does do different stuff. And then I thought it was good again. But then, again, that's when it was about, like, kind of Michael chasing everyone and being, like, a horror movie. The weird part about it is that for, like, okay, for Rob Zombie, the most important, you know, this was Michael's story. Like, he did such a great job on that. He went from a character who was literally known as The Shape because he had no name or whatever. Right. Which can be. Which can be very silly as a thing. Yeah. Especially when you get attached to whatever the sequels create him as, you know, retcon it and be like, oh, no, he was Michael and whatever. He was obsessed with the occult. I don't know. But in this movie, it was such a good job of developing him as an actual character. Like, you see, like, he goes on to the threshold of, like, possibly being rehabilitated and, like, isn't. And the most important thing for him was his family, but in the sense that his mother and his sister, Lori. Right. So he hated, you know, he hated his older sister because she was, like, mean to him and his stepdad was awful. So, like, all those people he killed or whatever. But his relationship with his mother was, like, so touching. Right. Like, he's not an emotionless, dark, like, shape. Yeah, exactly. He has some kind of empathy or feelings towards some people. Yeah. And she loves him. She loves him. Like, there's an amazing scene where he's in, like, a juvie mental place. And what? I don't know. Juvie mental place. I guess it's just a mental. He's just, like, a juvie in it. And he has the mask on and she, like, tells him to take it off because, you know, his face is beautiful and she, like, loves him. Yeah. Even though he has committed murders at this point. Right. She still approached him in this, like, really believable way. Yeah. It was so great. She brought him, you know, he loved his little. He loved his little sister, Lori. Right. Well, not to interrupt, but, like, this movie obviously incorporates the mythology that she's his sister into the first movie. Which is not part of the first movie of Halloween. So, I think it's interesting and kind of, like, interesting, but why? Why did you do this? Because she's so important to him. Like, why did he fail so hard at the Lori stuff? I don't know. Like, that actress, like, I think that, I don't know. Because I don't know his, if he has, like, actors that he works with all the time. No, she was the first one he saw or whatever. She, I think, was really good at the terror stuff. Okay. Like, when Michael was chasing her. Yeah. She got this role, I think, for being able to scream and do all that stuff, like, really effectively. I thought she was very good at that. But, like, the character, like, they just, well, like you had said, I think maybe just by making them these kind of boring, boring characters. Like, the midwestern girls now, like, they were just, were just non-entities to me. They were not, they didn't stand out in any way. And, like, so maybe by just watching, like, the 70s movies, these girls are, like, maybe they were just normal. But, like, to me, they're funny and weird. And, like, I just think they're distinct. Like, to me, they're all very, like, Lori in the first movie, she's shy and, like, sweet. This girl isn't really shy. She's, yeah. A wearing midwestern girl. Exactly. Not that she wore them. She's a little hyper. She's very hyper and strange. I couldn't understand what she was saying sometimes. She was very animated with her hands as well. And me, a little mean. She wears glasses. That's how you know she's different from her friends. Right. Otherwise, it's really hard to distinguish them. Right. I thought she was a little mean. Was she a little mean? She, like, the way she teased the kids and stuff was just, like, very. Maybe in a modern way, it's not as, like, mean. It was just, like, I don't know. Anyway. But. What else did we do, though? I was surprised at this one, I think. Yeah. Yeah. We were very surprised. Okay. I feel like we have so many more that were really good. Oh, well, okay. So, Brad Durff was in this movie. He was also in Child's Play. He was. And he had never seen that. And it's part of the Ovid that we had previously mentioned called Jarrow Hearts, which is about final girls and stuff. And I had never seen this movie. Somehow, I missed it in my youth. What a fun time. I agree. I agree. I agree. I don't know if I have a lot to, like, really. I'm pretty, like, you know, I never wanted to see it because I was like, it's a doll. I don't need this. Thanks. I mean, animated alive dolls are not great. I think I was more like, I just, this seems stupid and childish. So, I don't want to see it. But it was fun. But it was so much fun. And, yeah. So, Brad Durff, like, was this. Criminal who was also into the occult. Yeah. And when he was cornered by a cop in a toy store. Get the closest thing. Summoned some spiritual stuff. Yeah. Via lots of lightning and thunder. A bit of racist voodoo later or whatever. Later it's revealed to be a little bit racist. Anyway. And he entered his, transported his consciousness into this doll. Which reminds me of those. My buddy dolls from the 80s. Creepy. I wondered. I still didn't look into this very much. But they were so similar. Was it based on it? I don't know. Probably. Maybe it was just simultaneous. I mean, it's just, nobody shouldn't have these dolls. I had the sister. Dolls that look like humans that are, like, big. Nah. No. Nah. Anyway, I had fun watching this. And Annabelle, which we talked about. Yeah. So, yeah. Child's play was pretty fun. Yeah, I liked it. At the end of the day. And another thing that you thought was going to be childish. And silly. But wasn't at all. Was Poltergeist. Oh. My. Goodness. Which, for me. Poltergeist was one of those movies that, like. I feel like. I felt like I had seen. Because I had seen lots of bits of it. But I have never actually, until this year. Sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Like, so I was familiar with a lot of things about it. And obviously all the shit surrounding it. And, like, big famous scenes in it. But. But never actually watched it. This might be my favorite thing that we watched. I've only seen the part of Poltergeist where she's, like, in front of the TV. Obviously the They're Here thing. That's just so famous. And I only know this movie as the X-Files referenced it. Right. In Conduit. Sure. I think this was, like, season one. Really early. Really early. Like, episode four. Five or something. Like, a little boy sits in front of the TV. Gets messages from the aliens. Yeah. Like, oh, my God. Like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This movie surprised the hell out of me. And again, it's really hard. Like, what is it about nowadays movies that just, like, they don't spend enough time? It gets the emotional heart so right. Well, this is why when we've spoken in the past about, like, The Conjuring. Yeah. Great characters. Great family. It makes you care about the family. And at the heart of this movie are really great characters. Yeah. And obviously, there's a huge pedigree behind this movie. You have Toby Hooper, who's the director, and then Steven Spielberg as the producer, who some people say actually really directed it. And it's very Spielbergian. Like, very Spielbergian. Like, you can feel that, like, all over the place. So, I don't know. That's something I'd have to, like, read up on more myself. Yeah. But it's just, like, the core, like, family. And this, they're so great. So great. And, like, Craig T. Nelson and Jo Beth Williams as the parents. Oh, my gosh. She was so amazing. They were great. I literally turned at the end of the movie and I was like, I wish I had, like, Yuletide fic for them. Like, I should say. I was obsessed with them. I really enjoyed this movie. It's scary. It's so scary. It's good. And, like, the journey is so well done. And, like, their little girl gets... Sort of sucked into, like, a portal, whatever. And they can still hear her. And that's, like, horrible. Like, it's horrible. And you just see, like, how it affects these parents. Yeah. And also, like, the siblings. Like, the little boy at one point was, like, totally made into Fox Mulder. Right. Via, like, the paranormal that happened. Watching the crazy stuff. Yeah. It was just so... Just so well done because of the acting and the fact that it let these actors kind of be like, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So, like, they kind of, like, do their thing. Yeah. Um, yeah, I loved it. I loved it so much. Oh, my God. I can't believe I hadn't seen it, really. I just, like, thought that I had, but really hadn't. All the birth metaphors were so great. Like, I mean, I'm obviously, like, a sucker for any kind of, like, mama bear and kid issue. So, that being, like, central to it was obviously great. Obviously, there was, like, you know, that's, like, a gender thing where, like, obviously, like, mom and kids having, like, that emotional attachment and then, like, dad being, like, the one to he was he was the one that needed to yell that was such a good scene well yeah he like he's the one that well they were trying to to get the girl stuck who is stuck in the the weird like zone there um to not go towards this light situation and the dad being the one that is the one that usually like doles out punishments and things had to be like the stern like yelly guy um to get her to not do stuff obviously these are like typical gender like gender roles like for moms and dads but i i don't care because i love a mama bear like i know it's so cool like so the so these parents right so there's this scene of of them kind of like smoking weed yeah they're just real fun people they're they're really cute together they have a 16 year old daughter and a eight year eight year old son and a five year old daughter and then it's like revealed like after the girl was missing the youngest one uh that like the mom is like 32 so like she had the oldest one when she was 16 which i think like adds such an interesting layer to this like family i don't know it's really great everything was so well done yeah that's what happens when you have like such good people behind it and yeah acting in it and yeah the second one was like clearly not the second one was not great uh because they had to also well also racist not the best the point of the first movie was that there he works for this like company that builds um like a subdivision like suburbs yeah right and so the boss constantly like relocates cemeteries right but only moves the headstones so this whole subdivision was built upon a graveyard and uh skellingtons yeah which was a mistake let's yeah so um for the second one you did a uh a plot so underneath that graveyard further buried further buried more it was like a weird uh cult like like religious group from the 1800s that went west and uh sealed themselves in a tomb yeah and then there was a lot of like native american yeah like an evil an evil like white dude with teeth oh it was such a disappointment i mean i knew it wasn't going to be good because the first one was like a little bit of a mess but it was a good movie i mean i was so great but i just i really loved that family and i was like i want to spend more time with coach and his wife yeah and uh they're great and i still want fig for them if anybody wants to write me fig about yeah please do i'll read it i'll read it they're great uh yeah but i did like how in the second one it sort of the first one was kind of like the crux of it was like the the mom kind of had to the mom had to deal with with the kid you know and it was like her her she had to save her child yeah and the second one i thought was interesting that even though it was clearly not as good as a movie but like the dad gets sort of like possessed right via badness there's like this really intense scene with him kind of like attacking the mom right that was like really like whoa it went to places yeah um but it was not not at all as good it was terrible nah don't watch that one watch the first one yeah don't watch the remake um oh what else is on this list we kind of have gone through a bunch um uh i think another okay so maybe another big surprise in terms of contemporary horror that we watched uh was unfriended yeah that was fun uh-huh um that's the one that you may have seen if you haven't seen it you probably have a trailer for it it is the one that it takes place entirely over skype yeah um and it's sort of about this these group of friends who may or may not have posted a horrible video of this girl that led to this girl's death and she's like oh my god i'm killing herself um and she is now mysteriously appearing on skype to torment them as an internet ghost um and it was really cool yeah i thought it was really well done and really like timely um and like interesting um take like a horror take on like cyber bullying and and just like very unique way to make a film that's all on screen yeah it was have it be visually like interesting and still kind of kind of scary um i thought it was gonna be really stupid it just it showed it showed a lot of like really good like youth culture things like yeah it was all about like like you like i don't even understand because i think i still think that like video like talking over video is like something that you do on like star trek and that like i don't like it and i don't like talk i don't like facetime and skype because i don't need people looking at me and i don't like it and i don't like it and i don't like talking at me and this is this is my like get off my lawn thing like i'm just like it's such a like ubiquitous thing now and i'm like i don't want to do it i like it um but the the we're on like this girl's computer like kind of the main girl and um she has like 20 windows open she has like spotify she has you can see all this stuff yeah and which it which you know makes it wolf tab in her yeah oh my god it makes it believable um so she has her chrome open and then she has she has like um she has like a lot of like like like like like like like like like like like uh aim opens she's like talking via chat and then also skyping her boyfriend um and then like the whole group of friends start skyping uh but she constantly like goes on like youtube or and then facebook like literally all the things i don't know if it was aim it was some other thing well it was it was like apple instant messenger like i've definitely used it before that was what it looked like um so it was uh just i thought like all right i think that she should have been using a little bit more hot stuff and then she's like oh my god i don't know what to do with this um but she's like oh my god i don't know what to do with this um but she's like oh my god i don't know what to do with this ah like that was the most unbelievable part of this movie was a little bit too much like copy paste you know like it would be a little bit faster right you had to visually yeah you had to kind of show exactly exactly so visual uh but that says something that that's the most like weird part for me everything else was like okay unbelievable yeah um but yeah they did a really good job yeah that was a good surprise um that's my favorite part of the movie um i don't know if you guys have any other questions most of the stuff that we watched uh there's only two more on this list i think that we haven't really talked about in previous episodes yeah um one being the west craven film deadly blessing oh man that thing's so weird no it was the weirdest it's the um it takes place in like amish country and but they're not really amish again they're like some other thing amish like and community it has ernest borg nine in it as one of these were and then like a really really really tiny sharon stone yeah and oh man it just doesn't make it it's sharon stone weirdest thing ever but it had like these really fun moments in it but like it was just something okay you should explain it to kill people i won't explain it you have to explain i don't know i even know how you have to explain the crux of that movie i don't remember how you're gonna have to do it um the incubus was a a warning that was constantly thrown around by these like faux amish people and they kept like pointing fingers at this girl she was married to a guy who kind of like uh was this amish guy and then he like left so and everybody shunned him because that's what you do but they still like live on the land like surrounded by these amish people right um so he gets killed via some kind of accident with a truck and he's like oh my god i'm gonna die tractor right um and his like wife who is pregnant yeah does not want to leave she's like she's a normal she's like uh she's not amish so she's she's like this is my house and i'm living here for reasons unbeknownst to me because there's crazy stuff yeah and her friends sharon stone and and a cool other one who i loved yeah come there and they're all like from the city and they're like instead of like let's go back to the city where you belong they're like no we're gonna stay with you and like you know work on your land oh my god um oh no then there's also like this woman who's like a nurse she's weird and she has a daughter right who's also weird and it turns out to be very important she kind of like hits on this woman who refuses to leave the land and that's kind of i was like i'm into this yeah for like an old ass movie it was like okay i got some like uh les action yeah then people start getting murdered so sharon stone oh my god she's just attacked by so many spiders is very not into spiders i'm afraid of spiders that was really fun watching vera watch that part i literally could not watch it dude sharon stone is like in a barn and she's like a city girl and she's freaking sharon stone you can imagine it yeah she's all like she had been in before this but she was like really it's pretty brand new i think i think yeah she's a baby basically and um she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like she's like um so she's in this barn and it's like oh no i think she's being like chased so she like runs up the barn and like oh man cobwebs everywhere she goes through them yeah oh man spiders like oh it was just so like visceral to me great i just could feel those cobwebs on my face like it was and she kept dreaming about spiders like going into her mouth it was just awful",
