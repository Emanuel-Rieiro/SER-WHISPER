    "text": " With that, it's time for New Beginnings, which is a time of the week when we chat to people who've made some kind of change in their lives or embarked on a new adventure, some kind of new project. Some are made a fresh start, be it in the personal sphere, professional or otherwise. And in today's case, it's really a bit of all of the above in a way, because one of my guests is Monique Stradham, who you will know we've interviewed many times before, a woman who survived an extended hijacking ordeal in the Philippines and came home determined to change her own life and spend it making a difference in the lives of others. And on her return to South Africa, she closed down her business. She founded two charitable trusts and now devotes her time to helping those in need and mobilizing other people to help people and to make a difference. Monique, always lovely to have you. Thank you. Always nice to be here. Now, over the past year or so, we've spoken several times to Monique about the work being done with abused children via Matlabana. But today, specifically, we want to focus on a new pilot project that they rolled out towards the end of last year. And this is where my second guest comes in. A very warm welcome to Indi Zakade, who is part of that project's pilot phase during last year's 16 Days of Activism campaign. Lovely to have you as well. Thank you very much. Where do we start, Monique? Maybe you can summarize. Come up for us, first of all, what this project was all about and how it came about. Yes, it really came from the people. We did a marketing research project with University of Johannesburg two years ago with their marketing students. And we asked them to find out why kids are not reporting abuse. And then they came back and they said it's because society is not speaking about abuse. And they were so taken with the project that they decided to develop some creatives for us. And this project, and I want to ask Indi to give the name of this project because she does it properly. It is Mata'a Baana. And the project's called? Getting Conversation Going. From Mamnani's. Sorry. Ah, there we are. Mamnani's, yes. Mamnani. Mamnani's, all right. And it's all about mobilizing ladies in the community, ladies that people have respect for, to go out and to start speaking to the people in their own communities about abuse. It's quite, what's the word I'm looking for? It's quite well-timed that we're having this conversation today when previously we've been talking about, the mayor saying, hey, we need to talk more about racism in Cape Town. It's the same theme coming that these problems exist, they are there, and we are not doing enough to talk about them and be open about them in our society. Absolutely. You know, and we've just found since we've started this project, and it's called Getting Conversation Going, the overall project, how many people have come to us and said, please, we want to get involved and we want to help because we feel like you feel, but the reality is people don't speak about it. You know, something happens to somebody's child and they rather keep quiet. Because they think it's a big shame, but it's not a big shame. You know, the shame is on the perpetrator, not on the people that it happened to. Yeah, such an important point to make. You launched it, obviously, during the 16 Days of Activism Against Violence Against Women and Children, where it is a time of the year where obviously we made and reminded, made aware of and reminded of the stats. Let's maybe paint the picture. I mean, it's something like three quarters of abuse victims in South Africa suffer at the hands of somebody that they know, a family member or a friend of the family, for example. Yes. 80% of the perpetrators are known to the victim. That's right. And it's often in their own homes. Okay. So the idea was start the conversation, have somebody who is a respected figure in the community initiate the conversation. How did you make that happen? Indy, you were one of those women here in Cape Town. I know there were three of you. What did you do? Yes, it was very interesting because we took a ride in the Texas, encouraging people to talk about things that are happening in our communities, like reporting cases that are happening. Because we're talking about four types of abuse, that we've got neglect that is happening in our communities, child physical abuse. We've got emotional abuse, that one needs to report when they see things that are happening in their communities. We encourage people, we encouraged people on Texas so that they can talk about things that are happening in their communities. So they were talking about things that are happening, so they were scared to say if I'm going to report my neighbour, I'm just breaking up their families, but we're encouraged, let us talk about it. And the thing, that are noticing our rights. Most men were talking about things that are happening in our communities. And they said a lot of things. Most of the time, people are like they don't take them seriously when things happen to them because they were very concerned. I said, good, this project is getting everybody talking. Men issues, children's issues, let us get about things that are happening in our communities because this community is our community together. So we need to work together, men, women, and children. Let us work together and talk about things that are happening in our communities. I love that you mentioned that the men were involved in the conversation because often I think they feel excluded from the conversation. I often receive that SMS or email during the 16 days particularly from men saying this whole idea is unfair. It stigmatizes all men as abusers, and I feel excluded from this campaign. So you say to me the people you were talking with were not only women. It was men as well. Yes, there were men also. They also mentioned that when they take matters to police station, they normally get discriminated. But I say nevertheless, they need to continue on what they're doing. It's right because abuse is abuse. It's either a man or a woman or a child. It is abuse. We need to report the matters that is happening in our communities. Now, you've mentioned the comment somebody made that if I report my neighbor, I might break up their family. What were some of the other fears people expressed to you or concerns they had? I want to hear. I don't want to use the word excuses, but there are reasons for not reporting abuse when they did see it. Yes, there were other things people were talking about is when you report, so the neighbors no longer talk to you. Then the neighbors, they kind of exclude you now. They say you mustn't talk to this one who will take things, your matters, like the things of the home, will take it out to the street. But you feel like isolated when you take matters seriously. So people, they won't like to surround themselves. So people, they won't like to surround themselves. But they won't like to surround themselves. So people, they won't like to surround themselves. But it is the right thing that once need to see. When you see things happening, you need to report them. What about the sense that some people have that this doesn't happen in my community, that abuse is something that happens to other people and not in my home or not in my community? Did you encounter that at all? Yes. Yeah, there were some rights like that. When you get into the taxi, like when you start to talk about the abuse, it kind of goes, no, don't talk about this. This is not happening to me. This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. But when you, when you continue speaking to people, you kind of see good people, they are lightening up. They will see good things, really things happening in our communities. Because other people will say, let's talk about this. At first, they don't want to take you seriously. No, no, no, you were just wasting my time. But when you consistently talking to them, you get at you reaching out to them. If we ever need an example of the fact that abuse happens everywhere, we have it today coming out of the court in Palm Ridge, by the way, in case you haven't yet heard. Our former Grand Slam tennis champion, Bob Hewitt, convicted on two counts of rape and one of sexual assault, just before we came to air today. That, I mean, that, that I think illustrates for me so effectively that this is a problem that is happening in your community. You might not think so. Monique, is that a stigma that you have to work very hard to overcome? The sense of not in my backyard? Yes, absolutely. Especially with white people. You know, we get white people who say it doesn't happen here. But the reality is last year, the first three months of the year, we helped six cases. We helped six cases where it was white people, graduated people, people in a high-income group where the father's abused. I think four of the cases were the father's and two, the boyfriend, the mother's boyfriend or the stepfather. So it really, you know, we say rape doesn't know or abuse doesn't know, doesn't know sex, it doesn't know race, you know, it doesn't know gender. It really happens everywhere. And, you know, with all the pornography cases coming out now, you know, in PE East London, Sasselburg, these are all, people who have jobs and some of them use their job emails to get the images and they have money and they are respected members of the community. So it's just a perpetrator on a completely different level that you would find in another society. So don't say it doesn't happen in my society because then you need to start talking because you don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. I mean, how did you, you've said how some people said, I don't want to have this conversation with you on a taxi. How do people react to your very presence there? The idea of, I'm boarding this taxi with you specifically to have this conversation. Did they find it very strange? Yes. At first it was very, very, very strange when you get into the taxi and say, please people let us talk about this. At some stage people can skip quite for a long time. But when you get on and talk about it, they listen. Then some started to ask questions. If this thing that is happening next door, what must I do now? Because there is this case that is happening at my, my neighbor, but this woman don't see this. Every time this child has got, he's acting in a strange way. But if you, if you consistently talk, talking about this, then people, they get note and they talk to and talk to you. You can find most of the time that people that are not talking are the ones that's got like, yes, yeah, that got burdened on their side. Because they don't, they don't want to accept that things are happening in my surrounding. Hmm. Very interesting. Uh, how did you actually prepare for going out? I mean, I'm sure you didn't just jump onto a taxi and merely take a ride. Well, what went into planning for this project? At first I just introduced myself to the, uh, Monique's did he introduced that there will be riding on the Texas, but it was such as created the, the, the, the, the, the, I just created the, the, the, the friendly environment with their Texas drivers. Just to ask them, good. I will be in the taxi. I will be doing this so that I can get their support also. And one thing that I loved with the Texas driver. They, they were encouraging and they were talking and they were asking question that says good. People are really concerned about this, about things that are happening in their communities. I would like to say thumbs up to the taxi drivers because they did engage with us and supported us.",
