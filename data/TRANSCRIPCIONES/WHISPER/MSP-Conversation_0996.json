    "text": " So I had got two children and four grandkids. And I worked right through the career. I took six weeks off for Aaron because that's what was allowed. And I took six weeks off for Andrew because that's what was allowed. And that was pretty much it. But the first time, you know, once again, the guys didn't think I was coming back. So to prove to them, of course, I worked through that six weeks, which is nuts. You shouldn't be doing that. But that was way back when. Fast forward. It's imperative you have lots of people around you. You need a team of people. We had child care for the kids. Either somebody coming in or the child went out. We did that. And you learn to use parents if you can and babysitters and whatnot. The other thing, and I'm not a great cook. My ex-husband was a great cook, so that was terrific. He did the cooking. I traveled around the world, and he would always make sure the dinner was on the table for the children, which was great. So you need partnerships with whomever you're a partner with, and that could be very broad, but you really need a team of people. I have told people over time, you know, I mean, I remember the time Uber wasn't around. I remember the time that I had to hire a taxi cab driver to take my daughter, our daughter, to tennis lessons. I mean, I interviewed taxi cab drivers. How bad is that? But that's what you did. I mean, you did what you had to do back then. And the kids are both great. They're great because of it. It's very funny. I've asked both Aaron and Andrew whether or not they regret that I had this career, and did I neglect them at all? And they had wonderful opportunities because of the career, okay, because every now and then I'd take them places. But Aaron said, the only thing I regret, Mom, is that you were not home at 3.30 when I came home from school because at 3.30, everything is really important to them, right? I'm working. And so moral of the story is if you've got kids coming home at 3.30, you better be sure you're calling them, texting them, phoning them, or whatever so that they can unload to you what's the most important thing in their life, which was right there at 3.30. Because I wasn't at home until 6 or 6.30, so it was old news then. So anyway, you can do it. You need to set your priorities, what's most important to you. If you've got elderly parents, you've got to focus in on them. You've got to focus in on the kids. And hopefully you're working in an environment, in a culture that's very supportive of women and working women with families. So that was my story. Awesome. So I still have, obviously, to this day, I reflect back on some things that being a working mom, I felt guilty when I was at work, and then I felt guilty when I was at home, and it was like, oh, my God, this guilt. And I'm going to just share one little story that to this day, I could just shrink right into a little ball when I think about what I did. So I worked a lot of hours. I had a spouse that was able to be home more than I was. But this was when I was trying to learn, you know, what it meant to capitalize your company. If you're going to raise money, I mean, you sold equity. Well, what was my company worth and all of that? Well, there was a Bill Linton who founded ProMega, said, Jan, I'll come over to your office, and we'll work this out together. But he couldn't come until, like, 7 o'clock at night. Well, I took my little girl with me at that time, and she was, you know, writing all over the whiteboard and having fun, and we're talking and talking. The next thing I look, she's asleep on the floor in front of the whiteboard, and it's 930 at night. Oh, my God, you guys, I could cry just thinking about it. But I have to tell you something. There were other things that I did and opportunities that I was able to provide, that I wouldn't have been able to give her otherwise. In the scheme of life, it's not always an even, balanced scale. There are going to be demands on you and sacrifices you have to make, and only you know which direction that scale needs to go at that moment. You know, I was very fortunate that I could also set, set the groundwork, set the culture for my company, and we were very family-oriented. But at the time, it required me, the leader. And because I didn't know anything, I had to put in all this extra time to learn and prepare. I over-prepared for everything, because I didn't want to embarrass myself or my company by looking like an idiot. So that required a lot of extra time. And I was very fortunate that, you know, I had a lot of time on my part. And even after the kids were in bed at night, I'd be up late. I remember one, you know, talk about being knocked off your pedestal. So I had just closed our first round of funding with Venture Investors. We were the first company they ever invested in, by the way. This was in 1984, I think. And I, you know, I just deposited the check in the bank account, and I pull home. The garage door goes up. I pull in. I am good. I get out of that car door. I open the door into the house. There's my daughter standing there in tears. Mommy, I don't have any clean underpants. And I went, you know what? She's right. This is what life, this is what's really important, right? So those are the roles that you fill in life. And it's not always going to be even. Don't expect it to be. And forgive yourself when it isn't. Because you're not going to be able to do it. You're not going to be able to do it. You're not going to be able to do it. Because you're not going to be able to do it. And you're not going to be able to do it. And you're not going to be able to do it. Because in the end, all you can do is your best. I'll just add that. So I'm, full disclosure, not married. And I don't have children. And I think the dynamic of that is that in the workplace, people can think that you actually have unlimited time to work. Right? So it's like, oh, well, of course you can go to XXXXX. Or of course you actually want to take on more projects, more boards, more presentations, more everything. Because you don't have anything else to do. And so my advice, especially for women who are working and out there and aren't necessarily in a traditional family structure or have kids, is that you still need balance. And your life cannot become about taking on more work until you get a husband or a partner, right, or kids. That you still need to find a sense of balance and enjoyment. And I think that's something that women outside of work that will help fulfill you. And I agree, the sense of balance is a farce. I think at best you maybe reach a sense of ebb and flow that works for you. And you figure out when you kind of need to tip the scale in the opposite direction. But this idea that in many ways that you're going to take on these really bold, challenging, innovative roles for good and somehow also be able to achieve perfect balance. I think it's just a myth. And in many ways drives us to reach an inobtainable standard. But even if you're a single woman like me, don't allow them to then let that be the excuse for why you should take on everything. Like Nancy, I don't have kids and I've never been married. So, and I will say my personal experiences, I'm not balanced. I really am just like, I realized I just have a passion and I pursue those passions. And that's, it's, I have to work to try to breathe, right? But what I've learned with the work we have done with Building Brave and in talking to women is this high bar that we set for ourselves over and over again in every aspect of our lives. And if you listen to Kathy and to Jan, you realize they had to become accepting of themselves and maybe lower the bar. Yeah. Yeah. And I think we find it. I talked to a lot of women who set a really high bar on everything, on putting meals on the table, on the house they run, on the standard of their kids' birthday parties, on doing it at work, on being the perfect spouse. I mean, just over and over and over again. And we have this one saying at Building Brave, we call it hashtag abandon perfection. It's like sometimes just lower the bar. Right? You just, you're going to drive yourself nuts. And so, so that's the other thing is that takes confidence. It takes confidence to not let other people set the normal for what you, the type of parent you should be, the type of spouse you should be, the type of person you should be at work, the type of social person you should be. All these. You need that confidence to say this is the life that is right for me. And for those I'm close to. And you have to be comfortable with not being, it all being perfect. Yeah. I mean, this totally resonates with me. I'm taking a trillion mental notes because I, because I just jumped into the new mama pool seven weeks ago. Yeah. Thank you. So, so I'm like, okay, good, good. Okay. I don't need it. I don't need to always do all of those, you know, things. But, you know, and it's, it's just, it's incredible. I mean, six, you worked through those six weeks. That's, that's awesome. Cause I could hardly fix a bowl of cereal for myself, like, you know, four weeks in or whatever. But, you know, I, I think, I think it's remarkable after going through, this is my first, my first baby. And, you know, and just going through that experience for me was like, you know, I'm 35 years old. I've always worked with women in my industry that are really strong. Yeah. Strong, childless, you know, like, like kind of go-getters, like usually 10 years, my senior sort of just being the, the Amazons like out there. They're like, they're women that are very strong in my industry that are doing what they're doing. So, so, you know, for me, I'm just like, I was like, wow, like women, you know, women in this, the, the experiences, the, the, I guess the breadth of things that we can do is remarkable. Like, I mean, just physic biomechanics of a woman's body. Like, blows my mind. I still can't believe that we do that, you know. And we, you know, and, and just, you know, and then just that drive too. I mean, you know, it's like this, when you said this is just what we did, you know, this is what we did. It was not even a question. It was just like, no, that's just what you do. And it's like that, I think that women, I think we, I don't know, just maybe automatically kind of put the bar like way high, you know, because we're, we're like super detail oriented. We're always, we're like on par. We're sensitive to. We're bodies are sensitive to like environments. Like, I think that we just have like another lens that, you know, is unique to, to maybe, maybe being a woman. I don't know. You know, I don't want to say that because it's a really broad generality, but, but I do believe that women are like insanely capable of like way more than we, than we even acknowledge before hitting some new, you know, level. So I think that it's, it's just really cool to hear, you know, how, how different levels of. Of motherhood and, and even, you know, just that, that you just, you get through it like, like a warrior because you, you now have a baby that you're like, like you get wrapped, you know, you're just like. I am going to make this work. You know, I don't care what it takes. I'm like, I'm exhausted, but I don't care. You know, so it's awesome. You know, I think it's like, it's a great driver, you know, and, and Andrew and I, we, we work together. We're both entrepreneurs, you know, and it's like. Everybody's kind of told us that they're just like, well, how lucky are you that you just, you know, like you don't have anybody kind of putting any pressure on you. And it's just like, I'm like, I don't, I don't know if that's how that works. You know, like I think that, you know, that we, that nobody cares if we don't go in and therefore we don't get, have an income. So there, there is like a direct, you know, relationship to going back to work and like feeding yourself. So, um, yeah, you know, and, uh, that's always been, you know, but I. I do think that it's like, we're going to make it because I, because I know there's so many women before me that have, that have made it work. So for me, it's like the mirror, you know, where it's like saying this is, you know, mothers have been making babies for like a long time. Um, like forever. Yeah. Like evolution, like sort of relied on that. So, you know, we got this, you know, and, and I think that that, that sense of, I don't know, I, for me, I can visualize like that, that I take that and sort of, uh, somehow. You know, like soak that up into like my own confidence level, or I'm just like, I it'll be fine. I don't know how, but you know, it doesn't matter. We're kind of winding down on time a bit, but I'm wondering if there's anything, um, that like, hasn't been mentioned that you guys particularly would like to speak to, or that you think, I mean, surely you've maybe been a part of, or listened to a lot of conversations about women and leaders and. All that. That, and if there's ever things where you're like, why don't they ever talk about this? Or this is often misunderstood or so, is there anything, I guess, that comes to mind that, um, is on your heart that you're, you just feel strongly or would like to say as far as something we didn't cover or that people often maybe misunderstand or misperceive. I have to add this. I think it's imperative that we all help each other. Uh, we're all in this together. It's imperative that we support young women. Yeah. We're building self-confidence. I mentor two girls, basketball teams, high school girls. Whoa. Do they need support? You know what I mean? They are so fragile and they are, I mean, we're all fragile and the sooner we can get people to feel really good about their success, success breeds success. I know at Kimberly Clark, I finally arrived and gaining self-confidence when they anointed me president of feminine care. The guys didn't care so much because it was feminine care. Okay. And had a great, great track record after that. And so then they added more businesses. And so then I hit it up all the personal care businesses. But I think that the more we can help each other and other young women really aspire to greatness and keep pushing people to greatness because as Alyssa mentioned, I mean, women are incredibly capable. In fact, we exceed expectations in so many regards. And so I think we just all have to reach out and help as many other women as we possibly can.",
